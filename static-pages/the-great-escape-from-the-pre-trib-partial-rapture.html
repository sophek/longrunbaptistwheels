            THE GREAT ESCAPE: FROM THE PRE-TRIB PARTIAL RAPTURE
The Great Escape: From The Pre-Trib Partial Rapture

There seems to be a type of denial going on today concerning the Rapture. The Rapture is what the Bible calls "translation". (Heb.11:5) It is when many Christians disappear to be with Christ in order to escape terrible tribulation. Notice I said "many" Christians. It is right here that the denial comes in. Many of today's popular dispensational preachers rightly believe in a pre-trib rapture. However, most teach that all Christians go in it, contrary to the Scriptures.

I am referring the "great escape" to the denial technique used by modern preachers to escape from the plain teaching of Scripture concerning the rapture. Here is how it works:

"Look, there is a wolf in the pasture".
"I don't need to look you fool! That's not a wolf. That's my young cow."

This man may be pleased with himself that he knows the truth that a cow is not a wolf. Yet, this educated man loses his cow to a wolf. He has missed the point. He was not being told that his cow is really a wolf. (You know, faith is really works, bread is really Jesus, etc.) He is being warned that there is a wolf in the same pasture as his cow!

Now perhaps the reader is bored with such simple logic. Nevertheless, such simplicity of common sense suddenly disappears when it comes to certain doctrines. Ever wonder why? The Bible has the answer. To assent to any truth as being true implies the will. This means that if a person has emotional, passionate motivations for something not being true, he may not assent intellectually to the truth unless he is willing to make the sacrifice. Notice how the Bible (contrary to the great philosophers Col.2:8) teaches that the will is involved in the process of intellectual belief of facts:


James 2:20
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
(Note: the faith in this passage is the faith a Christian exercises to attain reward, which must have works. See Heb.11)
Here one must be willing to know something. (Mtt.13:15) And this is precisely the same problem modern teachers may have with the partial rapture. The Bible teaches that some Christians miss out on the pre-trib rapture because they are unwatchful and disobedient. Now to teach this truth will require the loss of money, fame, esteem, opportunity and popularity. All this because one will not be telling carnal Christians what they wish to hear. (2Tim.4:3)

Perhaps writers such as Hal Lindsey have other motives besides the praise of men for rejecting the truth of the partial rapture. Christ will soon judge and make manifest the motives of all Christians concerning the counsels of our hearts. (1Cor.4:5) Therefore, I will not pretend to know absolutely why any man rejects a truth. Yet, what I can say for certain is that the reasons given by those such as Hal Lindsey for rejecting the partial rapture are so beside the point, that these teachers become stumbling blocks, tempting some young Christians to presumptuously judge their hearts as being hardened by the love of this present world.

For example, in his book The Rapture, Hal Lindsey gives the partial rapture view only a few paragraphs containing only one argument! (p.30) This view was popular in dispensational teaching for over 100 years, yet Hal Lindsey does not let any of his readers know it. Nor does he dare quote any of the arguments or Scriptural proofs from the teachers. In fact, he doesn't even name any teacher that taught it! In fact, the man comes close to lying in print:

"There is a fourth view concerning the Rapture of the Church which has recently been introduced. It is not widely taught, since it is unorthodox and at considerable variance with the Scripture. However it is a view that could gain some following among those who are weak on knowledge of the Word of God..." (p.30, Bantam Books)

Surely Hal Lindsey is aware that the partial, selective rapture has been taught as long as any pre-trib rapture itself has been taught! (1825-? )

Would Mr. Lindsey dare say that G.H.Pember, Hudson Taylor, Robert Govett, D.M.Panton, G.H.Lang, Anthony Norris Groves, Watchman Nee, Seiss, G. Campbell Morgan, Miss A.G. Morgan, A.B. Simpson, John Wilkinson, R.C.Chapman, (to name only a few!) ...would he dare say these are weak on knowledge of the Word? I believe the Holy Spirit has manifested His gracious approval by the fruit and wisdom these preachers brought forth. Surely anyone can see the apparent dishonesty in Mr.Lindsey's treatment of the view. But let us be kind. The Scripture simply doesn't teach that all Christians go in the pre-trib rapture. And it is not easy trying to support error.

But let's let the man speak for himself. Recently Mr. Lindsey was on a Dallas radio station, KRLD. During a call-in program a few men from my church were able to ask him specific questions concerning his rejection of plain Scripture in regards to the partial rapture. Here is the transcript of a few of those calls:

Steve Korenek: "Hi, I'd like to ask Mr. Lindsey a question. It comes in two parts. The first part is this. In Scripture there is usually an O.T. picture.... I understand in his book The Rapture, he doesn't subscribe to the firstfruit rapture theory. But to the contrary, Lk.21:36 says...
.... pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
and Rev.3:10 says... Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

Rev.2:22 implies Thyatira could go through the Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds....

In your book you said a firstfruits or partial rapture is at complete variance with Scripture. But the O.T. lines up with it perfectly. Given the Scripture, how could you say it is at variance with Scripture?"

Hal Lindsey: "Okay, let me suggest something here. You know, one of the most basic principles of interpreting the Bible is that you never prove a major doctrine, major theology, by illustrations, by parables or by types. You must prove these things on the many clear passages that speak on it. And there are many clear passages that show that a Christian is saved not by his own good deeds or not by personal merit, but entirely by what Jesus Christ did for him on the Cross. Christ died for every sin that each person commits. And the only way we can get that pardon He purchased for us is to receive it as a gift. And so in the rapture, 1Cor. for instance Ch.15, says,

51 Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed...

It doesn't distinguish between Christians, any more than you could distinguish between those that are saved, and you know partially saved, or whatever, it's the same issue. Who would be a worthy Christian? The Bible says there's none worthy. So we're not gonna be saved on the basis of good works, and things like that. We're not gonna be raptured on the basis of that."

Notice that Hal Lindsey argued by changing the point. Eternal security was not being debated. Yet he implied that those who teach a partial rapture also teach salvation by works!

Hal Lindsey is not alone in his manner of arguing beside the point concerning the selective rapture of the worthy Christian. G.H.Lang (born 1874) wrote in the middle of this century against such a flimsy mode of arguing:

"...there are some who seek to discredit the doctrine by alleging that it negatives the truth of the eternal salvation of those who are born of God through faith in the Son of God and His atoning work. No accredited teacher of the view in question will admit this, for it is of the essence of our view that we emphasize the contrast between life eternal as a free gift and sharing the glory of Christ as a reward. The assertion serves to give some very greatly needed body and weight to their opposition...the fact that it is found necessary to use this makeweight is silent testimony that the (partial rapture) view is consistent with the faith." (G.H.Lang, The Disciple, p.77-78, Schoettle Pub.Co. P.O. Box 1246, Hayesville, N.C. 28904)

Lang goes on to quote many well known believers in the partial rapture to show they believe in eternal security. He then quotes from Who Will Go When The Lord Comes? by W.R.Lewis and E.W.Rogers. Lang shows how they pretend that partial rapturists deny eternal security and salvation by faith alone. Yet, he notes how they refuse to quote any books in which the arguments are given in favor of the partial rapture! Hal Lindsey later followed the same practice of failing to quote or even name the names of any who held the view in his book The Rapture.

Notice again Hal's response to direct Scriptures on the partial rapture:

Host: "Michael in Bedford, you're on with Hal."
Michael Rupp: "Yes, Mr. Lindsey?"
Hal: "Yes?"
Michael: "You say that all Christians are going to be raptured out before the Tribulation?"
Hal: "Yes, that's my belief."
Michael: "Okay, well thereâ€™s a couple of verses in the Bible that kinda speak otherwise. Rev. 3:10. Are you familiar with that one? A Christian after he is saved, heâ€™s saved eternally. We know that. But do you believe a Christian can still willfully sin and get punished after he is saved?"
Hal: "Well can you tell me a sin thatâ€™s not willful? Sin by definition is an act of the will."
Michael: "Well in the Old Testament you had two sins. You had an ignorant sin, which you did unknowingly. You had a willful, blatant sin... Ps.51, David says Iâ€™d bring You a sacrifice, but it wouldnâ€™t cover it. He committed adultery. The Old Testamentâ€™s just a shadow of the New Testament right?"
Hal: ..."Well you know you can go through the New Testament and find that there are all kinds of willful sins that are talked about. 1Cor. ch. 6 deals with some of the people of the Church going back to the old religion which included temple prostitutes, the Temple of Aphrodite there at Corinth. And he tells them to stop, to repent, yet he doesnâ€™t tell them they are lost."


These radio answers are consistent with Hal Lindseyâ€™s one argument against the partial rapture that he gives in his book The Rapture:

"This view is in direct contradiction to one of the most central and important doctrines of all, that of salvation by grace through faith alone." (p.30)

Mr. Lindsey never explains why missing the rapture to him, has to mean losing eternal salvation. His only words on it are: "The Rapture must be based on the same principles as salvation". (p.43)

In conclusion, Hal Lindsey, has compromised the Scripture. Only God knows if he has purposely compromised it. Self deception is a powerful force within us. Hal Lindsey has greatly stood for Israel and the fact that we are in the last days. I praise God for those like Mr. Lindsey who awake Christians to the signs of this age. Even so, many believers are not being warned so they may prepare themselves before it is too late. That is tragic. Many Christians will hear the words of Hal Lindsey and remain in a slothful state, for they have nothing to fear according to Hal, except losing a few crowns in the bliss of Heaven.

It would be less horrible if Hal Lindsey and other men of God would appear more honest in books by stating the abundance of Scripture where God directly warns His people of experiencing the Tribulation Period. Surely, it would be safe to mention that history is filled with devoted Christians who have taught that the Pre-trib Rapture can only be attained by watching for the Savior in holiness and readiness. Such a teaching has manifested fruit in the lives of many disciples as they moved with fear to live obediently. Does Hal want to gamble with the lives of Christians? Let us continually lift him up in prayer.


Hebrews 11:
5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

Luke 21:36
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

Revelation 22:18
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

Revelation 3:10
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

Hebrews 9:28
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

Revelation 2:22
Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

Mark 13:
34 For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
"It is deplorable how stoutly the heart can resist after all the batteries of the intellect have been put out of action;.. ..The motive being the desire to get rid of all responsibility in the case of Christian believers. This is a grievous error, and those who propagate it will bitterly regret their folly when they stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ."

G.H. Pember
Very soon many Christians will be left watching C.N.N. with the reality that they were not translated. They will pay for believing in a false priesthood of scholars to interpret for them. Yet what shall be the reward of those teachers? Only Christ knows. Yet, we do well to take heed:

Luke 17:2
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

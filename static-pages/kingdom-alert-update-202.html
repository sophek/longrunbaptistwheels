==============================================================

THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM IS THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH-REST: WHY THE 7000 YEAR
PLAN IS STILL A POSSIBILITY

Isaiah 46:9 ...I am God, and there is none like me,
10 Declaring the end from the beginning...

Genesis (the "beginning"), records that there were six, literal days of
creation. On the seventh day, God rested. There is evidence that this
pattern is a prophecy of the entire history of mankind, which will
culminate in the Millennial Kingdom of REST at the second coming of Jesus:

Isaiah 11:6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; and a little child shall lead them.
10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for
an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and HIS REST shall
be glorious.

Indeed, the Epistle to the Hebrews calls this "world to come" the SEVENTH
DAY:

Hebrews 2:5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the WORLD TO
COME, whereof WE SPEAK.

Hebrews 4:1 Let US therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of
entering into HIS REST, any of you should seem to come short of it.
4 For he spake in a certain place of the SEVENTH DAY on this wise, And God
did REST the seventh day from all his works.
5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into MY REST.
9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
11 Let US LABOUR therefore to enter into THAT REST, lest any man fall
after the same example of unbelief.

Hebrews 6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
faith AND PATIENCE inherit the promises.

Hebrews 12:28 Wherefore we receiving A KINGDOM which cannot be moved, let
us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear:

The 1000-year Kingdom (unlike the eternal age which follows it) is a PRIZE
to be awarded to believers who have exercised faith and patience, and
properly responded to their promises and warnings. It is an earned reward
(2 Timothy 2:12, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, Galatians 5:21), given to every
saint who will respond to God's sanctifying grace with godly fear and
diligence (Hebrews 12:15, 28, Galatians 5:16). Eternity, on the other
hand, is a free gift, by grace, through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9,
Romans 4:5).

The coming, Millennial Kingdom is called "his rest" (Isaiah 11:10, Hebrews
4:1, 5). It is the "seventh day." The Bible teaches that a "day" is as
1000 years with God:

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation.
8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that ONE DAY is with
the Lord as a THOUSAND YEARS, and a thousand years as one day.
 
It is significant, in light of these verses, that the coming Kingdom is
1000 years (before the eternal kingdom):

Revelation 20:6 ....they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall
reign with him a THOUSAND years.

This Kingdom is called "his rest." It is called the "seventh day." It is
1000 years in duration. There is therefore Biblical evidence that the
Millennial Kingdom will actually be the seventh millennium (i.e. 7th day)
of man's history.

When this teaching is compared with other Scriptures, it is marvelously
confirmed:

Mark 9:2 And AFTER SIX DAYS Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and
he was TRANSFIGURED before them.

It was AFTER "six days" that the Lord was transfigured. This was a picture
of the Lord's second coming in His Millennial glory. Notice how Peter
later described this event:

2 Peter 1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we
made known unto you the power and COMING of our Lord Jesus Christ, but
were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

In Exodus 12:3, we have a hint of the duration from Adam to Christ's
ministry:

Exodus 12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
TENTH day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb...
6 And ye shall keep it up until the FOURTEENTH day of the same month: and
the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the
evening.

It appears that there were "four days" (4000 years) from the foundation of
the world till sometime near the crucifixion of Jesus. The Bible teaches
that the remaining "days" are the "last days":

1 Corinthians 10:11 ...they are written for our admonition, upon whom the
ENDS OF THE WORLD are come.

Hebrews 1:2 Hath in THESE LAST DAYS spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;

We are now living in the "last days" of these "last days." This final age
(after the 1st coming of Jesus), will be SHORTER than the former age:

1 Corinthians 7:29 But this I say, brethren, the TIME IS SHORT: it
remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

Romans 13:12 The night is FAR SPENT, the day is at hand: let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

Hebrews 10:37 For yet a LITTLE WHILE, and he that shall come will come,
and will not tarry.

Philippians 4:5 ...The Lord is AT HAND.

1 Peter 4:7 But THE END of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
and watch unto prayer.

Therefore, it fits perfectly to see the final age as only "two days." This
age would be the "last days," and since the period would be shorter than
the former period, there would be a greater urgency and responsibility
associated with it.

There are other verses that reveal that the seven days are a prophetic
pattern:

Hosea 6:2 After TWO DAYS will he revive us: in the third day he will raise
us up, and we shall live in his sight.

The final restoration of Israel will take place after "two days." Such
prophecies often hold multiple fulfillments:

John 2:1 And the THIRD DAY there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
the mother of Jesus was there: [See Revelation 19:7]

Jesus establishes His Kingdom on the "third day" (counting from the end of
the fourth), the day of resurrection life and manifestation:

Acts 10:40 Him God raised up the THIRD DAY, and shewed him openly;
 
==============================================
The Remarkable History of This Interpretation
==============================================

Joseph Mede (1586-1638) writes:

"...it is true that the primitive fathers...conceived the world would
last...6000 years, and that the seventh thousand should be the Day of
Judgment and Sabbath...so Irenaeus...Justin Martyr...Lactantius....The
ancient Jews also had a tradition to the same purpose, as appears by these
testimonies recorded in the Gemara...of their Talmud..."
("The Works of the Pious and Profoundly-Learned Joseph Mede," London:
1672)

Thomas Burnett (1635-1715) also provides a detailed history of this view:
 
"The Jews have a remarkable prophecy, which expresseth both the whole and
the parts of the world's duration. The world, they say, will stand six
thousand years: two thousand before the law, two thousand under the law,
and two thousand under the Messiah. This prophecy they derive from
Elias....the prophecy itself concerning the sexmillennial duration of the
world, is very much insisted upon by the Christian fathers; which yet, I
believe, is not so much for the bare authority of the tradition, as
because they thought it was founded in the history of the six days'
creation and the sabbath succeeding: as also in some other typical
precepts and usages in the law of Moses....Of this opinion was St.
Barnabas in his...epistle, chap. xv. where he argues that the creation
will be ended in six thousand years, as it was finished in six days: every
day according to the sacred and mystical account, being a thousand years.
Of the same judgment is Irenaeus, both as to the conclusion and the reason
of it (lib. v. chap. 28, 29, 30). He saith, the history of the creation in
six days, is a narration as to what is past, and a prophecy of what is to
come. As the work was said to be consummated in six days, and the sabbath
to be the seventh; so the consummation of all things will be in the six
thousand years, and then the great sabbathism to come on in the blessed
reign of Christ. Hippolytus Martyr, disciple of Irenaeus, is of the same
judgment, as you may see in Photius (chap. ccii). Lactantius, in his
Divine Institutions (lib. vii. chap. 14.), gives the very same account of
the state and continuance of the world, and the same proofs for it, and so
does St. Cyprian in his Exhortation to Martyrdom (chap. xviii). St Jerome
more than once declares himself of the same opinion....So Johannes
Damascenus [de Fide Orthodoxa] takes seven millennaries for the entire
space of the world, from the creation to the general resurrection, the
sabbathism being included. And that this was a received and approved
opinion in early times, we may collect from the author of the questions
and answers, 'ad Orthodoxos,' in Justin Martyr, who, giving an answer to
that inquiry about the six thousand years' term of the world, says, 'We
may conjecture, from many places of scripture, that those are in the right
that say six thousand years is the time prefixed for the duration of this
present frame of the world.' These authors I have examined myself; but
there are many others brought in confirmation of this opinion: as St.
Hilary, Anastasius, Sinatia, Sanctus Gaudentius, Q. Julius Hilarion,
Julinius Africanus, Isidorus Hispalensis, Cassiodorus, Gregorius Magnus,
and others....it must be confessed that many of these fathers were under a
mistake in one respect....they reckoned this prophecy according to the
chronology of the Septuagint, which, setting back the beginning of the
world many ages beyond the Hebrew, these six thousand years were very near
expired in the time of those fathers..."
(Bishop Burnett, "The Sacred Theory of the Earth," London: T. Kinnersely;
edition printed in 1816)

Thomas Newton (1703-1784) writes:

"But of all the prophets St. John is the only one who hath declared
particularly and in express terms, that the martyrs shall rise to partake
of the felicities of this kingdom, and that it shall continue upon earth a
thousand years: and the Jewish church before him, and the Christian church
after him, have farther believed and taught, that these thousand years
will be the SEVENTH millennary of the world. A POMPOUS HEAP of quotations
might be produced to this purpose both from Jewish and Christian
writers....Tradition assents to Rabbi Ketina: 'As out of seven years every
seventhh is the day of remission, so out of the seven thousand years of
the world the seventh millennary shall be the millennary of remission,
that God alone may be exalted in that day.'....Of the Christian writers
St. Barnabas in the first century thus comments upon the words of Moses,
'And God made in six days the works of his hands...Consider, children,
what that signifies, that the Lord God will finish all things in six
thousand years. For a day with him is a thousand years, as he himself
testifieth....And he rested the seventh day: this signifies, that when his
son shall come, and shall abolish the season of the wicked one...then he
shall rest gloriously in that seventh day.'....Lactantius at the beginning
of the fourth century is very copious upon this subject in the seventh
book of his Divine Institutions. He saith, 'Because all the works of God
were finished in six days, it is necessary that the world should remain in
this state six ages, that is six thousand years....at the end of the six
thousandth year...justice should reign for a thousand years....This is the
doctrine of the holy prophets which we Christians follow; this is our
wisdom. ("Dissertations on the Prophecies," Vol. III, London: 1759,
pp.334-341)

George N. H. Peters (1825-1909) testifies:

"Writers inform us that this Jewish opinion of the seventh Millennary,
however we may account for it, was CONTINUED in the Christian, Jewish, and
Gentile churches established by the apostles and their successors, and
that it was entertained BOTH by Millenarians [premillennialists] and their
opponents. This is abundantly confirmed by a little research.
Papias...makes the days of creation typical [prophetical]....Such is the
opinion of Irenaeus (Adv. Haer., 5), Justin Martyr (Ques. and Ans., 71,
Dial. with Try.), Polycarp (see testimony of Irenaeus concerning him...),
Tertullian (Ag. Marcion, B. 3, c. 24, etc.), Lactantius (Div. Insti., c.
14, 24, 26), Cyprian (see Exh. Mart., 11), Ambrose (In Luc.,
8:23)....Commodianus (The Instructions, S. 80) says the res. of the saints
takes place 'when six thousand years are completed.'....The martyr,
Victorinus (On the Creation of the World), remarks, 'that the true Sabbath
will be the seventh Millenary of years, when Christ with His elect shall
reign.'...Bardesan (Book of the Laws...) speaks of 'the establishment of a
new world,' after an expiration of six thousand years, thus showing how
widespread was the opinion that the earth in its present form would only
endure six thousand years....Luther, Melanchthon, R. Abraham, Aben Ezra,
R. ben Israel, mede Newton, Bengel, Chas. Wesley, Cowper, Adam Clarke,
Fleming, and many others in later times [held this view]....John Bunyan
(First Chaps. Genesis) advocates 'the glory that the Church shall have in
the latter day, even in the SEVENTH THOUSANDTH YEAR of the world, that
SABBATH when Christ shall set up His Kingdom on earth.'....It is a
singular fact, as the reader must already have noticed in the names of the
advocates adduced, that not merely Pre-Millennarians, but those who are
Post-Millenarians - who spiritualize the res. and Mill., etc. - also adopt
this view with reference to their spiritual Millennium, or as
Anti-Millenarians in relation to the ending of this dispensation....Now,
to return to the use made by Paul of this opinion entertained by the Jews.
Brought up under Gamaliel, he must have known how the Jews regarded the
Sabbath as typical of the reign of the Messiah, etc. hence, the references
made by him to this opinion, and their future application to Jesus Christ
is a virtual endorsement of the same. We have first, his declaration, Col.
2:16,17, that 'the Sabbaths are a shadow of things to come,' viz. typical
of things future as related to Christ. Second: the 'Rest' which the Jews
attributed to the Messianic reign, he applies, 2 Thess. 1:7, to the period
of the future revelation of Jesus from heaven. The very phrase current to
designate Millennial glory (comp. Isa.11:10), Paul refers to the Second
Advent. Third: The manner in which he employs the word 'Rest' in Hebrews,
being addressed to Jews, could not but confirm them in their belief of the
future reign of the Messiah during the seventh Millenary...." (Peters,
"The Theocratic Kingdom, Vol. 2)

Finally, E. B. Elliott (1793-1875) writes:

"The fact of the Jewish pre-Christian church having long and fixedly
entertained the opinion that the Messiah's kingdom of blessedness would
occupy the seventh millennium of the world, agreeably with the type of the
seventh day's sabbatism of rest after the six days of creation, is well
known....observes Dr. Whitby on Heb. iv.9, 'he refers to their (the Jews')
common opinion that the world should continue 6000 years, and then a
perpetual sabbath begin, typified by God's resting the seventh day, and
blessing it.' (For 'perpetual' Whitby should have perhaps said a
'millennial' sabbath...)...St. Paul's use of the word...'sabbatism,' to
designate the saints' expected glorious time of REST with Christ, might
also be construed as his approbatory recognition of it: especially
considering that it was HEBREW Christians whom he was then addressing; and
that by them the word thus chosen could not but be almost necessarily
associated, from long national usage, with some chronological
septenary....In fact, among the Christian fathers that succeeded the
apostolic age, this view of the matter was UNIVERSALLY received and
promulgated."
("Horae Apocalypticae," fifth edition, 1862)

Although additional quotes could be endlessly multiplied, the above
excerpts should serve to alert the reader to the rich acceptance this view
has received throughout history.

=====================================================================
Scoffers Rebuked: The Most Predicted Date for the End of the Age was
Somewhere Around the Year 2000
=====================================================================

There have certainly been over-zealous students of the prophecies
throughout the centuries. In response to this, the Devil has taught
Christians to take pride in themselves if they believe the Lord delays His
coming, and that we should not watch for it! But this is the very sin our
Lord rebuked!:

Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
delayeth his coming;

Therefore, Christians are not "sober and wise" if they choose to refrain
from watching and stirring themselves concerning the Lord's soon coming.
Jesus Christ calls them EVIL! Peter calls them SCOFFERS. There are many
"scholars" who are quick to give the modern Christian a "history" lesson,
showcasing the people that have wrongly set dates for the Lord's coming.
They will neglect to give quotes from some of the most POPULAR and SKILLED
writers of prophecy who said, based on the 6000 year plan, that the end of
the age (Second Coming) would not occur until around the year 2000:

"The great period of a thousand years, in which the church shall enjoy
unexampled peace and felicity, is yet to begin. Its commencement is
expected by THE MOST JUDICIOUS COMMENTATORS, at a time, near the year
2000."
(Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817)

"The world was ordained to endure AS ALL LEARNED MEN AFFIRM...six thousand
years. Now, of that number there be past five thousand five hundred and
fifty-two years, so that there is no more left but four hundred and
forty-eight years." (Bh. Latimer, 1490-1555, "Sermon on the Lord's
Prayer," No. 3)

Notice the following words of one of the most well-know prophecy writers
in America in the 19th century:

"In what year of the world's age we are living, it is not possible at this
day to accurately ascertain. According to the COMMON RECKONING, it will
yet be about one hundred and thirty-five years to the end of the six
thousand." (Joseph Seiss, "Lecture on 2 Peter 3," 1865)

===================================================================
How Did All Of These Christians Stay Ready For The Lord's Coming?
===================================================================

How did all these "learned men" stay ready and alert, if so many viewed
the end of the age (based on the six days) at around the year 2000? Easy.
They simply realized that the Lord could (and they taught that He probably
would) cut the days short! Therefore, although they looked for the
"technical" end of the age around the year 2000, they remained alert and
ready "just in case" it occurred beforehand.

Furthermore, futurists such as Seiss, taught that the exact length of the
Tribulation Period was open to debate.

Finally, earlier saints were quick to notice that there since there is
much debate about the exact chronology, we perhaps cannot know exactly
when the 6000 years will end. Joseph Mede, after noting the differing
chronologies, writes:

"But the thing I aim at...is, whether there may or may not be some secret
disposition of Divine Providence in this variety of computation, to
prevent our curiosity in counting the exact time of the Day of Judgment
and Second Coming." ("Mede's Works," 1672)

=================================
Why This View Is Still Probable
=================================

We have now past the year 2000 by almost 3.5 years. Does this prove that
the view of the six days as a prophecy should be discarded? No. First,
there are so many stage-setting signs occurring in our day, that we almost
have to be drunk with a deluded spirit to conclude that God is not
bringing man's rebellion to a climax. Second, it has already been
demonstrated that the final period (New Testament age) is said to be
shorter than the former period. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude
that the former period was four days in length (4000 years), and the final
period will be two days in length (2000 years).

It might not be as difficult to determine where the four days ended, as it
might be to tell where they began. It is very possible that Jesus gives us
a hint:

Luke 16:16 The law and the prophets were UNTIL JOHN: since THAT TIME the
kingdom of God is PREACHED, and every man presseth into it.

Matthew 11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied UNTIL JOHN.

The beginning of the MINISTRY (not birth) of John the Baptist may very
well be the end of the fourth day, and the start of the fifth day. It is
common among interpreters to see the number five, as the number of
"grace," and/or the number of "death":

John 1:17 For the law was given by Moses, but GRACE and truth came by
Jesus Christ.

Concerning the Adamic creation, it is obvious that the Septuagint date of
5270 is way off the mark. Ussher (1581-1656) calculated the creation at
4004 B.C. But is there any evidence for an even LATER date of creation
that that given by Ussher? Notice the following dates given by various
chronologists and Biblical interpreters:

Kepler: 3993
Petavius: 3984
Melanchthon: 3964
Luther: 3961
Lightfoot: 3960
Dean Coombs: 3960
Lipman: 3916
Ancient Jewish Scholars: 3761

Obviously, based on the above chronologies, placing a four day period
(4000 years) between the Adamic creation (in Genesis 1), and the beginning
of the MINISTRY of John the Baptist, is not at all far-fetched.
 
In conclusion, there is yet NO REASON at all to scratch the view that the
six days of creation are also a prophecy. Based on our Lord's words
concerning John, the idea of a later creation than Ussher calculated, is
highly probable. (By "Adamic creation," I do not refer to the Luciferic
creation - see Ezekiel 28). Let us watch and be sober! The Lord is at
hand!

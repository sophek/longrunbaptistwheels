        <h1>FORT WORTH POLICE SEND LESBIAN-LOOKING POLICE Â€ŒWOMANÂ€ TO ARREST CHRISTIAN</h1>
        <div id="content">
            The Christians were prohibited from coming close to the Fort Worth  Convention Center, even though there was plenty of public sidewalk in  front of it. This was a denial of rights. They chose to exclude certain  people based on religious belief, while others, that appeared to agree  with sodomy, were allowed to enter. It is one thing to forbid truly  unlawful conduct. It is quite another thing to forbid people from  speaking their views on a public sidewalk, when others are on the  sidewalk spewing forth their own views, along with lewd gyrations, and  foul language. Finally, the lesbian-looking police â€œwomanâ€ came over to a  preacher and began to arrest him for doing nothing but standing back  where police had told him to stand. He was not in the road, or near the  so-called â€œforbidden area.â€ He was standing there preaching, and they  arrested him. They handcuffed him behind his back, and made him sit inÂ a  police car for a very long time, until they took him to jail. He is  awaiting his charges, but we have heard that they are attempting to  charge him with the vague â€œdisorderly conduct.â€ They only arrested one  evangelist, out of many. This was their â€œofferingâ€ to the homosexual  crowd. They all applauded as the lesbian-looking police â€œwomanâ€ removed  this man from exercising his Constitutional, and God-given rights. Even  if they try to drop the charges, they have detained this man, removed  him from preaching, and have handcuffed him behind his back for a  ridiculous amount of time, as they smirked, and finally took him to  jail. We will soon make the video available so that all may see that  this man was not â€œdisorderlyâ€ â€“ unless you happen to be a  lesbian-looking police-woman! I am sureÂ many considered any  preaching against their destructive, unnatural lifestyles (paraded in  front of children), as disorderly. Shame on these representatives of the  Fort Worth police. How far will they go to kiss theÂ feet of the  homosexual community?Â  They started off the day by trying to tell us  that it was not legal to have a blow horn in the city! After telling them  that we know the law, they backed off, and things went decently well.  Of course, they chose to have us walk down the sidewalk with signs, in  the midst of the homosexual crowds. This produced many provocations, and assault by homosexuals, that we chose to ignore. We told them it would  be far more reasonable to have us go down the street. Yet, they denied  this, and made us walk down the crowded sidewalks. But they then showed  their foolishness by trying to detain us for a time, under the guise of  crowd-control. When we would no longer be detained, they let us go, only  to tell us that we were not permitted to go near the Convention Center â€“  even on the public sidewalk. Fort Worth police needs to learn some  serious lessons about equal rights. There were many â€œhigh fivesâ€ as they  tried to make the homosexuals feel better in the midst of the  preaching. The arrest of a protestor by the lesbian-looking police woman  (who tried hard to be manly), was apparently their sweet little  offering to the pathetic parade.Â God help us. Vengeance belongs to the  Lord.

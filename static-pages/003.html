How Glorious IS the Bride?

I just love the Psalms! I have been teaching through them in my Women's Sunday School class for over a year so far, and you can believe that we have hit just about every major subject in the Bible. Psalm 45 is a particularly incredible chapter. God the Father is speaking of His Son, Jesus. It goes on to talk of the judgment of the earth (vs. 3-6), and then of the marriage supper (found in Rev. 19 and 20) and the Bride of Christ.

As I was reading this Psalm, verse 13 jumped out at me:

Ps 45:13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.

As I was meditating on this, I began to think of what Jesus says in Luke 18:8 "&Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" I began to wonder "How glorious IS the bride?"

I am so thankful to know that there are many families who are boldly seeking holiness. I have gotten many letters from women telling me of their struggles and victories in seeking out God's will for their lives. They are stepping away from the world, as far as they can, yet still being lights to the world. They are putting away worldly programming and entertainment in order to protect their family's purity, bringing their children home from public schools, and in general, just purifying their lives of worldliness. But just looking at the mass majority of churches and Christians, I am filled with sorrow. It seems that some folks want to see just how close they can get to the world. In many areas, they are fully IN the world, and
when you tell them what they are doing is wrong, they label you a "legalist."

I was struck by the following verses:

Ps 45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

In Verse 10, the Lord is telling us that He wants us to forget the things we learned before coming to Him. To show us the importance, He tells us to "hearken," "consider" and to "incline thine ear." When we come to Christ, we must challenge everything we once thought was right or wrong, and RELEARN everything! We are new creatures! We are of a different Spirit than the world, and therefore must walk
by that Spirit. The world is not going to understand us, nor is it going to like us, which is why many will seek to escape eternal damnation through Jesus, but few will seek to actually become His disciple.

When we seek to be disciples of Jesus, we must spend time with Him in order to find out what He wants us to do. Though the whole world accepts something as being okay, we must seek the Lord's will on the subject, and not just accept the world's ways blindly. We must rethink everything in our lives! As a Christian, I should wear
different clothes, listen to different music, speak different words and talk about different things, have a different attitude, have different entertainment, than I did when I was in the world. If you as a woman learned from the world to "snub" others you are angry at by ignoring them and giving mean looks or whatever, do you really think it is proper to bring that into the church? Does it have any place at all in your Christian walk? Let your words be kind and holy. If the world taught you that good entertainment was watching others have affairs, killing one another, speaking rudely to one another or any number of things on TV, why would it be okay to bring
it into a home that acknowledges Jesus Christ as Lord? We must question what we have always accepted as right, unless we got it from the Word.

11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.

When we learn and receive the things of Christ and "forget" the old things we once lived by, verse 11 tells us that we become beautiful to the Lord. It is a beauty that honors Him, and it is a beauty that He greatly desires. He becomes not only our Saviour, but also our Lord. Only then will we really know how to worship Him.

Ps 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the BEAUTY OF HOLINESS.

I want to be beautiful like that to the Lord! I want Him to be pleased with me as one who does His will! I know you do also. Who wouldn't want His praise?

Ps 45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.

In verse 16 the Lord shows us that though we won't have the glory of our "fathers," who would picture the world, we will have the glory of "children." I believe that the children would be those who we bring to the Lord. Only for a little while on this earth do we have this opportunity to bring others to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Let us spread the earth with "princes"!

Become His beautiful bride who is "glorious within." Seek to be worthy of the garments that are "of wrought gold" that He may one day place upon you.

Keeping Healthy

Teatree (sometimes called Melaleuca) Oil

The teatree is a tropical plant that grows only in a few places in the U.S. It is a wonderful antiseptic, and has many other uses.

The book "The Green Pharmacy" says:

"Teatree oil was used by Australian aborigines and early settlers to treat abrasions, athlete's foot, bug bites, burns and cuts. Its use as a wound treatment has spread around the world. There's good reason for this, as it contains the powerful antiseptic compound terpinen-4-ol."

"I have personally used teatree oil as an externally applied antiseptic for abscesses, and I can attest to its value. It is well proven as an antiseptic against bacteria and fungi. In fact, teatree oil is just as good as any of those nonherbal antiseptics Mother used to use-iodine and mercurochrome." (Pgs. 184-185)

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed a round rash on a little girl at my church. Knowing that it was ringworm, I went to her parents and told them what it was. When they asked me how to treat it, I told them to apply tea tree oil to the area a few times a day, which successfully cured it. I have used it for the same purpose on my own children when they had ringworm.

Tea tree oil will also cure athlete's foot and other yeast type (even feminine, e-mail me for the recipe) infections by applying a few times a day.

-Never ingest teatree oil! It is a powerful essential oil, and could be harmful.

Note: All herbs are powerful and must be used with wisdom! Please discuss them with your healthcare provider before use).

On a Personal Note
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

My husband and I just returned from a long trip to his home state, South Carolina. Unfortunately, we didn't go for a vacation, but because his grandmother was sick. She was in the hospital due to a minor stroke, and all thought she was going to recover until several days later when she had several more strokes. Joey and I packed up the kids and took the 1000 mile trip to be at her side. We thankfully made it in time. We were all able to kiss her, love her, and pray, sing and read the Bible to her. Though she was no longer able to speak, she let us know she knew we were there by squeezing our hands when we asked her to, and responding in other ways.

The Lord blessed us in many ways while we were there. He sent us a dear sweet sister in the Lord, Patricia, to comfort us by bringing a care package full of good things to the hospital, as well as coming to visit with the family each day to encourage us.

We were so thankful to be able to minister to Joey's grandmother in her time of need. Joey spent each night with her in her hospital room, and one night the Lord gave him Psalm 71 to read to her. He was amazed and comforted to find that it fit her situation perfectly.

My husband preached his grandmother's funeral a few days later, and his text was Psalm 71. Before he began his message, he called a pastor, who was a friend of the family to say a few words. Amazingly, though he had all of the Bible to choose from, this pastor read from the same text, Psalm 71. God's presence was so evident! The whole family was comforted when Joey began his message and told everyone what the Lord had done.

We never know when a loved one will be called Home. This experience was certainly a reminder to our family to love one another more fervently. Sisters, take each day as a blessing from God, and live it to the fullest in His power! Don't get so caught up in your own day to day trials that you don't keep your eyes on how to teach your children to love Jesus more. They won't be little and in your care forever! Those who are your elders won't always be here either. Take time to let them be a part of your family by keeping them updated on the little things that will interest only them. I will never regret the time and money I spent on the phone sharing sweet things with Joey's grandmother, or the times we went for visits. Be a blessing to whom ever the Lord has given you!

Ps 71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
18 Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

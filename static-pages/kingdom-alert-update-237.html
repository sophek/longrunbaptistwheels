WHY BACKSLIDERS BUILD A CITY IN WANDER-LAND (Sermon, by J. Faust)
************************************************************************

TEXT: Proverbs 14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou
perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.
8 The wisdom of the prudent is to UNDERSTAND HIS WAY: but the folly of
fools IS DECEIT.
12 There is A WAY which SEEMETH RIGHT unto a man, but the end thereof are
the ways of death.
14 The BACKSLIDER in heart shall be filled with HIS OWN WAYS: and a good
man shall be satisfied from himself.

Verse 8 teaches us that a prudent believer WILL NOT DECEIVE HIMSELF. He
understands his way. He does not go the way of the fool. The fool's way is
folly. The fool deceives himself. His way SEEMS right to him, but it is
the way of backsliding. It ends in death. He does not always REALIZE that
he is backsliding. He may think he is taking a stand, etc. But his OWN
WAYS will not produce real satisfaction and inward peace in the end
(v.14). Such backsliding produces self-pity and bitterness, and finally,
hatred.

The New Testament warns that in the last days, many churches will be
filled with people who go the way of the fool. They will deceive
themselves. They will be going the way of the backslider, sliding down
unto death; but they will feel and "sense" that they are on the RIGHT WAY!
Some of the words of the Epistle of Jude may be interpreted as applying to
"false professing religionists" (i.e. unsaved liberals, Romanists, etc.).
But their form of godliness, mixed with lasciviousness and a
feeling-oriented life, will certainly also affect multitudes of true
believers to one degree or another. Let us therefore, in this sermon,
apply the words of Jude to true believers, that we may not miss the
Spirit's rebuke. Do any of the following words apply to your life?:

Jude 1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt
themselves.
11 WOE UNTO THEM! FOR THEY HAVE GONE IN THE WAY OF CAIN...
12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you,
feeding themselves without fear: CLOUDS THEY ARE WITHOUT WATER, CARRIED
ABOUT OF WINDS, trees WHOSE FRUIT WITHERETH, without fruit, twice dead,
PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS;
13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; WANDERING STARS,
to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
16 These are MURMURERS, COMPLAINERS, walking after their own lusts; and
their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in
admiration because of advantage.
19 These be they who SEPARATE THEMSELVES, SENSUAL, having not the Spirit.

1. Notice that these people are very feeling oriented, but they don't
realize it (v.10, 19).

2. They go the way of Cain, which leads to destruction.

3. They are unstable (v.12). They are very impressionable. They ride
whatever new wind blows. They are not pillars. They do not go from the
presence of foolishness (Prov.14:7). They feed on it. They think it is the
way of truth.

4. Notice, they backslide (i.e. fruit withereth, v.12). Not only their own
fruits, but their disciples and people they have taken under their wings
leave their churches, leave their marriages, and/or never thrive in
holiness. Rebels produce rebels. Like begets like.

5. They have no stability, loyalty, or lasting commitment (i.e. plucked up
by their roots, v.12). Since they have no roots, whatever wind blows, be
it a soft, happy wind, or a raging tempest of tribulation, they are moved
from their place.

6. They murmur and complain as a cover to try to make their own
backsliding smell good. The majority of backsliders will always hide their
backsliding under the bedcovers of some issue or issues. It temporarily
appeases their consciences, and they THINK it protects their testimonies.
(Backsliders are often more interested in how people perceive them than
anything else. That is why they flee when no one pursues and become so
suspicious of everyone.)

 7. They cannot be trusted (see v. 16). They are double-tongued. They will
not keep their words. They are slippery and deceitful.

8. Finally, since they are "feeling-oriented," they end up separated (v.
19) from where they should be, and where they would have been if they
would not have deceived themselves with their own feelings and folly!

This all certainly matches the way of the fool and the backslider in our
chapter of Proverbs. Jude calls it the WAY OF CAIN.

Let's discuss the "way of Cain" for a moment. The story of Cain is found
in Genesis 4. God apparently commanded a blood offering, but Cain brought
his bloodless vegetables, which messed up the picture of Jesus. It was
like Moses striking the Rock twice. Jesus, the Rock, would only be smitten
once for sins! Moses distorted the picture. God does not like His pictures
being spoiled. Therefore, the way of Cain, when applied to an UNBELIEVER,
is trying to come to God by good works, instead of by the Blood of Jesus,
though faith alone. It is true legalism, or trying to be justified by the
law. It speaks of bloodless liberalism, or sacramentalism, which denies
the substitutionary atonement of our Lord death, or its sole efficiency
before the Father.

But there is more to it. It also speaks of the way that a deceived
BELIEVER can go when he backslides. Abel WALKED by faith; Cain did not:

Hebrews 11:4 BY FAITH ABEL offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God
testifying of his gifts...

When a Christian fails to live up to God's standard in a certain area,
because of a lack of faith, or trust in God, if he does not repent, he
will usually then do two things:

1. He will fall into even greater sin and darkness, while thinking he is
going in the way that is right.

2. He will immerse himself into diversions, distractions, often adding to
the Word of God, as an outward covering or justification for his failure.
These projects or "holy works" (which may not be bad in themselves) are
used to cover the guilt of the backslider. The backslider may feel guilty
because he has betrayed a trust, has not been a stable pillar, has not
kept his own word, has not obeyed Matthew 18 in how to deal with personal
disputes, has allowed natural affection to overrule spiritual principles
and commands from the Scriptures, etc. Whatever the failing, such sins
bring the bitter pain of guilt. Confession (before God; and man, when
necessary), and true repentance will heal the wounds of guilt. But too
often, pride will not suffer the backslider to admit the error and folly
of his ways. Therefore, to blunt the pain of guilt, the backslider will
immerse himself in projects and good endeavors, by which he hopes to show
forth the appearance of thriving spiritually, to himself and others. But
in the end such works of the flesh (done for wrong motives, and often in
the wrong manner) will scatter in the same winds that first blew the
backslider from the place God had planted him:

Proverbs 14:14 The BACKSLIDER in heart shall be filled with HIS OWN
WAYS...

And the really sad thing is that the backslider DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ANY OF
THESE THINGS CONCERNING HIMSELF:

Proverbs 14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to UNDERSTAND HIS WAY: but the
folly of fools IS DECEIT.
12 There is A WAY which SEEMETH RIGHT unto a man, but the end thereof are
the ways of death.

Jude 1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not...

Of course, it goes without saying that this all ends in a backslidden
SEPARATION
(outwardly and inwardly) from God AND THE BRETHREN WHO ARE IN GOD'S
WILL:

Genesis 4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat
thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very
wroth, and his countenance fell.
6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou
shalt rule over him.
8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
were in the field, that CAIN ROSE UP AGAINST ABEL HIS BROTHER, AND SLEW
HIM.
9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I
know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
her strength; a fugitive and a VAGABOND [WANDERER] shalt thou be in the
earth.
16 And Cain WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD, and dwelt in the LAND
OF NOD [i.e. WANDER-LAND], on the EAST of Eden.
17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and HE
BUILDED A CITY, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
son, Enoch.

Don't miss the progression here:

1. Cain does not exercise faith. He does not DO WELL. He is unwilling to
trust God. He fails. He doesn't see the NEED to go to Abel to be blessed.
He perhaps blames God for a grievous commandment.

2. God warns him that his sinful discouragement, and neglect of repentance
will lead him to greater sin if it is not immediately dealt with.

3. Cain does not repent of his proud anger and unwillingness to trust God
in a certain area. God's prediction is fulfilled. Cain falls into greater
sin and murders his brother.

4. God judges Cain, and turns him over to be a WANDERER.

5. Cain dwells in WANDERLAND (Nod), out of fellowship with God and His
godly people.

6. Instead of repenting of his original sin, Cain involves himself in
building a CITY IN WANDERLAND! The land of wandering and eastern mystical,
feeling-oriented living, which amounts to NOTHING in the end. I suppose we
could call the disciples and withering fruit of such backsliders,
"NODITES"!

If you have sinned by not exercising faith in an area; if you have been
backsliding, if you will not confess your lack of faith, and repent, you
are going to begin TO HATE two types of people:

1. Those who DO exercise faith (2 Timothy 3:3).

2. Those who remind you that you should have taken a stand and exercised
faith:
 
1 John 3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
And wherefore slew he him? BECAUSE his own works were evil, and his
brother's righteous.
15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer....

People who go in the way of Cain often think God has been unfair. "Why
should I have to go to my brother for animals?" "My punishment is more
than I can bear":

Genesis 4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
can bear.

Therefore, they think that anyone who tells them to take responsibility
for their actions is PERSECUTING them. THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND:

Proverbs 14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to UNDERSTAND HIS WAY: but the
folly of fools IS DECEIT.
 
These backsliders just may spend the rest of their lives in self-pitying
bitterness, separated from the place of true service, out of true
fellowship with God. They will wander about with some great, WORTHLESS
project like building a city in NOD! Why? Because bitter backsliders need
to justify themselves:

Proverbs 28:13 He that COVERETH HIS SINS shall not prosper: but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

You can try to cover sin by hiding. But you can also try to cover it like
the Pharisees did, by intricate, religious zeal in a certain area. This is
what Cain did; it is the "way of Cain."

In conclusion, Cain sinned and backslid, and did not repent. He therefore
ended up in greater sin. And finally, he ended up a wanderer, out of
fellowship with God, and God's people.

The same thing happened to Jonah. Jonah backslid, and went:

1. Down to Joppa.
2. Down into the ship.
3. Down into the water.
4. Down into the belly of the whale.
5. Down into the bottom of the ocean.
6. Down into hell (Jonah 2:2).

The moral of the story is that it is easier to repent immediately after
the first sin or lack of faith. If you wait, you might still be able to
get back to where God wanted you to be - BUT IT WILL HAVE TO BE THROUGH A
WHALE'S BELLY.

The ROOT OF BITTERNESS does not come out easily (Hebrews 12:15). It
usually takes much time. How sad it is for so many to waste so much
valuable time in these last days, when they could be bringing forth TRUE,
LASTING fruit to God. Get out of WANDERLAND, dear backslider. If you do
not get out in this life, God has another DARK WANDERLAND waiting for you
during the Millennium (Matthew 25:30)!

There is NOTHING IN NOD! Oh, you may find some friends to join you in a
pity party in Nod. But it will not be truly satisfying. It will not bring
the true peace that comes from knowing you are in God's will:

Proverbs 14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways:
and a good man shall be SATISFIED FROM HIMSELF.

And perhaps we should conclude with a word to the wise believer, who so
far has remained planted in the house of God, and in the place of God's
will. If you intend to stay planted, and avoid the way of Cain, and the
way of the backslider, you must learn to AVOID FOOLISH, BITTER people!
This is how the whole section in Proverbs 14 begins:

Proverbs 14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
not in him the lips of knowledge.

It goes without saying that we need to stay out of the theater and junk
the TV. But we must also learn to go from the presence of Christian
brothers and sisters who begin to backbite or gossip, or murmur or
complain. And angry countenance will drive away a backbiting tongue
(Proverbs 25:23). And a foolish Christian who in bitterness, wishes to
tear down his or her own house (Proverbs 14:1), and the Lord's house (the
local church), MUST be disciplined before they DEFILE MANY with their
bitterness and immature tantrum (Hebrews 12:15). Simply walking away from
a complainer or griper, or showing an angry countenance to a backbiter,
might save them, and others they will defile, from YEARS of WANDERING IN
WANDERLAND. If not, it will certainly SAVE YOU from their folly, dear
Christian (Proverbs 14:7).

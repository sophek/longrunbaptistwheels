        <h1>82 PERCENT OF SCHOOLS FAIL? GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT!</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote>â€ The number of schools labeled as â€œfailingâ€ under the nationâ€™s No Child Left Behind Act could skyrocket dramatically this year, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Wednesday. The Department of Education estimates the percentage of schools not meeting yearly targets for their studentsâ€™ proficiency in math and reading could jump from 37 to 82 percent as states raise standards in attempts to satisfy the lawâ€™s mandates. The 2002 law requires states to set targets aimed at having all students proficient in math and reading by 2014, a standard now viewed as wildly unrealistic. â€˜No Child Left Behind is broken and we need to fix it now,â€ Duncan said in a statement. â€œThis law has created a thousand ways for schools to fail and very few ways to help them succeedâ€™â€¦â€ <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gPmjfDMN5nHOpeSIZYLwkVfKAHGQ?docId=c7dc0757afd54b5ca2836c00de44535f">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gPmjfDMN5nHOpeSIZYLwkVfKAHGQ?docId=c7dc0757afd54b5ca2836c00de44535f</a></blockquote>
Public schools do not need more tax money. They do not need the federal government. They need to close. Period. The whole nation was literate before this liberal, Unitarian, Humanist system of public education was instituted to make Catholic immigrants patriotic. The Catholics then protested the King James Bible in the classrooms, and then the Unitarians took off their masks and Humanism was born. Ever since 1930 (see Charles Potter), the Humanists have been laughing their heads off at how gullible Christians were to think that the only thing â€œwrongâ€ with public education was evolution. Home-schools, church schools and private schools are the answer to the problem of illiteracy, and anyone who HONESTLY wants to fix the problem will admit this. Remove all government entanglements from churches and private institutions, and you will have literacy rates sky-rocket in America. But the public school system is not REALLY about teaching anyone how to read and write. It is about training people to be mindless, passive socialists.

            THE MYSTICAL, CATHOLIC WAY TO UNITE ALL RELIGIONS (PT.1)
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
-Acts 16:30

The answer to Acts 16:30 from the coming new pagan, Evangelical, Catholic Bible Version will probably read like this: "Pray a prayer and invite Jesus into your heart and commit your life to Him right now. Of course, you must really mean it. You must not trust in just mere intellectual assent. It must be from your heart, not your head."

What a clever answer! What a perfect plan. What a way to not only bridge the gap between Catholics and Evangelicals; but all the religions of the world as well! In this system of salvation, one can actually have Catholic priests help with the altar calls. Not only that, but "new-age" eastern mystics would also probably help if they were invited. There is nothing about "believing" a truth. There is nothing about understanding any Bible facts. There is nothing mentioned about the fact that works cannot be the source or means of this salvation.

Notice how different this common answer is to the one given by Paul and Silas in the first century:

Acts 16:30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

"Believe." It does not say "work" or "invite." The above systems and traditions of man destroy absolute salvation assurance. What if one did not pray right? What if one did not ask Christ with the right words? Not only that, but what exactly is the "heart"? How does one know if Christ came into it? And if one is to "really mean it," but it can't be of the "head," then how does one know if one really meant it? To Hell quickly with such lies. It is obvious what will take place next. The deceived prospective convert will soon wonder if he did it right. He will most likely be told that he will "know" Jesus came in, when he sees himself being good and bringing forth fruit. He will be warned not to trust in his "prayer" for salvation, but to look to the fruit and see if he really meant the prayer.

Too often, nothing has happened to the man who responds to such a confused "invitation" but a "belly" dance; a wiggling around of his feelings. He has been emotionally affected before he starts his long road to working for salvation assurance.

Notice Paul and Silas said to "believe." What does that mean? Is it something other than "mere intellectual assent" of the head? Those who say that it is (though they ften mean well, and are afraid that people are only mouthing words) need to go back to Azuza street and put their "heads" in shoe-boxes and blank out their minds like they did then. Frank Bartleman describes the way some "experiences" manifested themselves in Los Angelos in the early 1900's:

"My mind, the last fortress of men to yield was truly taken possession of by the Spirit.."

Another agrees: "If I might add a word of caution from experience, it would be to use the greatest care to keep one's HEAD out of the way. It is not by way of one's head so much as by way of one's heart that the Holy Ghost loves to enter."
("Confidence," Dec., 1908, quoted by Lang, "The Earlier Years of the Modern Tongues Movement," Schoettle)

Occultism hates the intellectual mind! The devil wants to replace believing BIBLE FACTS (which requires the will of man to be willing to believe) with intuition and feelings:

"The mind is the great enemy..."
(Saranic witch, Aleister Crowley, "Magick," p.29)

"The formalized beginning and end of the (satanic) ceremony acts as a dogmatic, anti-intellectual device..."
("The Satanic Bible")

"The no-mind not thinks no-thoughts about nothings."
(Buddha, "Fuzzy Thinking," p.268)

Many wise Christians in history, such as Joseph Butler, powerfully cut out the "heart" of Deism in the 18th century. In that "Age of Reason," many had the idea that "reason" could fully function alone, unaided by the Bible. However, Butler responded by teaching in principle that men who's eyes could not see where it was dark, needed a flashlight. Yet, modern Christians under Satanic mystical delusion, started teaching that since man could not see in some areas; that such therefore proved man did not need eyes at all! Man should walk by the sense of touch! The subtle Serpent was no doubt behind this costly mistake. Notice Butler's argument in his famous Analogy:

"I express myself with caution, lest I should be mistaken to vilify reason, which is indeed the only faculty we have wherewith to judge concerning anything, even revelation itself..." (p.161)

"..but it is urged, as I hope it will be understood, with great caution of not vilifying the faculty of reason, which is the 'candle of the Lord within us', though it can afford no light where it does not shine: nor judge, where it has no principles to judge upon." (p. 252)

Therefore, man is not called to forsake his mind, or intellect. Man is called to understand, that without God's Revelation, man cannot "see" in many areas at all. Man is called to reason properly, upon true evidence; instead of making judgments upon presumptive passion and emotional prejudice. God does not tell man to get his "head" out of the way and walk by his "heart." In fact, "heart" simply refers to the inside. (Mtt.12:40) It therefore sometimes refers to many things that are found "inside" man. It could refer to the will, the intellect, or the feelings. However, if one is told to get his "head" out of the way; such leaves nothing but the "body" or "belly"! God never tells man to get his "head" out of the way. Yet, He does mean for man to get his "belly" out of the way, as far as it being the authority for the will. In other words, we are not to make judgments based upon feelings:

Isaiah 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

2 Thessalonians 3:2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.

1 Corinthians 2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.

Proverbs 20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.

Psalm 18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.

Romans 16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

Jude 1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.

It is obvious in Jude 1:10, that the Holy Spirit is contrasting a "brute" knowledge, with the intellectual kind."Brute" means "unreasonable." Therefore, Jude teaches that in the last days many would walk by "instinct," "appetites" and "passions," ungoverned by the rational mind enlightened by the written Word.

It is obvious that God does not desire that a man forsake his mind. God desires that a man let God enlighten his mind and strengthen it. The problem with man is not that he walks by reason, but that he is not reasonable enough! Even in this "eastern mystical" 20th century, some Christians have seen the light:

"The spirit is the seat of the intellectual being... Here the spirit of man is shown to be the seat of intelligence. It is by the spirit, man knows; it is the spirit that reasons. It is the spirit that receives instruction from God. The soul is the lower part... It is the seat of man's emotional nature. The natural man is therefore the soulish man."
- H.A. Ironside, Death and Afterwards (early part of this century)

"But they are natural men, physical, soul led men,...in whom the instinctive, appetitive soul is not governed by the Spirit... But then, this is connected also with the spirit of man, being once more in its proper place as the intelligent governor of emotions, affections, and appetites."
- F.W. Grant: (1902)

In returning to the response an unsaved man is to make to the Gospel, can it truly be said that it is possible for a person to have only a "head" knowledge? Can it be said that one has only "intellectually assented"? Such is absurdity to the fullest! If a person "assents" to a truth, it means that the person has fully believed the fact with his will. He has "heard" the evidence. He has "judged" upon it. And with the "will," he has come to his belief of the declaration, as being true or false:

Acts 24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

If a man believes that Jesus Christ, according to the Scriptures, is the Saviour for his sins, the man is saved. "Belief" is of the intellectual mind, accepting with the will, the truth of a proposition. One is not called to believe with one's foot or belly button:

John 20:31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

One is called to "believe" a "that." The "that" is a "fact." If one believes the fact, one is saved and given life.

But do not the devils "believe and tremble"? (Jms.2:19) The point in that Scripture is that belief alone will not save a Christian at the Judgment Seat! James is not talking about salvation into eternity, which is free by faith alone.(Jn.3:16, Tit.3:5) James is talking about how a Christian may stand approved at the Judgment Seat of Christ; which is through faith and patience. (Heb.6:12, Jms.1:4, 2:24) It is insane to teach that James is telling "professing" Christians that "mental assent" is not a true, saving "belief."

Therefore, when Scripture tells the unsaved to believe in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins; it means exactly that. However, Peter , like James, tells those already saved to add to their faith, obedience. If true "belief" was some kind of works or "commitment to obey", Peter would not have to say to add these extra things to it for reward. (2 Pet.1:5-7)

But do not many "professing" Christians have only a "head" knowledge? What does one want them to have, an "elbow" knowledge? Does one want them to speak in strange babble, laugh for no reason, or perhaps bark like dogs? (Azuza, and Toronto)

Imagine a man attempting with his "head" to argue that "head" knowledge is evil! (It would be like a country threatening to lose a war on purpose if the other side did not let them win.)

If what one means is that many that believe that Jesus Christ died on the Cross for their sins, do not appear to be "fired up" in obedience to the New Testament commands, the fault must largely lie in the watered-down doctrine of reward taught by most modern preachers. Obedience after belief, is for reward. If one who has believed the Gospel, appears to be living in sloth, it only shows that the person is in much danger at Christ's Second Coming. (2Cor.5:9-11)

In an effort to bring in this "eastern mystical," Catholic seduction, many are recklessly lumping many different things into the same pot. Many who are labeled by modern apostates as having only a "mere intellectual assent," actually do not possess any assurance of salvation in eternity. Many of these still hope to merit salvation by being "good" according to their own definition of "goodness." Many of these have never even heard the true Gospel, much less, understood it as being true. The right facts must be truly believed. Believing there is a God, is not the same as believing the fact that Jesus gave His life for one's sins. Therefore it is not by asking, feeling, praying, working, or hoping. It is by believing the fact of John.3:16. Many respond by saying: "I think a person who is intellectually believing in facts, should examine himself to see if he is really saved. True Biblical belief is not just believing a set of facts." Really? Actually the people advocating such confusion from the belly of Buddha, ought to examine themselves according to John 3:16 to see what exactly they "believed" when they supposedly were saved. If "belief" is not believing with the rational mind, there is nothing left but "feelings." It sounds like these people made a deal with God to be good and work for salvation assurance by being committed to obedience like good Catholics. "No, we are saying that belief is of the mind, but it isn't just mere intellectual assent to a set of facts." What facts? You mean believing that the Bible is the Word of God, and that God became a man to die for the guilt of sins, and that one may live in eternity by this free gift to the world? It's not by believing those facts?

Intellectual:
- Ideal; perceived by the intellect, not the senses. (Johnson's Dictionary 1755)
-Relating to the intellect or understanding, belonging to the mind. (Webster's 1956)

Assent:
-To concede; to yield to, or agree to:
"And the Jews also assented, saying, that these things were so." Bible, Acts, xxiv. 9 (Johnson's Dictionary 1755)
- The act of the mind in admitting, or agreeing to, the truth of a proposition.
"Faith is the assent to any proposition, on the credit of the proposer." Locke. (Webster's 1828)

Mere:
- This or that only; distinct from anything else. Absolute, entire. (Webster's 1828)

On the authority of the Word of God and the English language, Salvation is by the love and grace of God given in Jesus Christ's life and death to man, through mere intellectual assent of the truth of it. (Jn.3:16, 20:31)

Doesn't one have to "pray" a "hearty" prayer? This may accompany salvation as an after response. But salvation is through faith.

Many have been confused because they know that the "will" must be involved in accepting the Gospel. Yet, such have obviously been deceived by liberal, humanistic, modern philosophy which teaches that a person can "believe" something without the will being involved. (For an excellent discussion of this see Rationalism, Empiricism and Idealism, J.A. Passmore, p.23, Claredon Press, Oxford) Therefore, to compensate for the lack of the will in their humanistic definition of "belief," such have added "invite" to the call of the Gospel. This keeps everything subjective, and allows Catholics and evangelicals to cooperate together at the expense of Scripture truth.

The Mystical, Catholic Way to Unite All Religions (pt.2)

"Being a good person will not save you. Nor will BELIEVING in Jesus. You already believe. Believing is only the first step... To be saved from hell you must bring Jesus into your heart. Listen with your heart as Jesus speaks the following words to you from the Bible. 'Behold I stand at the door (of your heart) and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him.' If you'll say and mean this 'SPECIAL PRAYER' you'll go to heaven..."
(Christ For The Nations Institute, Gospel tract)

There is a strange phenomena present in modern Christianity. Whenever a well known preacher or teacher gives his ending call to "salvation," and one hears: "Now invite Jesus into your heart, pray this prayer, and commit your life to Him," one also finds that these same preachers are nine times out of ten compromised with Catholicism. They are writings books praising Pope John Paul II as a good Christian or "evangelist."

Actually it is not "strange" at all. This new "altar call" destroys absolute, certain assurance. And "assurance" is the main "bone of contention" between true Bible believers and other corrupt denominations, like Catholicism, etc. The testimonies abound of true Christians that "believed" who were later thrown into bondage by this ecumenical, eastern mystical mode of presenting salvation. In fact, whenever this "call" is given, you will find thousands, no doubt secretly inviting Christ again and again, hoping it will stick this time! They are making sure they said the right words and really "meant it."

This new method of supposedly presenting the Gospel, as we have seen, was not used once by Peter, Paul, or any Apostle in the Book of Acts. It will not be found in Scripture. It is a product of a slow seduction that is the key to uniting Catholics, Evangelical, Baptists, Charismatics, and "New Agers," into one big "Theosophical," Gnostic, Hippie "experience":

Luke 23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

Now that the West has been corrupted by Eastern thinking; and truth, reason, and wisdom have been turned into something sensual, mystical, foolish and idiotic, many that were at "enmity" are now "gathered together." All are in unity against an absolutely perfect Bible, intellectual thinking, and absolute assurance that goes with such things.

It is an acceptance of Jesus, but He is redefined into their mystical puppet, who must only communicate by passion, impression, fuzzy voices, imaginations, nice feelings, etc. (which of course means that Jesus "says" whatever such people desire Him to say in their "heart").

Yet, we have studied these foundations in part 1 of this study. Let us now go on to answer some of the favorite Bible passages used to supposedly bring someone to Christ in this mystical, vague, unsure way. Remember the clear way given in Acts 16:30-31 as well as the rest of Scripture on how to get saved is to "believe."

Perhaps the most common passage of Scripture used to urge unbelievers to "ask Christ into their heart" is found in Christ's words to His own people, already saved. This was the text used by Christ for the Nations in their heretical tract. This is found in the Epistles to the Seven Churches in the Book of Revelation:

Revelation 3: 14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

No unbeliever in this Scripture is being told to ask or invite Jesus into their wicked heart for supper and "fellowship"! (2Cor.6:14-16) The "any man" is a reference to "any true Christian." The voice of Christ is the voice of His written Word, and in a secondary sense, it is the voice of wisdom, reason and truth through enlightened conscience:

Proverbs 2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.

This means that God wills to reason with His backslidden people in these last days. Christ is "knocking." This means He is trying to get the attention of His people to see that their day of judgment is at hand. When a Christian "opens the door," it means He believes the Lord and obeys Him through His power and grace:

James 5: 8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

This teaching to Laodicea, shows us that in the last days the Lord will revive His truth to His seeking people about the partial, Firstfruits rapture and the reality that a carnal Christian may miss the 1000 year Kingdom. He will give His seeking people the knowledge of a perfect Word (KJV) to back up that teaching. If a Christian believes it, he will move with fear as Noah, and "open the door." (S.O.S. 5:2) The fear is the beginning of wisdom, the instrument of grace to transform the believer's life so he may stand approved on that day:

Hebrews 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

This verse about Noah teaches, not how to get saved in eternity by imputed righteousness, but how the Christian may be saved at the Judgment Seat of Christ by practical righteousness working by fear and faith in God's warnings. Although the obedient believer will experience fellowship in the practical righteousness of Christ; the fullness of promise to those obedient in Laodicea is future, referring to the Millennial blessing:

Luke 12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;
36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.

Therefore, it is pure vanity and self-deceived hypocrisy to write this Scripture to Laodicea off to the unsaved, unbelievers! It has nothing to do with them. Neither is Christ telling people to "open the door" by falling down in trances and speaking in strange babble. It doesn't mean "shut off your mind." If you as a Christian desire true fellowship "together" with your Lord, then obey Him and do what He says:

Isaiah 1: 17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

Salvation in eternity cannot be lost. Yet, the reward of the firstfruits rapture as well as the 1000 year Kingdom may be forfeited. This is the teaching the Lord gives His people who find themselves in the same state as Laodicea. It is a dangerous nonsense that is taught today by modern Baptists and Evangelicals as they try to stand against Rome and the New Age, while at the same time leaving the window wide open, pretending Jesus likes to climb through that way. (John 10:1)

The wisdom and truth of an earlier age is indeed refreshing and sober compared to the deceptions and double-tongued schemes so rampant today. The following men heard the real voice and knock of Revelation 3 and were therefore instruments by which the Lord Himself "knocked" on the door of the churches:

Robert Govett: (1813-1901)
"At this point I have to correct an error, which runs through all the commentaries on this epistle, which I have seen... The churches addressed by Christ were assemblies of believers: and therefore, converted men... It throws us therefore, on a wrong track, to speak of this (Laodicea) and Sardis, as the 'professing church' or 'Christendom'... This is not, as it is usually regarded the Saviour's call to the unconverted. Jesus displays His grace to his backslidden people... He represents himself as one attempting to obtain an entrance at a friends house."
(Commentary on Revelation, Conley & Schoettle Pub.)

D.M. Panton: (1912)
"Sardis and Laodicea, for example, are laid on God's operating table: They are cauterized to the bone: but they can recover...For the Angel of Sardis and Laodicea no award would have been possible except sharp censure at the Judgment Seat... My beloved brethren who differ with me have got an awkward dilemma before them. The majority of them acknowledge that these Epistles are for the churches of Christ through the ages, but the moment we come to apply the passages we are told that one half of those passages do not apply. That is an awkward dilemma. I have no conception how they will escape."
(Papers read before the Prophecy Investigation Society, 1912)

G.H. Pember: (1887)
"Perhaps the knocking may refer to two different means, which the Lord is using to rouse His people. The first of them is probably, chastisement;... For while He is breaking in pieces their earthly rest, He has not forgotten to set that glorious hope before them... and power has been given to those who seek it to understand the great prophetic utterances of God, which have for centuries lain sealed and comparatively unnoticed... Few there may be who will listen to these words, but the great multitude of the Laodiceans, have no desire to sup with the Lord... And so, they permit the fear of any slight inconvenience to deter them from rising to open unto their Lord, until at last, His hand is seen through the hole of the door, until He manifests His presence by the rapture of those who are looking for Him."
(Vol.4. The Great Prophecies, Conley & Schoettle Pub.)

Revelation 3:20 has nothing to do with getting any unbeliever saved. It is a call to true Christians to wake up and get ready! If you do not heed this call Christian, the Tribulation Period may be the next "knock" you hear. If you heed not that one, you will miss the Millennial Kingdom.

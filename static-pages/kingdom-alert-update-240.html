***************************************************
FORNICATION NATION: ANCIENT GREECE REVIVED
***************************************************
1 Thessalonians 4:1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort
you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk
and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.
2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should
ABSTAIN from fornication:
4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour;
5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, EVEN AS THE GENTILES which know not
God:
6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because
that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you
and testified.
7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

We should "abound more and more" in holiness. We should not be stagnant.
To be fixed in regard to holiness, means to be fixed in a way that a tree
is fixed! It has deep roots. It is not easily shaken with the winds of
temptation. It is not easily moved in the storms of life. But although it
is fixed and established, it is not lifeless and stagnant. It is growing
toward the sun!:

1 Corinthians 15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast,
UNMOVEABLE, always ABOUNDING in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know
that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

These two things are often found together in Scripture. The man who is
rooted and planted and established and fixed IN THE LORD'S WILL, is the
man who is ABOUNDING and FLOURISHING:

Colossians 2:7 ROOTED and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as
ye have been taught, ABOUNDING therein with thanksgiving.

Psalms 92:13 Those that BE PLANTED in the house of the LORD shall FLOURISH
in the courts of our God.

Proverbs 14:11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
tabernacle of the upright shall FLOURISH.

God wants you to be where you should be in body, soul and spirit; and we
know we are where we need to be because we can feel the growing pains! We
can feel the challenge. So, as a plant that is deep rooted, and in the
sun, will flourish, so should we walk in the light of the Lord's Word.

In verse 2 of  1 Thessalonians 4, Paul reminds them that they already know
what commandments they have been given by Jesus. And he goes on to remind
them of one of the MAIN commandments Christian GENTILES need to hear!:

1 Thessalonians 4:3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification,
that ye should ABSTAIN FROM FORNICATION:
4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour;
5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, EVEN AS THE GENTILES which know not
God:

"Concupiscence" means "any unlawful lust or desire." Paul is at this point
going directly against MANY CENTURIES of Gentile culture and custom! If it
could ever be said, "But everybody does it," it could certainly be said so
of fornication at that time! Thessalonica was in Greece:

"Thessalonica: Ancient name for Salonica, a Greek seaport on the Aegean
Sea. St. Paul's epistles to the Thessalonians were addressed to the
Christians in this city."
(Grolier Encyclopedia)

These ancient Gentiles were "accustomed" to idolatry and fornication:

1 Corinthians 12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these
dumb idols, even as ye were led.

1 Corinthians 6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?
shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of AN
HARLOT? God forbid.
16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for
two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
18 FLEE FORNICATION. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but
he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which
is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

The Grecians had been fornicators for centuries:

"Even the greatest of heathen moralists, Socrates, instructed a harlot how
she should conduct her shameful business. The heathen moralists condemned
unchastity only in the case of a childbearing wife, as it would wrong her
husband not to know the paternity of her children."
("People's NT Com.")

Let us notice some of the history of the ancient Greeks and we can begin
to see what many are trying to "bless" us with today!:

Sparta (the military state):

"...not only must every child face the father's right to infanticide, but
it must also be brought before a state council of inspectors; and any
child that appeared defective was thrown from a cliff...Husbands were
encouraged to lend [out] their wives...so fine children might be
multiplied....At the age of seven the Spartan boy was taken from his
family and brought up by the state [in a rigorous military regiment]....At
twelve the boy was deprived of underclothing, and was allowed but one
garment throughout the year....he did not bathe frequently....he slept in
the open...Until he was thirty he lived with his company in barracks, and
knew none of the comforts of home....He was taught, in preparation for
war, to forage in the fields and find his own food, or starve....The girl,
though left to be brought up at home, was also subject to regulation by
the state...She [must] go naked in public dances and processions...so that
she might be stimulated [or shamed] into the proper care of her
body....NEARLY EVERY LAD HAD A LOVER AMONG OLDER MEN...[until he married a
women at age thirty]. Celibacy in Sparta was a crime....Spartan women,
says Plutarch, 'were bold and masculine, overbearing to their
husbands...'....if a man's belly swelled indecently he might be publicly
reproved by the government....[This] Spartan code produced good soldiers
and nothing more....When she fell, all nations marveled, but none mourned.
Today, among the scanty ruins of that ancient capital, hardly a torso or a
fallen pillar survives to declare that here there once lived Greeks."
(Will Durant, "The Life of Greece," 1939)

They were shocked when Sparta fell. But the men had become effeminate and
perverted, against nature. This is the "culture" people want to bring to
us today. In many ways, it is certainly already upon us. The military
fornicators exposed in Iraq are a symptom of our Hollywood-addicted
culture back home. A nation of fornicators can be CONTROLLED by
manipulators. But it is a WEAK society. It will crumble. Let us now move
on to notice the state of Corinth:

Corinth:

"Courtesans [prostitutes] were so numerous in the city that the Greeks
often used 'corinthiazomai' as signifying harlotry....The Temple of
Aphrodite,' says Strabo, 'was so rich that it owned more than a thousand
temple slaves, courtesans [prostitutes] whom both men and women had
dedicated to the goddess. And therefore it was on account of these women
that the city was crowded with people and grew rich; for instance, the
ship captains freely squandered there money here.'"
(Will Durant, "The Life of Greece," 1939)

Athens:

"Premarital chastity is required of respectable women, but among unmarried
men...there are few moral restraints upon desire....No stigma is attached
to the occasional intercourse of young men with courtesans; even married
men may patronize them without any greater penalty than a scolding at home
and a slightly tarnished reputation in the city...The lowest order [of
harlots was the] pornai...in common brothels...Higher than these
girls...are the auletrides, or flute-players, who...assist at 'stag'
entertainments, provide music and gaiety, perform dances...[etc.]...The
highest class of Greek courtesans is composed of the hetairai -
[hi-ter'-ah] literally companions....the hetairai are usually women of the
citizen class, who have fallen from respectability...they live
independently, and entertain at their own homes....they dye their hair
yellow....The chief rivals of the hetairai are the boys of Athens....When
Plato...talks of human love, he means homosexual love....[and most of the
courtesans are homosexual].....Besides his wife a man may take a
concubine. 'We have courtesans for the sake of pleasure,' says
Demosthenes, 'concubines for the daily health of our bodies, and wives to
bear us lawful offspring and be the faithful guardians of our homes.' here
in one startling sentence is the Greek view of woman in the classic
age....The law makes adultery by woman, or by a man with a married woman,
punishable with death, but the Greeks are too lenient to concupiscence to
enforce this statute. The injured husband is usually left to deal with the
adulterer as he will and can....For the man divorce is simple; he may
simply dismiss his wife at any time, without stating the cause....the
children [always, regardless of the cause of divorce] remain with the
man...."
(Will Durant, "The Life of Greece," 1939)

There you have it. And Paul warned us that PERILOUS TIMES were coming (2
Timothy 3:1).

Certainly, in these modern times, families are disintegrating and
testimonies are being ruined by adultery and fornication. We are commanded
to FLEE this sin (and everything that makes provision for it):

ABSTAIN BY FLEEING!

1 Thessalonians 4:3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification,
that ye should abstain from fornication:

1 Peter 2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

1 Corinthians 6:18 FLEE fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without
the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

2 Timothy 2:20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and
of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to
dishonour.
21 If a man therefore purge himself FROM THESE, he shall be a vessel unto
honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every
good work.
22 FLEE also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity,
peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

We are to purge ourselves from certain PEOPLE (vessels of dishnour). How
can we do this when we bring them into our living rooms by worldly media
and entertainment?

To "flee" means to RUN, like a deer runs from a hunter:

Proverbs 6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter...

We need to ESCAPE. That means UNPLUG THE ANTENNA. Escape from STRANGE
WOMEN on the screen (or in person):

Ecclesiastes 7:26 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart
is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall
ESCAPE FROM HER; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

We need to run like Joseph!:

Genesis 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and
he left his garment in her hand, and FLED, and got him out.

Proverbs 5:8 REMOVE THY WAY FAR FROM HER, and come not nigh the door of
her house:

Proverbs 7:7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
youths, a young man void of understanding,
8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went THE WAY to her
house,
9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and
subtil of heart.
11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
22 He GOETH AFTER HER straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as
a fool to the correction of the stocks;

We can survive in the midst of a perverse world only by guarding our
hearts and eyes and taking prudent precautions to protect our families. I
recently met a young Christian couple on the street. They said that they
do not have a television. I asked them why. They said, "You can hardly
watch the commercials without sinning today." They said they could feel
the Holy Ghost leading them to get rid of it. They said some other couples
also took a stand, and they all smashed their TV's like the people in Acts
who burned their evil books. Therefore, the Lord is raising up a remnant
that is seeking after purity and holiness. There are others that are
tolerating and excusing an increasing amount of filth. They are giving
people their money to put a "form of godliness" on their filth. But it is
still ungodly. Flee this filth before the Lord kills you. Flee before your
family gets filled with Sodom. Lot left Sodom too late. He could get out
of Sodom, but he couldn't get Sodom out of his daughters. Think about it.

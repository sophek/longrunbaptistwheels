        <h1>DEAD BIRDS AND FISH: THE LORD HAS A CONTROVERSY</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Hosea 4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
3 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
Regardless of the instrumental cause, the Lord is in control of all things. There is no truth, no mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land today. There is swearing and lying and killing (especially the unborn) and stealing and adultery. It is time to repent and turn to the God of the Holy Bible.

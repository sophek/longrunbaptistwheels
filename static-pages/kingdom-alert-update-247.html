CHILDREN AND THE COIN OF COVETOUSNESS (Sermon by Joey Faust)
******************************************************************

TEXT: Luke 18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the
kingdom of God as a LITTLE CHILD shall in no wise ENTER therein.
18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?
23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly
shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
 
Mark 10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
answereth again, and saith unto them, CHILDREN, how hard is it for them
that trust in riches to ENTER into the kingdom of God!

There are six commandments of the Ten, that concern our duty towards men.
Jesus mentions all but one of these. He purposely omits the command
against covetousness, for the moment. This man was guilty of this sin of
covetousness. Let us define this sin:

Covetousness:
"Inordinately eager to acquire and possess, especially by unjust or
unlawful meansâ€¦avaricious [i.e. eager to accumulate and hoardâ€¦grasping.]"
(Standard Dictionary, 1895)

There are two simple, though deadly, dangers in regard to riches:

1. To sin in order to OBTAIN them.
2. To sin in order to KEEP them.

It is covetousness, the tenth commandment, that relates to both of these
dangers:

Exodus 20:17 Thou shalt not covetâ€¦

The man who wants to possess more, who is not contented, who will sin and
compromise to obtain wealth, is covetous:

1 Timothy 6:6 But godliness with CONTENTMENT is great gain.
7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
nothing out.
8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
9 But THEY THAT WILL BE RICH fall into temptation and a snare, and into
many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
perdition.
10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which WHILE SOME COVETED
AFTER, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with
many sorrows.

In the same manner, the man who is already wealthy, but who is only
concerned with building bigger barns, and does not consider the needs of
the Gospel and his fellow men, is also covetous.

Greed often causes the poor man to seek after wealth in a sinful manner.
Greed ften causes the rich man to grasp and hoard his wealth in a sinful
manner. The rich young ruler clutched his riches, even in the very face of
Jesus Christ correcting him! The money had made him stubborn, and
obstinate to the will of God.

Riches can deceive the covetous man, and cause him to forget that God
judges our giving on the basis of not what we HAVE done, but on what we
COULD have done!:

Luke 21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
the treasury.
2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath CAST
IN MORE than they all:
4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God:
but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.

Giving is measured, not so much by amount, but by the PAIN. The Lord is
not saying that God only notices offering from poorer people. The rich men
could have given just as much as the widow. They could have made it HURT
just as much. But they did not. And this explains our Lordâ€™s warning to
His disciples here in Luke 18:

Luke 18:24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

Why was the poor widow willing to give so much? Perhaps she felt she
didnâ€™t have much to lose, and since she has already lost so much IN THIS
WORLD, she might as well invest in the NEXT world (i.e. the Millennial
Kingdom)! But how easy is it for people who already have so much HERE, to
be willing to invest in the next world? It is very difficult says the
Lord. Without Godâ€™s grace, it is actually impossible:

Mark 4:19 And the cares of this world, and THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES,
and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
unfruitful.

Why are riches "deceitful"? Because they dull the mind in regard to TIME.
They can make us feel immortal, and we forget that the future is the grave
and the judgment:

1 Timothy 6:7 For we brought nothing into this world, and IT IS CERTAIN we
can carry nothing out.
17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded,
nor trust in UNCERTAIN RICHES, but in the living God, who giveth us richly
all things to enjoy;
18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
distribute, willing to communicate;
19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against THE TIME TO
COME, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

Indeed, if we disperse our funds now, before we die, we shall know for
sure that the funds are spent to the glory of God. But if we wait, Solomon
says we will not know whether the person who uses our funds after us will
be a wise man or a fool. But the rich young ruler could not let go, and
this is the grave danger of prosperity. We become drunk with it, and we
begin to reason like drunkards:

"He had great riches, and men and women were living in poverty all about
him; yet he continued to go on as he was and did not realize that God had
entrusted him with this wealth that he might use it for Himâ€¦.There will be
no one in that day who will look back and say, 'I wish I had been more
self-centered; I wish I had not been so devoted; I wish I had not yielded
so much to Jesus Christ.' There will be no one who will speak like that in
the coming day." (Ironside, 1947)

Luke 12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and BEWARE OF COVETOUSNESS:
for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth.

Beware of the covetousness that would sinfully seek to obtain riches in
the first place. And beware of the covetousness which would seek to
clutch, grasp and hoard these riches, once they are acquired:

Ecclesiastes 5:10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with
silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

So, I repeat, there are these two sides of the COIN OF COVETOUSNESS. One
side is for people who do not yet possess earthly riches, who will sin and
compromise to increase their status (Proverbs 30:8-9). And the other is
for those who already possess riches, who will forget God, and sin and
compromise to KEEP their status.

One side of the sin is pictured by the man who wanted Jesus to rebuke his
brother and obtain his brotherâ€™s inheritance. Perhaps he thought his
father had not been fair. If he was not willing to steal to obtain this
inheritance, he was certainly willing to be distracted by seeking it. It
is also seen in Elisha's servant:

2 Kings 5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his
hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after
him, and take somewhat of him.
22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even
now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of
the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes
of garments.
[Elisha then said] 27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto
thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
leper as white as snow.

And of course, the other side of the coin, sinning or compromising to KEEP
riches, is what is presented before us in the rich young ruler. Even with
Jesus standing before him, his riches were still able to blind him! Surely
the Devil had prepared him for this evil day. Perhaps it was through a
series of little compromises that the rich young ruler was found
unprepared for the great day of decision. He went away trying to lick his
wounds with rationalizations and justifications. But Jesus said the man
was on his way to missing the coming Kingdom. Jesus warned us all that we
had best be careful about entangling ourselves in the cares of this world.
It might be impossible to detangle ourselves, if and when, we find
ourselves in the valley of decision!:

"â€¦the principle of God's government is paternal; and therefore its primary
object is the development in us of the character of DEAR CHILDREN, the
essential feature of which is unlimited dependenceâ€¦.The danger of riches
is their being trusted in; and the difficulty of possessing them, and not
trusting in them for happiness and protection, is as the difficulty of a
camel's going through the eye of a needle: therefore, 'lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth, for where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.'"
(Anthony Norris Groves, "Christian Devotedness," 1829) 

And this is where it all comes together: What are we going to TRUST? Will
be as dear children of God, and trust HIM, or will we trust in the riches
of this world?:

Mark 10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
answereth again, and saith unto them, CHILDREN, how hard is it for them
that TRUST IN RICHES to enter into the kingdom of God!

It does not matter which side of the coin of covetousness you are on. You
must trust God.

But there is only way to manifest whether you will trust God, and that is
to be TESTED. God wants us to respond to our testing with the child-like
faith that says, "I will trust God to supply my every need, and I will do
what is RIGHT in this matter."

But covetousness is idolatry:

Colossians 3:5â€¦covetousness, which is idolatry:

Why? Because it places the trust in riches or Mammon, that should be
placed in God:

Luke 16:13â€¦Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
14 And the Pharisees also, who were COVETOUS, heard all these things: and
they derided him.
15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselvesâ€¦

In other words, a person says, "I MUST sin and compromise God's standards
and commandments. How will I eat or be clothed? I MUST do this to survive.
Without the Manna of Mammon, I will starve."

It is clinging to, and trusting in, something earthly to supply our needs.
And we will always know what we are SINFULLY trusting suc things BY THE
DECISIONS WE MAKE when we are tested to make a choice! The decisions will
MANIFEST our allegiance. They prove our faith outwardly (before men). They
show WHERE it lies.

On the other side of the coin of covetousness is the man who has riches.
He is not usually tested on what he will do to obtain them, but on what he
will do to keep them. In a test such as the rich young ruler had, he says,
"I do not know what I would do with a lower standard of living! To beg I
am ashamed. I cannot live by faith in God. I would lose my mind! I will do
whatever is necessary to keep my present standard of living."

Thus, his faith is in his Mammon. He refuses to trust God.

In either case, regardless of which side of the coin they are on, both are
filled with amazement. They panic. They do not have child-like faith that
rests confidently and quietly in God and HIS provision:

2 Corinthians 9:8 And GOD IS ABLE to make all grace abound toward you;
that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every
good work:
  
We should not be afraid to give. In the same way, we should not be afraid
to OBEY. Step out onto the water. Don't look at the waves. Don't say, "I
HAVE to sin! I must lean on money! What would I do without it? How shall I
then live?"

Matthew 6:24 â€¦Ye CANNOT serve God and mammon.
25 Therefore I say unto you, TAKE NO THOUGHT for your life, what ye shall
eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put onâ€¦.
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is,
and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O
YE OF LITTLE FAITH?
31 Therefore TAKE NO THOUGHT, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly
Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33 But SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD, AND HIS TIGHTEOUSNESS; and all
these things shall be added unto you.
 
Notice what the phrase "take thought" means in the King's English:

Take Thought: "Anxiety or distress of mind...grief, sorrow, trouble, care,
vexation. 'To take thought': to trouble oneself, grieve, or be
distressedâ€¦'Soto died of THOUGHT in Florida.' (1613)â€¦" (Oxford Dictionary)

This is a promise that if we put reigning in God's Kingdom and walking in
His righteousness as our chief priority, God will take care of us. The
rich young ruler, if he had had faith to enter the Kingdom, would have
said, "The Lord can take care of me with or without my riches. I will
trust in Him, not Mammon. I will obey Him in every detail. I will not miss
the Kingdom for idolatry!"

But too often people get worried. They get anxious. They get amazed and
stressed. And then they panic and COMPROMISE. They cannot let go and trust
God:

Hebrews 13:5 Let your conversation be WITHOUT COVETOUSNESS; and be content
with such things as ye have: for HE HATH SAID, I WILL NEVER LEAVE THEE,
NOR FORSAKE THEE.
6 So that we may boldly say, THE LORD IS MY HELPER, and I will not fear
what man shall do unto me.
7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the
word of God: whose faith followâ€¦

The rich young ruler could not boldy say and demonstrate before men that
the Lord was his helper. By his actions, he confessed that the false god
of Mammon was his helper. And Mammon is a false god, because when a person
takes his last breath, Mammon will leave the soul NAKED. Its vain promise
of perpetual provision is only deceit. It is a fantasy for the covetous,
who may choose to plan for retirement, but will not plan for after death.

What commands are you willing to ignore for earthly comfort? When we break
the Lord's commandments for money, we are not seeking "His righteousness"
first in our lives. The Lord did not say, "Seek ye first a high standard
of livingâ€¦" Do you demonstrate before your children or friends that God's
church and His holiness come before maintaining a certain standard of
living? At what point will you forsake the assembling on the Lord's Day?
What sins will you participate in to keep your job? We need to manifest
the faith of Moses, who despised the treasures of Egypt. We need the faith
of Daniel's three friends, who were willing to go the whole way into the
fiery furnace to keep the holy standards of God. And the Lord did not meet
them UNTIL THEY WENT IN! And often the Lord will not sustain you and
provide for your every need, UNTIL WE STEP OUT ON FAITH; until we walk in
the obedience of faith and say, "I will not fear what man will do unto me.
I will not fear living by faith. My God will provide." There are thousands
of Christian families ordering their homes in a godly manner, according to
Titus 2, who are experiencing God's miraculous provision. The world, and
worldly Christians may be scorning, but they are living by faith and
enjoying God's presence and provision. Husbands, you must indeed provide
for your family, or be worse than an infidel. But you are never commanded
to provide for them by sinning and by compromise! When we compromise to
provide for our families (remember the Israelites when they heard the
report of the spies?), we purchase to ourselves God's curses. Let us seek
the blessing of the Lord. He adds no sorrow with it. It is the blessing
that comes from standing on the promises! It is God meeting with us in the
fiery furnace. It is the happiness that comes when we "trust and obey."
But the rich ruler went away SORROWFUL, tormented with guilt, vexed in his
conscience, clutching his Mammon-god, that cannot speak or hear, or
comfort him when he dies a naked soul.

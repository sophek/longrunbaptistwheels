            THE NEW BETTY FRIEDAN?: THE BIBLICAL VIEW OF PALIN POWER

"Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America, but it turns out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all."
(Sarah Palin, VP acceptance speech)

"'Superwoman is a myth' say modern women because 'family life suffers with working mums' - The supermum who holds down a demanding career while running the family home is falling out of favour, a high-powered academic report said yesterday. Most people believe that the march of mothers into work has been harmful for family life, it found. Instead, there is 'growing sympathy for the old-fashioned view that a woman's place is in the home rather than in the office'...'Opinions are shifting as the shine of the 'supermum' syndrome wears off, and the idea of women juggling high-powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals.' Nicola Horlick, who combined a City career with raising a family of six in the 1990s, is often hailed as the archetypal supermum. However her marriage crumbled and she divorced in 2003. She later said: 'Maybe the answer is you can't necessarily have a happy marriage if you end up being a very high-powered woman'...The report, carried out by Cambridge University, will add to controversy over Labour's push to persuade all mothers of young children to go out to work...Professor Jacqueline Scott compared studies of attitudes to working mothers over the past 25 years and found that disillusionment has been escalating since the mid-1990s. Now only a minority of those in Britain believe that family life does not suffer when a woman works full-time...there is clear evidence that women's changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family."
(Daily Mail, Aug. 6, 2008)

Proverbs 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

Isaiah 3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

What is the Biblical view of Sarah Palin? It appears than whenever there is a return of mothers back to their homes and children, there is an opposing, defensive measure set up by the unseen "powers that be." The return of mothers in the 1950's, in America, was quickly counteracted by the financing and publishing of Betty Friedan's, The Feminine Mystique, where she pretended that she was a common housewife who had grown miserable by housework, and called for women to abandon their homes for "fulfilling" careers (she was really a Communist activist). Today, we are in the midst of another exodus from the workplace by mothers with natural affection for their little ones. It is therefore not surprising that Sarah Palin has suddenly appeared as the new role model for conservative and Christian women.

One of the greatest problems in this age is the sad neglect of the Holy Scriptures, even among God's people. Too many Christians are largely unaware how their worldview is shaped by skillful propaganda. A little study of the devious methods of Edward Bernays might open some eyes to how easily marketing has changed many of our lives. The infamous humanist, Charles Potter, once boasted in 1930 that Christians were powerless to stop the rise of humanism, since their own children were getting only one hour a week of church, contrasted to five days a week of humanist propaganda in public schools. He argued that within a few decades every church in America would have to embrace humanism just to keep its doors open. One of the main pillars of humanistic philosophy is to lean to one's own reasoning or feelings apart from God's Scriptures. Today, decades after Potter's boast, many modern Christians eat and drink the world to such a degree that they do not even realize how much their minds have been increasingly diverted away from God's truths (1 Corinthians 15:33). What will many modern Christians not embrace for political expediency? It is no secret that much of Evangelical Christianity is enchanted with Sarah Palin. The editor of Charisma Magazine likens her to a Biblical prophet. Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily has endorsed her for president. But is this fascination justified? Or is this blanket approval another warning sign that humanism has infected much of modern Christianity?

Satan hardly ever takes great steps forward in his agenda without giving up a little ground that he knows he can regain later. In some ways, at first glance, the situation concerning Sarah Palin appears devastating to the Devil's ultimate agenda. For many years, female politicians have tried to manifest masculine power (e.g., "A Look Back at Hillary's Year in Pantsuits," Glamour Magazine). And since they are women, this attempt to portray masculine power appears far from "comely" (1 Corinthians 11:13). For many men, it is downright offensive. There are three earthly powers a woman may utilize. She may attempt to exude masculine power (Deuteronomy 22:5); or she may walk in harlot power (Proverbs 7:10, 21); or she may utilize her natural, feminine power.

A woman's God-given feminine power is a quality that will rejoice the heart of men, and go far in influencing them (1 Peter 3:1-6, 1 Samuel 25:32). On the other hand, both masculine and harlot power are prohibited to women. Masculine power in women is an ineffective way to try to "win friends and influence people," since it is only grudgingly tolerated by most men. It is unnatural and far from lovely. Feminists, like homosexuals, believe this rampant disgust for the unnatural is not natural, but wholly programmed into people by traditional Christianity and parenting. This is why they work so hard to undermine parental rights in the name of children's rights. But they are wrong. The principle distinctions and roles of both sexes are ordained and designed by the Creator from the beginning. The subversion of these distinctions is "against nature" (1 Corinthians 11:14-15, Romans 1:26). Therefore, it is only by searing the conscience through mass indoctrination, over time, that the abnormal and hideous can grow to be tolerated by society.

Feminists like Betty Friedan thought that women in the public eye must exercise masculine power to be taken seriously as leaders over men. In one sense, they were right, since the strength of feminine power is found in its weakness, which calls forth male protection and cherishing. This is hardly a quality that a nation desires for the head of its military! The 19th century feminists actually warned against abandoning this feminine power, since, in their view, it was the only thing that keeps men from brutalizing women. Therefore, feminists are between a rock and a hard place. Neither feminine power, nor masculine power (in women), is conducive to influencing and leading men politically.

Likewise, harlot power is almost useless to this end. A godly man despises it; an ungodly man only uses it as an object. This is a great dilemma for women who desire to be in political office. What image should they portray? Masculine power on a woman repels most men (and even many women). This is one reason Hillary Clinton had such a hard time, and had to use the influence of her husband. She attempted to utilize masculine power. And it was naturally offensive to many men - even if they could not openly admit it in their politically-correct environment. Hillary "Rodham" Clinton is a product of 1960s, feminist propaganda. Many believed that McCain launched Palin to appeal to women; and they are surprised to find, that in polls, she appeals to more men than women. It is not just mere beauty, but the beauty of femininity that the men are noticing. Palin is attempting to strike more of a balance between the three powers, and this has not often been attempted - at least in modern American politics.

When it comes to her dress, Palin is certainly not always the Biblical ideal. She has indeed replaced Hillary's token trousers; but often with short, form-fitting, pencil skirts (without stockings). There is a strange mixture of all three powers. Booth Moore, a Los Angeles Times fashion critic, had enough discernment to call attention to Palin's slightly revealing, silk jacket and open-toed shoes. However, she also mentions the fact that Palin has longer hair than any major female U.S. political figure. Amidst the backdrop of the political and entertainment landscape that most people have grown accustomed to beholding, Sarah Palin actually appears very feminine and wholesome.

Sarah Palin was born in 1964. Hillary Clinton was born in 1947. A good number in Palin's generation have largely abandoned many of the harsher ways of the 1960s feminists. They may have large families. They often choose stay-at-home-motherhood over careers. They attempt to stay married. They are not afraid to show forth feminine beauty. They often let their hair grow longer. They smile and carry themselves in more feminine ways. In short, they are more delightful in a pure way, than many of the earlier feminists who were taught that they must hide their femininity in fear (1 Peter 3:6). After years of beholding icy women politicians, with strained, plastic smiles, short hair, and men's clothing (Leviticus 6:10, Daniel 3:21), how wonderfully refreshing it is to see a feminine woman in the news. Her longer hair, her feminine smiles and expressions - it is all a large part of the appeal of Sarah Palin. I knew this without even checking the news reports. I knew that men will respond to her, not because she possesses greater beauty, but because, at least to some degree, she has found the power of natural, feminine beauty. In some other area of life, it would not be as noticeable. But in the arena of politics, abundant motherhood and femininity are considered to be unpardonable sins. And in such a dry and barren desert, a feminine woman is certainly delightful to behold - not in a lustful manner, but in the God-ordained, natural manner described by the Apostle Paul (1 Corinthians 11:13,15).

Notice some comments and reports from the media:

"Addy - like some of the other men at the tavern - weren't at all intimidated by the first female Republican VP candidate. 'I like that she's coming out fighting. She has a really impressive delivery and I LIKE HER HAIR,' said Connor Barrett."
("Barroom Guys Hail Sarah," New York Post, Sept. 4)

"Sarah Palin brings the Hillary Clinton era to an end - Whether or not Sarah Palin wins, for American women, politics will never be the same again, says Anne Applebaum - She wasn't going to 'stay home and bake cookies,' she was going to reform the health-care system: if we elected her husband, we were thus going to get 'two for the price of one.' With those words, Hillary Clinton launched herself into America's national consciousness, and began a political career that very nearly brought her the Democratic presidential nomination earlier this year. Though she lost that contest, along the way she succeeded in making herself into something more than an ordinary woman in politics. She became an archetype, the Female American Politician. More than that: she became the archetype of the Powerful American Woman. She herself once explained the hostility she inspires as the misdirected fury of men who were angry at a 'female boss' or other female authority figure. They felt bad about being subordinate to a woman at work, so they took it out on her...it's true that her personal style - frequently chilly, determinedly frumpy, visibly calculating, pointedly humourless - did come to seem like a kind of norm. That's why, when she lost the Democratic nomination, it wasnâ€™t hard for some to see it as a defeat for all women. If Hillary couldn't make it in national politics, her disappointed supporters declared, then no woman could...As it turns out, there are numerous ways for women to be politically powerful in America, and they don't all involve wearing shapeless TROUSER suits and looking frosty: Sarah Palin, enter stage right...At age 44, she is also the most prominent representative of her generation of women - a generation which already looks set to be different, in important ways, from its predecessors...Unlike Hillary and her contemporaries, the women of Palin's generation are not feminists, but rather post-feminist...in recent years American women, particularly wealthy ones, have left the workforce in large numbers...the appointment of Palin does bring the Hillary Era to an end..."
(http://www.telegraph.co.uk)

One, so-called, "human behavior expert," observes:

"Palin is feminine, mysterious, homey and appears sincere. Palin doesn't try to be masculine...Hillary Clinton was harsh, cold and didn't exude a lot of femininity. Hillary Clinton gave off a subconscious vibe of being a bitter, cold and jaded woman. Palin seems fresh, with a down to earth organic image that makes her approachable and relatable to the American public."
(Patrick Wanis)

Of course, the homo-sexualized stylists of this age (as well as some women) are not happy with Palin's more feminine look:

"...must her hair suffer? With her long, straight, often pinned-up locks...'It's about 20 years out of date,' said Boston stylist Mario Russo of the Alaska governor's [hair] do...Belmont stylist Leon De Magistris...[argues] 'She's disheveled. It's way too long ...She needs a cut.'"
(Lauren Beckham Falcone, Boston Herald)

In other words, they appear to want her to look like Hillary! This is why truly wise women will never allow homosexual stylists or fashion designers (or aging feminists) to tell them how to look. They all have an agenda. They usually have no idea what appears wholesomely lovely to normal men. They will dress women in striped, square trouser-suits with square shoulders, and chopped, boyish hair. Yuk! Jesus made flowers, sun-rises, and women. They were made, in part, in God's mercy, to sweeten man's existence.

So what is good about Sister Palin? She has longer hair (praise God). She even, at times, wears it down and flowing. She is certainly more feminine (in some ways) than her political peers. She has a large family, and is not ashamed of it (praise God). She has given us a good example of valuing life over her own selfishness, in not aborting her baby with down syndrome. And finally, she has achieved success without the "victimhood" that the feminists hold so dear.

What insanity it is to see many feminists complaining that Palin should be home with her children (see Sally Quinn of the Washington Post)! On one aside, we have so-called conservatives (with Evangelical Christians at the front of the line) excusing Palin's LIBERAL-FEMINIST decision to seek a career and neglect her children, while on the other side, we have the feminists arguing that Palin should be at home making brownies with her children! Can anyone make sense of this?

Are these contradictions by design to some degree? Or is Palin simply representative of the contradictions most Christians and conservatives find themselves in today? Certainly, the radio programs that portray themselves as the most conservative, often utilize the least conservative music, etc. On one side, their comments argue for conservative principles (at least, sometimes!), while their music, attitude, jokes, image, and much of their morality, argue for everything that works against the supposed conservative ideals they advocate. Many churches and preachers also have this contradiction. On some issues, they are literalists and will contend against the fallen culture. But on other issues, just as weighty, they adopt the very same excuses and vain reasonings that they contend against in other areas. When a building is being demolished by a wrecking ball (not planted explosives) part of a wall may stand, while half of it is missing. It appears to be a great contradiction - until the wrecking ball strikes again. This is the state of the Christian and conservative world today. We are living in the midst of the prophesied falling away, when even many believers will not endure sound doctrine - especially in regard to lifestyle (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 2 Timothy 4:3). The foundations are being destroyed in degrees (Psalms 11:3).

At times, the contradictions appear to be designed. They often serve as enticements. How will Palin lead men with a softer, feminine look? She must balance this look with pictures and stories of her hunting large game and shooting big guns. This Yin and Yang dance is weaved throughout her whole image. She is both a mother of five, and a modern career-seeker; as a feminist, she vows to break the "glass ceiling" that Hillary came close to breaking; but she will do it in opposition to other issues important to the feminist agenda (abortion, etc.). She is portrayed as an obedient, Evangelical Christian, but her daughter is pregnant before marriage. Her husband is portrayed as masculine; but he must smile and hold the baby while his wife runs for an office that might one day place her at the head of the military fighting evil invaders, so that her husband and children can be safe back at home (Psalms 68:12)! This is very ironic, since one of the first feminists in the 19th century (E.C. Stanton) vowed that they had no desire to place the man at "the head of the cradle," or give up their "long and flowing garments," which speak of royalty and grace.

So what is the Biblical view of Sarah Palin? In spite of the good we have mentioned, the Bible advocates total obedience (not using righteousness in one area to excuse sin in another area). It is true that no one is absolutely perfect. But the parents of John the Baptist are said to be righteous, "walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless." While no man is absolutely perfect, there is a relative perfection that can be obtained, where are own hearts do not condemn us (1 Corinthians 4:4, 1 John 3:21). We must not presume upon this state, since God may see major sins in our lives that we do not see (Psalms 139:23-24). And we must be open for reproof from others who may see things more objectively in our lives than we can see ourselves. And finally, people who seek, or are placed in leadership positions have an even greater responsibility not to become a bad example in any area. Even the Gentiles of Persia knew how influential the disobedient actions of the queen would be to all the women of the empire (Esther 1:17, James 3:1). For these reasons, it behooves us to examine Sarah Palin's life and see what kind of role model she is providing for the women of this generation.  Certainly God can use people with faults to do great things. He used Samson against the Philistines. But that does not give us liberty to excuse sins in leaders or role models that may impact millions.

We do not have to search far to see that, in spite of much good, Palin is setting a wicked, humanistic example for women everywhere. For example, notice these words of McCain's daughter. Meghan McCain was asked by Larry King what she thought of Sarah Palin. Miss McCain responded that she was learning from Palin that it was possible to be a mother of a family and seek a career, at the same time!:

"I love that she's doing it all at once...she's such a role model for me...I love examples like that...."
(Meghan McCain)

But is it possible? It is Biblical? Is it godly and right? Our answer depends upon whether or not we will act like humanists or whether we will act like obedient Christians. Obedient Christians allow God to direct them on such issues. Humanists have been taught to "follow their hearts" and "lean to their own understanding." Let us hear what God says about this issue. Please read these Scriptures slowly. And if you will disobey them or explain them away, how will you ever say anything is wrong based on the Scriptures?:

1 Timothy 5:14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
15 For some are already turned aside after Satan.

Sister Palin is giving great occasion to unbelievers, and those of other religions, to speak reproachfully about Christianity. Multitudes of religious people (even in this age) have enough morality to know that a mother should guide the house and not seek a career outside the home. This causes Christianity to be mocked and despised:

Titus 2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

Sarah Palin has already endured much shame from opponents in the media, concerning her daughter's pregnancy. The Bible warns mothers that the curse causeless shall not come (Proverbs 26:2). It warns that when a mother leaves her children to themselves, so that she can seek a career, shame will surely come:

Proverbs 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.

It is a foolish generation that erases six-thousand years of Biblical wisdom and tradition, as if we are wiser than our fathers, or even God Himself:

1 Timothy 2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

Part of continuing in holiness (and having children continue in holiness) includes being present, with energy and time, to give children the upbringing they need.

The Bible is clear. I have seen couples disobey this command to their own hurt. We must embrace this plain morality if we profess to love Jesus:

John 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.

1 John 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus wants us hot or cold (Revelation 3:5). If a woman be not covered, with her God-given glory, let her shave off all of her hair (1 Corinthians 11:6). This is God's view of partial obedience (Matthew 23:32, Amos 4:4-5, James 2:10).

A columnist writing in WND recently hit the nail on the head, showing that natural light is enough to understand this responsibility:

"A popular children's author [Ms. Fox] has enraged mothers around the world after equating day care with child abuse... 'I don't know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work...it's actually child abuse'...While her opinion has ignited a storm of controversy, one has to wonder why. Are there people out there who honestly believe that infants and #toddlers are better off in the hands of day care workers than a loving mother or father? Perhaps the brouhaha has more to do with guilt than anything else...The debate coincides with the announcement that Sarah Palin will be John McCain's running mate in the U.S. presidential race. While Palin certainly seems to possess many admirable qualities, one has to wonder about a woman who would boast about returning to work three days after giving birth. Sorry, lady. That isn't something you should be bragging about. Research shows that the first three years are critical to a child's long-term development. A report by the New York-based Families and Work Institute found that the vast majority of the brain's synapses (the connections among brain cells) are formed during the first few years of life...My husband and I decided long before we had children that we would forgo certain luxuries to ensure that our kids had a stay-at-home parent. Life is all about priorities. I couldn't possibly work eight or more hours per day and pretend that my children came first. Putting our kids first meant walking away from a career that I loved in order to be there for our kids on a full-time basis..."
(Lydia Lovric, Is day care child abuse?, September 05, 2008)

Other articles reveal that mothers are increasingly opting to stay at home (see the introduction of this article). Is this one reason the Devil (and whoever profits from mothers abandoning the home) might be applauding and supporting Sarah Palin at this time?:

"'I'm having 'em, so I wanna raise 'em.' That's the philosophy that led Jenna Kagan to stop working when her daughter was born nine years ago...Singer, of MommaSaid.net, is annoyed by the assumption she feels some economists make that stay-at-home mothers want to work outside the home, but canâ€™t. 'I know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties,' she says, counting herself among them. 'We are NOT staying home with our children by default'..."
(MSNBC, Aug. 11, 2008)

In summary, if Palin influences more women to embrace more of their natural femininity, in dress and mannerisms, this well be a blessing. However, a cheerful, feminine woman in dress, who nevertheless, abdicates her throne of stay-at-home, committed motherhood (the ultimate gem of femininity), is like a jewel of gold in a swine's snout. Unlike Obama, I hold that the "pig" represents the valuing of a woman's career over the maternal care of children:

Proverbs 11:22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.

Women with true discretion do not let anything divert their attention from the care of their precious children. May women everywhere resist the bad example of Sister Palin in this regard.

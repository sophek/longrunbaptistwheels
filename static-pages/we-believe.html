            <h2>BRIEF DOCTRINAL STATEMENT</h2>
<h3>Kingdom Baptist Believes:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Salvation in eternity is by grace through faith alone in Jesus Christ. Jesus shed His Blood to redeem mankind.</li>
	<li>Water Baptism (i.e. immersion) is for believers only.</li>
	<li>The Bible is inspired and without error. We believe in the absolute preservation of the Scriptures through God's Providence. Today, the Authorized Version is God's perfect Word in English.</li>
	<li>The Godhead is a Trinity, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. All Three are fully God, yet distinct Persons. Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man.</li>
	<li>The Bible is able to meet every spiritual need of Christians. We are not dependent upon the psychology, philosophy, etc. of atheists and agnostics. These things tend only to pollute God's pure truth.</li>
	<li>The Second Coming will be Premillennial.</li>
	<li>The coming 1000 year Kingdom of Christ is a reward for faithful Christians that suffer with Him against sin and the world (2 Timothy 2:12). Christians may be punished at the Judgment Seat of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:9-11) and miss this 1000 year Kingdom. Yet, they will not lose salvation in eternity(1 Corinthians 3:15).</li>
	<li>The New Testament Church is a local assembly of believers with Jesus Christ as the Head. It is not a business.</li>
	<li>There is a literal Devil and a literal Hell with literal fire, and a literal Lake of Fire, which is the final destination of every unbeliever (the lost).</li>

            Why did the translators make mistakes in the chapter summaries in the 1611 version?

Wouldn't God have inspired this as well? Why would God inspire the English providentially accurate, but then allow misleading chapter headings? (Every chapter of the Song of Songs is interpreted as descriptive of the church.)

Answer: God did NOT inspire the KJV only translators and insure their theology was correct. In His Providence He simply made sure that they translated the right words. However, I cannot presently remember seeing any errors in chapter headings. There are multiple applications of the prophecies and Scriptures. There are secondary and primary applications, devotional, prophetic and historical applications. Some things in the Bible primarily refer to the coming Millennial Kingdom but yet could also contain a devotional, secondary application to NT churches and NT Christians in this age before the Kingdom.

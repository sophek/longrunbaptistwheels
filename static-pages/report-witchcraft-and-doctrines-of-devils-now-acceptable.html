        <div id="content">
            "Three hundred years ago, witches were hanged or burned at the stake. Today, witchcraft is celebrated as a hot teen trend in movies and television shows such as 'The Craft,' 'Charmed' and 'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.' Now, book publishers are hoping to cash in on this fascination, fanned by the record sales of the series featuring a boy wizard named Harry Potter. In recent months, four publishers have launched new paperback fiction series centered on teenage girls' involvement in witchcraft. Three series are written for teenagers: the 'Sweep' series by Cate Tiernan, published by Penguin Putnam; 'Circle of Three' by Isobel Bird, published by Avon; and 'Daughters of the Moon' by Lynne Ewing, published by Volo, an imprint of Hyperion Publishers. The fourth series, called 'T witches,' is written by H.B. Gilmour and Randi Reisfeld and is aimed at preteens. 'T witches' is published by Scholastic, regarded as the key player in series books, given its success with 'Goosebumps,' 'The Baby-sitters Club,' 'Animorphs,' 'Dear America' and, of course, 'Harry Potter.'...Scholastic publisher and editor in chief Jean Feiwel said the new series have merely tapped into an increased teen interest in witches. 'It's almost gotten - dare I say it - acceptable,' Feiwel said. 'There's no doubt that fantasy and wizards have become more popular because of Harry Potter. There's also been a trickle-down effect from the adult interest in New Age practices.'...The intensified teen interest in witchcraft mirrors a surge of general interest in spirituality among young adults, publishers say. Books about spirituality for teens, particularly teen Bibles and teen books about Wicca, are selling strongly, according to Publishers Weekly. Some experts say teen girls are particularly drawn to the goddess and nature worship that is an integral part of Wicca...The new witchcraft series feature provocative covers highlighting occult themes and titles such as 'Blood Witch,' 'What the Cards Said' and 'Night Shade.'..."

Comments: Why are so many Christians asleep? Why are so many settled down in movie theaters and in front of the TV? Why are so many gluttons in regard to food and entertainment? The early forefathers in some ways over-reacted to witchcraft. People should not have been murdered. In other ways, they under-reacted. They allowed their children to be influenced by the occultism of slaves. If Christians do not wake up and sound the alarm, many will be lost and the nation will be damned. What God says about last days Babylon can also apply in principle to us today: 

Isaiah 47:9 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the LOSS OF CHILDREN, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy SORCERIES, and for the great abundance of thine ENCHANTMENTS. 
11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off...

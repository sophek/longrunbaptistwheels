Now, let us notice some more examples of scientific foreknowledge in the
inspired Scriptures:

**********************************************
40. THERE IS AN EMPTY PLACE IN THE NORTH
**********************************************
Job 26:7 He STRETCHETH OUT the NORTH over the EMPTY PLACE, and hangeth the
earth upon nothing.

The phrase "stretcheth out" is usually used for the heavens (outer space):

Isaiah 40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that STRETCHETH OUT THE HEAVENS
as a curtain, and SPREADETH them out as a tent to dwell in:

Therefore, it appears that Job 26:7 is describing an "empty place"
associated with the north. It is possible that this verse is simply
stating that, as the Earth is hanging upon NOTHING, so is the heaven (as a
curtain) stretched out and suspended (like the Earth) upon NOTHING (i.e.
empty place). However, there does seem to be some evidence for an empty
place in the northern hemisphere. If this is true, it would mean that Job
26:7 not only foreknew that the Earth was hanging upon nothing, it
described an "empty place" that can only be seen by high-powered, modern
telescopes:

"Mitchell Waldrop wrote the following statement in an article in 'Science'
magazine. 'The recently announced 'hole in space,' a 300
million-light-year gap in the distribution of galaxies, has taken
cosmologists by surprise....But three very deep core samples in the
Northern Hemisphere, lying in the general direction of the constellation
Bootes, showed striking gaps in the red shift distribution.' ["Science,"
Nov. 27, 1981] This relative emptiness in the direction to the North of
our solar system is not visible by the naked eye. It is only as the result
of very careful observation by telescopes that scientists have recently
proven that Job was correct." ("The Signature of God," 2002)

The Celestial Equator is an imaginary circle made by extending the Earth's
equator into space. Celestial North projects the north pole into space.
Various secular, scientific sources also refer to a large BLACK HOLE in
the north. Therefore, this example is worthy of mention until more light
is shed upon the subject. At the very least, it reveals an amazing
foreknowledge of gravity, etc.

***********************************
41. DWELLINGS IN THE OCEANS
***********************************
Amos 9:2 Though they DIG INTO HELL, thence shall mine hand take them;
though they CLIMB UP TO HEAVEN, thence will I bring them down:
3 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and
take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:

Psalms 139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
in hell, behold, thou art there.
9 If I take the wings of the morning, and DWELL IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF
THE SEA;
10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

Jeremiah 49:8 Flee ye, turn back, DWELL DEEP, O inhabitants of Dedan; for
I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit
him.

The modern technology to dwell in outer space, and dig deep into the earth
and construct colonies, will also include the ability to place dwellings
in the oceans. Although some of the Scriptures are hypothetical, we know
from other Scriptures that some people will indeed be "cast out" and then
re-gathered from the heavens. The increasing, technological abilities to
place colonies in the heavens, and underground, make the promises and
warnings in the above Scriptures important for our age. Whether such
strange dwellings will be used to attempt to hide from God, or to imprison
the saints, they are not beyond the Lord's reach. Since dwelling in the
deep (i.e. sea) is also mentioned, it is noteworthy that man now possesses
the technological ability to place hotels, and other dwellings,
UNDERWATER:

"Dubai plans latest epic destination, with 220 suites UNDER THE SEA - It
already plans to build the tallest tower...now...Dubai is to host the
world's first underwater hotel. Called Hydropolis, the hotel will resemble
a giant submarine anchored in the Gulf, and accessed only by a tunnel via
a waterside reception area....Rapid development has seen Dubai utilise
every piece of space, building out into the ocean, up into the sky and
deep into the desert. In a bid to become a holiday mecca, relying on
tourist dollars rather than oil, the emirate aims to become the biggest
and best holiday destination..." (August 14, 2003, www.guardian.co.uk)
 
**********************************************************
42. CONSTELLATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
**********************************************************
Job 9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the CHAMBERS OF
THE SOUTH.

"The Greek astronomer Ptolemy made a catalog of 48 'classical'
constellations in the 2nd century AD: All are constellations visible from
the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere....16th & 18th century
travelers to the southern hemisphere filled in the rest of the sky."
(www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit1/night.html)

"There is not a little recorded in Holy Writ of which the ancients knew
nothing, but which was verified long afterwards. For example: 'Which
maketh Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades, and the chambers of the south' (Job
9:9): centuries after that was said the southern hemisphere was unknown!"
(Pink, "The Doctrine of Revelation")

***************************
43. ARCTURUS MOVES!
***************************
Job 38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
GUIDE ARCTURUS with his sons?

"Arcturus is about 37 light years away, and is the FASTEST MOVING of all
the 1st magnitude stars."
(http://www.mdsci.org/exhibits/observatory/logbook/2003.cfm)

"Proper motions were first noted by EDMUND HALLEY IN 1718 for three bright
stars: Sirius, Aldebaran, and ARCTURUS, by comparing his measurements of
their positions to those of Hipparchus of Rhodes (300BC). In all, IT TOOK
2000 YEARS for the motions to build up to the point that they became
apparent to naked eye observers. "
(www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit1/motions.html)

Yet, since our God made Arcturus, He obviously knew how fast it was
traveling. It is much larger than our sun and it is traveling at an
incredible rate of speed! But God has the raging suns under His control!

********************************
44. MOUNTAINS HAVE ROOTS
********************************
Before examining the inspired Scriptures in the Holy Bible which foreknew
the above information concerning mountains, notice the following modern
claim in regard to the blasphemous Qur'an. After absurdly stating that the
Qur'an is "God's word," because a drawn picture of an embryo looks like a
piece of chewing gum shaped into an embryo, the following claim is then
made:

"A book entitled 'Earth' is a basic reference textbook in many
universities around the world. One of its two authors is Professor
Emeritus Frank Press....His book says that MOUNTAINS HAVE UNDERLYING
ROOTS....This is how the Qur'an has described mountains. God has said in
the Qur'an: 'Have we not made the earth as a bed, and the mountains as
pegs?' (Qur'an, 78:6-7)....Could anyone during the time of the Prophet
Muhammad have known of the true shape of mountains? Could anyone imagine
that the solid massive mountain which he sees before him actually extends
deep into the earth and has a root, as scientists assert?" ("A Brief
Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam," 1997)

Could anyone during the time of Muhammad have known that mountains have
roots? Of course they could! Muhammad was born in AD 570. The following
INSPIRED SCRIPTURES were written over 2000 years before Muhammad was ever
born!:

Job 28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
MOUNTAINS by the ROOTS.

Deuteronomy 32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto
the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on
fire the FOUNDATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS.

These Scriptures teach that mountains have ROOTS. The word "roots" is even
used (not "pegs"). The alleged "evidence" of pre-scientific knowledge in
any other religious writings is always too late! If it has any validity at
all, it is because it has been derived from the Holy Bible. Remember, the
evidence presented in the Holy Bible is not limited to a FEW examples. It
is the multiplicity of these examples which takes us beyond the
possibility of coincidences or guesswork.

Long before the false prophet Muhammad, or modern science, the Bible
stated that mountains have roots:

"Is there any evidence that mountains have such deep roots? Yes, there is
abundant evidence from measurements of gravity over and near mountain
ranges."
(http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~rschott/g112/lecture6.html)

"Airy in 1855 proposed that Archimedes principle be taken
literally....This LED TO THE CONCEPT THAT MOUNTAINS HAVE 'ROOTS'"
(http://geodynamics.wustl.edu/classes/earth_forces_2002/lectures_2001/grav_02_p2.pdf)

********************************************
45. THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN RACE
*********************************************
Acts 17:25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any
thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
26 And HATH MADE OF ONE BLOOD ALL NATIONS OF MEN for to dwell on all the
face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the
bounds of their habitation;

The Bible teaches that every person on Earth today descends from Noah's
family, who descended from one couple, Adam and Eve:

"The Bible unquestionably teaches the unity of the human race. Is this
reconcilable with the discoveries of ethnology? It has been urged that
there must have been more than one original stock from which the race has
sprung....It is unfair to say that the Bible and anthropology or ethnology
are at war. First, because the scientific facts are not yet settled. The
men who have most diligently studied these subjects disagree among
themselves...."
(Arthur T. Pierson, "Many Infallible Proofs," 1885)

Anthropology (the study of man "as an animal") was born out of Darwinism.
It produced horrible fruit. Ota Benga, a pygmy, was exhibited to the
anthropology department at the St. Louis World's Fair. In 1906, he was
displayed with an orangutan in a cage at a New York zoo (Ota would commit
suicide ten years later). Darwinism would later culminate in Hitler's
wickedness. Therefore, sociological considerations (i.e. primarily, the
bloody trail of racism, marching from Darwin, to Nietzsche, to Hitler),
has helped to move even the modern, evolutionist anthropologists to
embrace the scientific facts which reveal that all present races have
diverged from a common ancestor. The Bible knew it all alone. It was
evolution which made fools out of the anthropologists.
 
******************************************
46. TOO MUCH SUGAR IS BAD FOR YOU
******************************************
Proverbs 25:27 It is not good to EAT MUCH HONEY...

Titus 2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not given to MUCH WINE...
[i.e. pure, unfermented grape juice, which is almost 100% glucose]

Modern books such as "The Sugar Blues" agree with this truth from God's
ancient Scriptures:

"Excess sugar eventually affects every organ in the body. Initially, it is
stored in the liver in the form of glucose (glycogen). Since the liver's
capacity is limited, a daily intake of refined sugar (above the required
amount of natural sugar) soon makes the liver expand like a balloon. When
the liver is filled to its maximum capacity, the excess glycogen is
returned to the blood in the form of fatty acids. These are taken to every
part of the body and stored in the most inactive areas: the belly, the
buttocks, the breasts and the thighs.
When these comparatively harmless places are completely filled, fatty
acids are then distributed among active organs, such as the heart and
kidneys. These begin to slow down; finally their tissues degenerate and
turn to fat. The whole body is affected by their reduced ability, and
abnormal blood pressure is created....As a steady diet, sugar is worse
than nothing. Plain water can keep you alive for quite some time. Sugar
and water can kill you. Humans [and animals] are 'unable to subsist on a
diet of sugar'."

Refined sugar, with nutrients depleted, is obviously even more dangerous
to abuse. Biblical honey was filled with B Vitamins and other nutrients
that are absent in "high fructose corn syrup" and white, refined sugar.
The modern epidemic of diabetes, and other afflictions, is the consequence
of people thinking they are smarter than God's Bible. God approves of
sweets (Isaiah 43:24). But His sweets do not have the vital nutrients
ripped out by people who have become so "dainty" in their tastes (Proverbs
23:6), that they cannot even endure the taste of whole-food sweets (which
are to be eaten in moderation). Man does the same thing to sweets, to
salt, to bread, and to every other food, that he does to the Scriptures.
He makes them pretty, white, and dainty, while destroying their food
value. Again, the Bible is many centuries ahead of modern nutritionists!

*****************************
47. THE MOSAIC DIET
******************************
The OT prohibitions in Leviticus chapter 11, etc., are now known to be
thousands of years ahead of their time. Nutritionists now know the dangers
associated with scavengers, and animals unable to cleanse themselves of
toxins. The Mosaic regulations concerning sanitation and hygiene had
physical and medical implications unknown to all ancient peoples before
the discovery of germs. In the same manner, the dietary regulations also
had physical and medical implications unknown to mankind for centuries.
The facts of modern nutrition would argue that God has no more overruled
the PHYSIOLOGICAL consequences of rejecting the Mosaic diet, than He has
overruled the physiological consequences of rejecting the Mosaic laws
concerning sanitation and hygiene. The fact that a man is no longer
spiritually unclean for touching a dead body, does not mean that
he is not physically contaminated! And the same wisdom which would move us
to wash our hands in soap and running water after touching a dead body in
the field, would move us to beware of toxins in shellfish. But aside from
my Roloff digression, my primary point at hand is that our Bible is always
centuries ahead of modern researchers in ANY field upon which it speaks -
including NUTRITION. There are many other examples we could notice (e.g.
the delicate balancing of protein and carbohydrates, as in fish AND bread,
lamb and bread, etc.; the command to not be a "riotous," or excessive
eater of flesh, etc.). But this more than enough to demonstrate that our
Holy Bible is inspired. And although the subject of food is very emotional
(Eve stumbled over it), it would be a shame to not notice how far ahead
the Scriptures are concerning nutrition.

**************************************************
48. THE SUN EXERTS A FORCE UPON THE EARTH
**************************************************
Job 38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
DAYSPRING to know HIS place;
13 That IT might TAKE HOLD OF THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, that the wicked might
be shaken out of it?
14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

The sun is said to "take hold" on the ends of the Earth. Scientists now
know that the sun does indeed exert a gravitational force upon the Earth.

******************************************************
49. THE INNUMERABLE AMOUNT OF SEA CREATURES
*******************************************************
Psalms 104:25 So is this great and wide sea, WHEREIN ARE THINGS CREEPING
INNUMERABLE, both small and great beasts.

"An ocean floor without shelter - boulders, cobbles, sand ripples, shells,
and other natural litter - likewise leaves INNUMERABLE SEA CREATURES with
no place to hide, forage or breed...."
(abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/bottomtrawling991228.html)

*******************************
50. SEED EATING ANTS
*******************************
Proverbs 6:7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.

"The scientific skeptic affirms that the ant being a carnivorous insect,
could not gather her food in the harvest, and that the very nature of the
food would prevent it from being laid up in store; and that Solomon
committed the blunder of many amateurs, in mistaking the white cocoon of
the ant-pupae, properly known as ant-eggs, for grains housed for future
use. But what becomes of Solomon's inspiration? If he blunders in science
he may have blundered in theology....When, however, we study the ants of
Palestine, we find among them some species which not only feed upon seeds,
but harvest them; and if their stores are wet by the heavy rains, to
prevent their sprouting, they bring them to the surface and dry them in
the sun. More than this, late discovery shows that the agricultural ant
not only stores grain but prepares the soil for the crop, plants the seed,
keeps the ground free of weeds, and reaps the harvest....What becomes of
the inspiration of the SCIENTISTS, who charged him [Solomon] with
blunders!" (Pierson, "Many Infallible Proofs," 1886)

***************************
51. ROBOTIC WARFARE
***************************
Joel 2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the
LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;
2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: A GREAT PEOPLE and a
strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after
it, even to the years of many generations.
3 A FIRE DEVOURETH BEFORE THEM; and BEHIND THEM A FLAME BURNETH: the land
is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate
wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.
4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen,
so shall they run.
5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap,
like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong
people set in battle array.
6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall
gather blackness.
7 They shall run LIKE MIGHTY MEN; they shall climb the wall LIKE MEN OF
WAR; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break
their ranks:
8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path:
and WHEN THEY FALL UPON THE SWORD, they shall not be wounded.
9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall,
they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows
like a thief.
10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun
and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before HIS ARMY: for his camp is
very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the
LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your
heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your
God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and
the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine
heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore
should they say among the people, Where is their God?
19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send
you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I
will no more make you a reproach among THE HEATHEN:
20 But I will remove FAR OFF FROM YOU THE NORTHERN ARMY, and will drive
him into a land barren and desolate,

This particular army is not a plague of locusts. Such plagues are indeed
part of latter day judgments upon Israel. However, locusts do not BURN
WITH FIRE (2:3). And locusts do not fall upon swords and live (2:8). This
appears to be an army sent by the HEATHEN in the NORTH (2:19-20). It is
called the Lord's army because it is a JUDGMENT from God upon His people.
Nebuchadnezzar was called God's "servant" (Jeremiah 27:6) when he was used
to punish Judah. Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord's hand (Jeremiah
51:7).God paid Nebuchadrezzar and his army WAGES for doing a service for
Him (Ezekiel 29:19-20).

But how is it that this "people" is only "like" men of war, and "like"
mighty men (2:7)? And how is it that this army is able to go beyond normal
men in physical capacity? Such warfare and is only NOW made possible with
robotic warfare, exoskeletons, etc.!:

"War Without Bloodshed? Researcher Says Robots Could Fight Future Battles
S H E F F I E L D, England, Sept. 17 - Future wars could be fought by
robots commanded by humans, a specialist in robotics told Britain's
leading science conference. Within five years, 'we could withdraw from war
completely and let robots shoot it out,' said John Pretlove, a lecturer at
the University of Surrey. In addition to waging war, a system of
integrating virtual reality and the real world could be the key to
creating robots that could carry out other hazardous tasks such as mine
clearance, undersea exploration and work in radioactive environments,
Pretlove said. The key to this work is that we are not trying to replace
the man mentally but physically....Remote control robots using traditional
technology such as video cameras have already been developed. For example
a NASA robot called Dante transmitted messages from inside an Alaskan
volcano in 1994. Augmented reality was a step forward after largely
unsuccessful efforts to create robots that were intelligent, Pretlove said
at the annual British Association Festival of Science.
'In this approach (augmented reality) one doesnâ€™t try to replace the human
mind with a computer but rather to have the computer and the operator
co-operate to achieve what neither could alone,' Pretlove
said....Computerized teams of robots from five universities played in a
volleyball tournament at the science festival on Monday...."

"Japan Creating New Breed of Robots - TOKYO (AP) - The arena comes alive
with cheers and shouts when the referee signals for the bout to begin.
Pushing and shoving, the wrestlers try furiously to drive each other

except the wrestlers are robots. Japan, a global leader in industrial
robotics, is now turning out mechanical marvels that walk, talk and even
swim - placing a new focus on robots that serve more as companion or
entertainer than servant....Robot competitions featuring everything from
wrestling robots to computerized, maze-running 'mice' have become the
latest craze among teen-agers and tech-junkies....The government also has

warfare: a tactical success with zero risk to American personnel. Today,
as casualties continue in Iraq, itâ€™s hard not to ask the question: when
will similar robot warriors relieve our foot soldiers as well?....with a
rapidly increasing U.S. military research and development effort into
everything from tiny spy robots that can be hurled into enemy buildings

CONCLUSION
 *****************
We have covered FIFTY-ONE examples of scientific foreknowledge. If one or
two do not impress the reader, or the skeptic, there are dozens more! And
after these fifty-one, there are more that have already been found which
are not listed here; and certainly there are many more that will be found
as scientific knowledge gains greater light. There is no other book like
our Holy Bible! And we have not even mentioned DIRECT BIBLE PROPHECY in
this study! It is my prayer that the Lord will use this research to
encourage saints to trust our Scriptures, and convict unbelievers to
distrust their own folly.

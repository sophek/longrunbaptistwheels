        <h1>THE OCCULTIC CONSPIRACY TO REPLACE THE KING JAMES BIBLE</h1>
        <div id="content">
            On October 12, 2011 Pastor Joey Faust spoke in Indiana at the Unregistered Baptist Fellowship. The message he spoke provided an introduction to his new book The Word: God Will Keep It which exposes that, just as the devil attacked the Word of God in the garden, he continues to do so during these perilous times.
<blockquote><span><strong><em> </em></strong>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. - 2 Timothy 3:1</span></blockquote>

        <h1>WHY WOMEN SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN OUR CHURCHES</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote>Revelation 2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, becauseÂ thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, toÂ teach...</blockquote>
<blockquote>1 Timothy 2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.Â 12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man,Â but to be in silence.Â 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.Â 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in theÂ transgression.</blockquote>
<blockquote>1 Corinthians 14:34 Let your women keep SILENCE in the CHURCHES: for it isÂ not permitted unto them to SPEAK; but they are commanded to be underÂ obedience, as also saith the law.
38 But if any man be IGNORANT, let him be ignorant.</blockquote>
<strong>Introduction</strong>

Paul (as in 1 Corinthians 14:38), continually views the contentious,Â emotional stubbornness of many Christians (especially in regard to theÂ women who control them) as something practically insurmountable. Yet,Â there ARE many who are open to information. Therefore, this article isÂ offered in this perilous hour to all who are willing to reason upon theÂ subject of women speaking in the church. It is also hoped that it willÂ encourage others who have already chosen to obey God's commandments concerning women in our churches.

The conclusion of this article is that women are permitted to teach andÂ testify among women, teach children, and testify and pray aloud with menÂ in private, small group, and non-church situations. They are also allowedÂ to sing among the mixed church assembly. Yet, in regard to regularÂ speaking, they are called to remain silent in the mixed church assemblyÂ (i.e. any time the "church" is gathered). This holy silence is a form ofÂ submission. Among other things, it is a sign that communicates to theÂ assembly (especially the growing children), God's order for the church andÂ home. Homosexuality did not grow to be accepted overnight. TheÂ denominations did not get to the place to where they have to debateÂ ordaining women (or homosexuals!) overnight. The minor rules that we mayÂ think are unnecessary, when ignored, have far reaching implications forÂ Christians and society over time. This is why we should not lean unto ourÂ own understanding (Proverbs 3:5-7).

Everything and everyone in God's creation has its own sphere in which toÂ prosper. Sin is rebellion against God and His commands. It is thereforeÂ sinful for any angels, men, women, or children to leave the PLACE that GodÂ has ordained for them. Lucifer and his angels attempted to leave theirÂ domain on earth and desired to be like God in the Heavens (Isaiah 14:13).

Eve was also deceived by Satan into thinking that there was a better placeÂ ("as gods") for her than the place and position that God has ordained.Â Likewise, another group of perverted angels once left their assignedÂ place:
<blockquote>Jude 1:6 And the angels which KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST ESTATE, but LEFT theirÂ own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness untoÂ the judgment of the great day.</blockquote>
Both Jude and Peter, when describing the final falling away, reveal thatÂ professing Christians will be rebellious against godly AUTHORITY. TheyÂ will leave their places in a mad, Satanic lust for LIBERTY against God'sÂ commandments and ordained ORDER:
<blockquote>2 Peter 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even asÂ there SHALL BE false teachers among you...
10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,Â and DESPISE GOVERNMENT. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not
afraid to speak evil of dignities.
19 While they promise them LIBERTY, they themselves are the servants ofÂ corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought inÂ bondage.</blockquote>
This final, Laodicean rebellion will have a form of godliness (i.e."spirituality"). It will, therefore, deceive many women:
<blockquote>2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shallÂ come.Â 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,Â blasphemers, DISOBEDIENT to parents, unthankful, unholy...
5 Having a FORM OF GODLINESS, but denying the power thereof: from suchÂ turn away.Â 6 For OF THIS SORT are they which creep into houses, and lead captiveÂ SILLY WOMEN laden with sins, LED AWAY with divers lusts...</blockquote>
Some women in the last days will be led "away." They will be led away FROMÂ the place and position that God has assigned for them:
<blockquote>2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure SOUNDÂ DOCTRINE; but after their own LUSTS shall they heap to themselvesÂ teachers, having itching ears;Â 4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turnedÂ unto fables.</blockquote>
Silly women (the opposite of wise women) will be led away by their lustsÂ (2 Timothy 3:6, 4:3). Eve was led away by her lust for POWER. Many women,Â in these last days, will be led away (in various degrees) in a lust forÂ more power and authority. "Laodicea" (Revelation 3:14) means "rights ofÂ the people." They will find God's commandments to be vexing andÂ constraining. They will not endure SOUND DOCTRINE (2 Timothy 4:3). "SoundÂ doctrine" is found in Titus 2:
<blockquote>Titus 2:1 But speak thou the things which become SOUND DOCTRINE:Â 2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, inÂ charity, in patience.Â 3 The AGED WOMEN likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness,Â not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of GOOD THINGS;Â 4 That they may teach the YOUNG WOMEN to be sober, to love their husbands,Â to love their children,Â 5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their ownÂ husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</blockquote>
This passage in Titus 2:5 explains clearly what many of our churches inÂ the last days will depart from! While the final rebellion is by no meansÂ limited to women, the Holy Ghost clearly reveals that SILLY WOMEN (and theÂ false teachers who prey upon them for money - see 2 Peter 2:3) will be oneÂ of the reasons that the final age will be extremely dangerous. These falseÂ teachers will "creep" into the houses (e.g. television, radio, computer,Â etc.) and promise these "religious" women LIBERTY (2 Peter 2:19). TheyÂ will use smooth words to lead many "devout" women away from such "goodÂ things" (Titus 2:3) as motherhood, the home, obedience to husbands,Â immoveable affection for their husbands and children, modesty, and SILENCEÂ IN THE MIXED CHURCH ASSEMBLY. But Satanic freedom is not true freedom (2Â Peter 2:19-20). It is the slippery slope back down to the Prodigal's mireÂ (2 Peter 2:22, Luke 15:16). With this introduction, let us now take a lookÂ at some general history in regard to women speaking in professingÂ Christian churches.

<strong>The Quakers and the Methodists</strong>

The Bible teaches that "evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,Â deceiving, and being deceived" ( 2 Timothy 3:13). Therefore, any viewÂ concerning holiness in these last days that departs radically from whatÂ godly Christians have always believed throughout history should beÂ immediately questioned; especially when it is forced to use radicalÂ translations, etc., for its own defense. Christian history cannot be usedÂ to prove doctrine. Yet, when it is almost entirely against us, it shouldÂ certainly be used as a red-light, calling for a closer, BiblicalÂ examination of our doctrinal views.

Most professing Christians in history have obeyed God's commandsÂ concerning women which He gave through the apostle Paul. Robert E.Â Billings, Jr., writes:
<blockquote>"From the time of the Reformation in the 16th Century, until some time inÂ the 1970s, there is virtually no record of women speaking in EvangelicalÂ churches. However, today, with increasing frequency, churches that haveÂ historically been Evangelical are allowing women to speak at the meetingÂ of the church....Feminism teaches that there are no significantÂ distinctions between male and female and that the sex roles in society areÂ interchangeable. All these views are antithetical to the Word of God. TheÂ Humanist, the Relativist, and the Feminist would all say that in anyÂ organization, including churches, women should do the same things as menÂ and that men should do the same things as women. But the Bible does notÂ teach this."Â ("Should Women Speak in the Church Meeting?," Everyday Publications)</blockquote>
There have certainly been some exceptions. The heretical George FoxÂ (1624-1691) and his radical Quaker followers (e.g. Margaret Fell) hadÂ already attempted to apply Paul's admonitions for women to be silent toÂ specific churches in Paul's day, thus allowing future women to ignore theÂ commands. George Fox would, therefore, certainly be a historicalÂ application of 2 Timothy 3:6.

Later, John Wesley and the early Methodists reasoned that perhaps God hadÂ a greater role for women that was not being realized. He came close to theÂ Scriptural ideal by separating small "society" meetings from the churchÂ assembly, and allowing women to pray aloud and testify (but not to teachÂ or preach) in these small groups. However, the lines became blurry whenÂ these meetings began to grow in numbers, and the women began to call for aÂ clear distinction between "exhorting" and actual preaching. Men such asÂ Wesley (and later Finney) were correct in realizing that women should beÂ involved in active evangelism. They were, however, very wrong by sometimesÂ (though with hesitation) endorsing women to speak in churches. AfterÂ Wesley's death (1791), Methodists, for a time, put a lid on women speakingÂ in their churches. However, the door had been opened, and the great goodÂ that was performed by the early Methodists would be used to justifyÂ disobedience to 1 Corinthians 14:34 and 1 Timothy 2:11 for centuries toÂ come.

Yet, the fight was on. For example, in 1832, the general Assembly of theÂ Presbyterian Church in America, approved a document stating:
<blockquote>"Meetings of pious women by themselves, for conversation and prayer,Â whenever they can conveniently be held, we entirely approve. But let notÂ the inspired prohibitions of the great apostle of the Gentiles, as foundÂ in his epistles to the Corinthians and to Timothy, be violated. To teachÂ and exhort, or to lead in prayer, in public and promiscuous assemblies, isÂ clearly forbidden to women in the Holy Oracles."</blockquote>
In the first half of the 19th century, not only did women NOT speak inÂ most churches (except in Quaker groups, etc.), it was actually consideredÂ highly improper for a woman to address ANY mixed audience:
<blockquote>"The debate over women's involvement in the American Anti-Slavery SocietyÂ dated all the way back to its founding in 1833....the joint participationÂ of men and women in public meetings was considered most improper....ByÂ 1840, however, women were speaking and holding office in some of the localÂ AASS. organizations....It is this...that caused the AASS to split apart atÂ its national meeting in May 1840."Â (Norma Johnson, "Remember The Ladies: The First Women's RightsÂ Convention," Scholastic, 1995)</blockquote>
Even Queen Victoria, at the time, let her husband speak for her whenÂ addressing mixed assemblies.

<strong>The Antichristian Feminists</strong>

By 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) had launched the first Women'sÂ Rights Convention with Lucretia Mott (1793-1880), who was a well-knownÂ Quaker. The advertisement for the convention itself was morally shockingÂ at the time:
<blockquote>"On Friday the notice appeared in small print before the 'Courier'Â readership's astonished eyes: 'Women's Rights Convention - A convention toÂ discuss the social, civil, and RELIGIOUS condition and rights of woman,Â will be held in the Wesleyan Chapel, at Seneca Falls, N.Y....During theÂ first day the meeting will be exclusively for women, who are earnestlyÂ invited to attend. The PUBLIC GENERALLY are invited to be present on theÂ second day, when Lucretia Mott, of Philadelphia, and other ladies andÂ gentlemen, will address the convention.'....It seemed innocentÂ enough....But buried beneath the small print were inflammatory words andÂ phrases...'The public generally are invited...'...that meant aÂ 'promiscuous assembly,' men and women mixed, most improper."Â (Norma Johnson, "Remember The Ladies")</blockquote>
Before this first convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton met with other ladiesÂ at the home of Mary Ann McClintock. At McClintock's mahoganyÂ "spiritualist" table, Stanton quickly drafted the Satanically inspired,Â "Declaration of Rights and Sentiments." Radical feminism was born. Even atÂ its birth, it did not hide that its ultimate goal was to rewrite the HolyÂ Scriptures. The new Declaration objected:
<blockquote>"He [males] allows her in Church, as well as State, but a subordinateÂ position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from theÂ ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public participation in theÂ affairs of the Church."</blockquote>
On July 20th, 1848, these early feminists passed the following resolution:
<blockquote>"Resolved, That inasmuch as man, while claiming for himself intellectualÂ superiority, does accord to woman moral superiority, it is pre-eminentlyÂ his duty to encourage her to speak, and teach, as she has an opportunity,Â in ALL religious assemblies....it is time she should move in the enlargedÂ sphere which her Creator has assigned her."</blockquote>
Decades later, Stanton would birth and edit the blasphemous, "Women'sÂ Bible" (1895). In it, this mother of feminism would write:
<blockquote>"Come, come, my conservative friend, wipe the dew off your spectacles, andÂ see that the world is moving....your political and social degradation areÂ but an outgrowth of your status in the Bible."</blockquote>
She stated that the Scriptures were NOT inspired, and that they must beÂ rewritten, with certain parts deleted! In its commentary on Paul'sÂ commands concerning women speaking in churches, Louisa Southwort in "TheÂ Woman's Bible" (p. 159) writes:
<blockquote>"...should it be so often quoted as having Divine sanction?"</blockquote>
She argued that it was unlikely that Paul actually wrote the command forÂ women to remain silent in the churches. She argued that if he did, it isÂ unlikely that is was based on an inspired command from God. StantonÂ herself argues:
<blockquote>"The church at Corinth was peculiarly given to diversion and toÂ disputation; and women were apt to join in and to ask many troublesomeÂ questions; hence they were advised to consult their husbands at home."Â (p.159)</blockquote>
Another writer, in this blasphemous commentary, argues:
<blockquote>"This mother and grandmother under whose teaching Timothy had becomeÂ qualified to receive the important office of bishop...were required toÂ keep silence in the Church equally with all other women whose evidence ofÂ faith were not so conclusive....The ban was placed upon women solely onÂ the ground of sex. The Church has only in this nineteenth centuryÂ partially amended this record, by establishing the order of deaconessesÂ for women who devote themselves to good works and religious teaching.Â While in the liberal denominations the pulpit is accessible to woman, itÂ is only in recent years that in any evangelistic denomination it has beenÂ permissible for woman to 'teach.' The priesthood are as unwilling today asÂ was Paul in the first century, that women shall be placed on an equalityÂ in offices of distinction. perhaps this disposition comes of a dim, notÂ fully evolved consciousness that, 'when the present evolution of woman isÂ complete, a new world will result; for woman is destined to rule theÂ world...'....Until the feminine is recognized in the Divine Being, andÂ justice is established in the Church by the complete equality of womanÂ with man, the Church cannot be thoroughly Christian."Â (Lucinda B. Chandler, p.179)</blockquote>
This is how the 19th century ended. Spiritualism and Theosophy had joinedÂ hands with antichristian feminism to "go for the throat" of the apostleÂ Paul. One by one, all of the denominations and churches would becomeÂ embarrassed before the eyes of the world and would begin to bend Paul'sÂ inspired commands concerning women.

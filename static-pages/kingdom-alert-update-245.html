I am sorry for the shortage of "weekly" Kingdom Alerts lately. The daily
radio program, a wedding in our church, and a few other things have kept
me busy.

***************************************************************
WHEN TO REST... AND WHEN TO FIGHT! (Sermon, Joey Faust)
***************************************************************
Luke 18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not RECEIVE THE KINGDOM
as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?
19 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save
one, that is, God.
20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do
not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou
one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
23 And when he heard this, HE WAS VERY SORROWFUL: for he was very rich.
24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly
shall they that have riches ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

The Lord wants to give us the Millennial Kingdom. He wants us to receive
it from Him. However, He does not give it in the exact manner that He
gives salvation in eternity. For example, there were times in the OT where
God commanded the Israelites to stand still and see the salvation of the
Lord:

Exodus 14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, STAND STILL, and
see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the
Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for
ever.
14 THE LORD SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU, AND YE SHALL HOLD YOUR PEACE.
24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the
host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and
troubled the host of the Egyptians,
25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD
FIGHTETH FOR THEM against the Egyptians.
26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that
the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and
upon their horsemen.

This is what Jesus did for us on the Cross, in obtaining eternal salvation
FOR us. It involved NO WORKS of ours. We do not lift a sword, or a shield:

Titus 3:5 NOT BY WORKS of righteousness which we have done, but according
to his mercy he saved usâ€¦

Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should boast.

Galatians 2:16 Knowing that a man is NOT justified by the WORKS of the
lawâ€¦

Galatians 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
curseâ€¦

Romans 4:5 But to him that WORKETH NOT, but believeth on him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
imputeth righteousness WITHOUT WORKS,
7 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
are covered.

So we see that eternal salvation is given in a similar manner as Israel
defeated the Egyptians: It is totally a work of God ALONE, without any
participation of man. As Moses lifted up his wooden rod, so was Jesus
lifted up on the wooden Cross:

Exodus 14:16 But LIFT THOU UP THY ROD, and stretch out thine hand over the
sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground
through the midst of the sea.
 
John 12:32 And I, IF I BE LIFTED UP from the earth, will draw all men unto
me.
33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.

On the other hand, salvation into the Millennial Kingdom is given unto us
in ANOTHER MANNER. It is true that Jesus teaches in Luke 18:17, that His
disciples are to RECEIVE it. But Jesus is talking to His disciples who
already possess eternal salvation. They are called to receive the world to
come, or the kingdom, in a different manner than they have received the
free gift of eternal salvation. In regard to the future Kingdom, they do
not simply stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. They are called
to go up like Caleb and Joshua were willing to do in regard to the
Promised Land, TO FIGHT the giants by the Lord's power.

The fact that we must fight (instead of simply standing still and
watching), does not take away from the fact that the Millennial Kingdom is
something the Lord GIVES to us. For example, in regard to the land of
Canaan, the Lord was willing to give the POWER to Israel to slay the
giants:

Numbers 14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying,
The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
8 If the LORD delight in us, then HE WILL BRING US INTO THIS LAND, and
GIVE it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the
land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and
the LORD is with us: FEAR THEM NOT.

This is exactly what Jesus means in Luke 12, when He says that the Father
will GIVE us this Kingdom when we SEEK it:
   
Luke 12:31 But rather SEEK YE THE KINGDOM OF GOD; and all these things
shall be added unto you.
32 FEAR NOT, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure TO GIVE
YOU THE KINGDOM.
33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not
old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief
approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Jesus is giving His disciples the same type of encouraging words that
Joshua, a type of Christ, gave to Israel, when he told them not to fear
the giants. And when Jesus says that the Father will "give" us the
Kingdom, He means what Joshua meant, when he said that the Lord would
"give" the children of Israel the land of Canaan. Joshua never meant that
the land would necessarily be given without any battle at all! In the same
manner, Jesus does not imply that we will be given the future Millennial
Kingdom without any warfare at all. Caleb FOUGHT for the land by the Lord
power:

Numbers 14:24 But my servant CALEB, because he had another spirit with
him, and hath followed me fully, HIM WILL I BRING INTO THE LAND whereinto
he went; and his seed shall possess it.

Joshua 14:10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me [Caleb] alive, as he
said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto
Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now,
lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me:
as my strength was then, even so IS MY STRENGTH NOW, FOR WAR, both to go
out, and to come in.
12 Now therefore GIVE me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that
day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that
the cities were great and fenced: if so be THE LORD WILL BE WITH ME, then
I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
13 And Joshua blessed him, and GAVE unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron
for an inheritance.

Joshua 15:14 And Caleb DROVE THENCE the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

The Lord accomplished the redemption of Israel without Israel's active
warfare. Yet, the Lord accomplished Israel's possession of the Promised
Land THROUGH Israel's warfare. The first event pictures the eternal
salvation of a sinner. The second event pictures the Millennial salvation
of a son of God (i.e. a believer). The attempt by many preachers and
theologians to blend these two differing things into one creates a mess. I
actually heard one (so-called) fundamental Baptist preacher attempt to
combine these two things by teaching that the passages that say "without
works" do not refer to MORAL works! Thus, he teaches that we are eternally
saved "without works" as long as we define "works" to be Mosaic ceremonies
or sacraments, etc.!  There are many other "devices" used by these
teachers who erroneously attempt to blend these two things that are meant
to be kept distinct. But these attempts all end in absurdity and
confusion. The Buddha "no thinks, no thoughts." Yet, true, Bible
Christianity is not a maze of contradictions.

Therefore, if we will understand the Bible, we must keep certain things
distinct:

TWO AGES:
1. The Millennium (Future Kingdom, or World to Come)
2. The Eternal Age (after the Millennium)

TWO VICTORIES:
1. By Faith Alone (without Works)
2. By Faith and Patience (Works)

TWO RIGHTEOUSNESSES:
1. Positional (Imputed TO us, once and for all)
2. Practical (Infused, or Worked IN us, daily)

1. Impute: To place to one's account.
2. Infuse: To instil; to fill, as by pouring into.

2 Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that
needeth not to be ashamed, RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD of truth.

If we confuse any of these things, it will be disastrous! If we are
fighting and struggling for eternal salvation, where we are supposed to be
resting, and sitting still, we will be like the many legalists, who do not
have absolute assurance:

Romans 10:3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going
about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of God.
4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth.

Matthew 11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest.

Romans 3:21 But now the righteousness of God WITHOUT THE LAW is
manifestedâ€¦

Romans 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, WE HAVE PEACE WITH GOD
through our Lord Jesus Christ:

There are many legalists who are working for assurance of eternal
salvation! They are NOT resting. Because they have NOT SUBMITTED
themselves to God's IMPUTED righteousness, given in Christ, they have no
peace with God. Their works are DEAD WORKS. The are smiting the Rock
twice! They are going in the way of Cain (their own works without resting
in the Blood of the Lamb). These religionists see only ONE age to come.
They confuse verses concerning the 1000-year Kingdom with verses
concerning ETERNITY. They confuse imputed righteousness with infused
righteousness. They confuse the PRIZE of entrance into the Millennial
Kingdom (through faith and works), with the FREE GIFT of eternal salvation
(through faith alone). May the Lord open the eyes of these modern
Pharisees to rest in Christ while He may be found!:

"If he say that he cannot believe on Jesus Christâ€¦you tell him that
believing is no work, but a resting on Jesus Christ."
(Traill)

"In seeking justification or peace of conscience, from something wrought
in them by the Spirit, they are seeking these from that which is
confessedly imperfect, and which God never gave for such a purpose; nay,
they are rejecting the perfect righteousness of the Substitute, and so
preventing the possibility of their doing any acceptable work at allâ€¦.This
form of error is the more subtle, because its victims are not walking in
sin, but doing all manner of outward service, and exhibiting outward
goodness in many forms, regarding which we shall only say that they are
not pleasant to Godâ€¦.That there are works done BEFORE faith we know; but
we are assured that they profit nothing."
(Horatius Bonar, "God's Way of Holiness")

If eternal salvation is through "faithfulness" or "faith and works," then
the Muslims shame American "Christians." But eternal salvation is not
through OUR faithfulness. It is through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ,
who perfectly obeyed His Father's will, and submitted Himself to the death
of the Cross, and became the Saviour of the world! Woe to the Legalists
with their dead works. They attempt to cover their Legalism by sprinkling
flowers on the grace of God. They say, "Oh, I do not pretend to be saving
myself. It is only GOD'S GRACE that saves me. He performs these good works
in me. Without these good works, I will be lost. I thank God that I am
being saved by His work through me." Notice, these poor souls are not at
rest. They have no absolute assurance of eternal salvation. They are
attempting to be saved by the Spirit's work of fruitbearing THROUGH them.
They have the cart before the horse. We cannot walk in the Spirit until we
live in the Spirit. And we do not live in the Spirit until we REST IN
CHRIST'S FINISHED WORK.

But let us now change gears. Once we are resting in the imputed
righteousness of our Substitute, it is time to fight! In type, the
children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt without lifting a sword.
But they possessed the Promised Land by constant warfare!:

Exodus 17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword.

It is here that we see the second mistake! Once you finally get people out
of Egyptian bondage, and resting in their salvation, they begin to
complain about the fighting! "Ah, if I have to fight, why didn't I just
stay back in Egypt?":

Numbers 14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to
fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were
it not better for us to return into Egypt?

Hebrews 3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.
11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the living God.

Hebrews 4:11 LET US LABOUR therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
fall after the same example of unbelief.

Hebrews 6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who THROUGH
FAITH AND PATIENCE inherit the promises.

The Devil will try to discourage us. He will try to tempt us to give up in
regard to certain sins. The rich man in our text (Luke 18) went away
sorrowful; a tormented slave to his covetousness and greed. He was too
afraid to be without his earthly treasure. As Goliath taunted the
Israelites day after day, tormenting them, the Devil wants you to tremble
and suffer as a SLAVE before certain sins:

John 8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin.

Genesis 4:7â€¦if thou doest not well, SIN lieth at the door. And unto thee
shall be his desireâ€¦

Romans 6:12 LET NOT sin therefore REIGN in your mortal body, that ye
should obey it in the lusts thereof.
14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law,
but under grace.
16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
obedience unto righteousness?

Ephesians 6:10 Finally, my brethren, BE STRONG IN THE LORD, and in the
power of his might.
12 For WE WRESTLE NOT against flesh and blood, BUT AGAINST principalitiesâ€¦

To try to wrestle for eternal salvation is heresy. It is a damnable
legalism. But after we are assured of salvation by resting in His work on
the Cross - that is, after we have come out of Egypt - we should FIGHT the
good fight of faith. We must wrestle against the devils who tempt us and
discourage us. We must strive against sin:

Hebrews 12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

Revelation 2:10 be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown
of life.

2 Timothy 2:12 IF we suffer, we shall also reign with himâ€¦

Revelation 20:6 â€¦they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and SHALL
REIGN WITH HIM A THOUSAND YEARS.

If you are a Christian; you know that you are eternally saved by the Blood
of Jesus Christ, His finished work on the Cross, then it is time to BATTLE
against sin by the Lord's power. Do not rest where you should be fighting!
Do not say that the giants of sin are too big. You have not yet resisted
unto death. You have not yet been marytyred for your faith. Millions have
been tortured for Christ and His kingdom. Shall we then give up and make
excuses in a prosperous land of plenty? Shall we be carried away on
"flowery beds of ease," blaming God for forsaking us before the giants of
sin? God forbid:

1 Corinthians 10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is
common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to
escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

Let us manfully cast off the works of darkness. Let us despise the
pleasures of sin. There is a kingdom coming. Let us seek it, so we may lay
our kingdom-crowns before His feet and worship Him that gave us the
strength to overcome.

If you do not have assurance of eternal salvation, where is your faith?
Why are you not resting in the work of Christ? Why do you dare smite the
Rock (a picture of Christ) twice? Why do you stand there NAKED, seeking to
cover yourself with an apron of fig-leaves, when God has a BLOOD covering
waiting for you? Your good works (even when you try to give God credit for
them) are ODIOUS to God. They are filthy rags. They are dead. Unless you
rest in Jesus, fully assured of eternal salvation by His work alone, you
can never do works pleasing to God. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; rest
secure in Him. He will raise you up on the last day:

John 6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will
raise him up at the last day.

ROBERT C. WINTHROP ON THE KING JAMES BIBLE AND FREEDOM (1849)
**********************************************************************
Robert Charles Winthrop (1809-1894) was a Representative and a Senator
from Massachusetts. The following is part of his address delivered at the
Annual Meeting of the Massachusetts Bible Society in Boston, May 28, 1849:

"â€¦Mr. President, there is a striking coincidence of dates in the history
of our country, and in the history of the Bible. You remember that it was
about the year 1607, that King James the First, of blessed memory for this
if for nothing else, gave it in charge to fifty or sixty of the most
learned ministers of his realm, to prepare that version of the Holy
Scriptures, which is NOW EVERYWHERE RECEIVED AND RECOGNIZED AMONG
PROTESTANT CHRISTIANS AS THE BIBLE. This version was finally published in
1611, and it is from this event that the general diffusion of the Bible
may fairly be said to date. The Bible had, indeed, been more than once
previously translated and previously printedâ€¦[But]â€¦however precious the
Bible must have been to those who possessed it in those [earlier] days,
and however strong the influence which it may have exerted over individual
minds, it had little chance to manifest its power over the massesâ€¦.Indeed,
the whole number of printed Bibles in existence in Great Britain, up to
the commencement of the seventeenth century, is estimated at only about
one hundred and seventeen thousand; a little more than one fifth the
number distributed by the American Bible Society, and only a little more
than one tenth the number distributed by the British and Foreign Bible
Society, during the single year last past. It is, thus, ONLY FROM THE
PUBLICATION OF THE AUTHORIZED AND STANDARD VERSION OF KING JAMES, THAT THE
GENERAL DIFFUSION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES CAN BE SAID TO HAVE COMMENCED.
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PRINTED WORD OF GOD 'first began to have free course
and to be glorified.' AND THAT, YOU REMEMBER, MR. PRESIDENT, WAS THE VERY
DATE OF THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT OF THESE NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES. It was
just then, that the Cavaliers were found planting themselves at Jamestown
in Virginia; and it was just then, that the Pilgrims, with the Bible in
their hands, were seen flying over to Leyden, on their way to our own
Plymouth Rock. And now, Sir, IT IS NOT MORE TRUE, IN MY JUDGMENT, THAT THE
FIRST SETTLEMENT OF OUR COUNTRY WAS PRECISELY COINCIDENT IN POINT OF TIME,
WITH THE PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION OF THIS STANDARD VERSION OF THE
BIBLE, THAN IT IS THAT OUR FREE INSTITUTIONS HAVE OWED THEIR SUCCESSFUL
RISE AND PROGRESS THUS FAR, and are destined to owe their continued
security and improvement in time to come, to the influences which THAT
PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION COULD ALONE HAVE PRODUCED. The voice of
experience and the voice of reason speak but one language on this point.
Both unite in teaching us, that men may as well build their houses upon
the sand and expect them to stand, when the rains fall, and the winds
blow, and the floods come, as to found free institutions upon any other
basis than that morality and virtue, of which the Word of God is the only
authoritative rule, and the adequate sanction. All societies of men must
be governed in some way or other. The less they may have of stringent
State Government, the more they must have of individual self-government.
The less they rely on public law or physical force, the more they must
rely on private moral restraint. Men, in word, must necessarily be
controlled, either by a power within them, or by a power without them;
either by the Word of God, or by the strong arm of man; either by the
Bible, or by the bayonet. It may do for other countries and other
governments to talk about the State supporting religion. Here, under our
own free institutions, it is Religion which must support the Stateâ€¦..."

1852)

ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND SUICIDE (NEWS)
*******************************************
We have, for many years, maintained the link between suicide and
antidepressants. Now the truth is finally being realized. Suicide is
self-murder. Now the next step is to admit the many MURDERS of children,
parents, spouses, etc., that have been stimulated (at least in part) by
these brain drugs:

"Study Backs Antidepressant-Suicide Link - CHICAGO (AP) - A study of
nearly 2,800 British adults and children bolsters the evidence that
patients are prone to suicidal impulses when they are first put on
antidepressantsâ€¦.some relatives of people who have committed suicide blame
the drugs themselves, and British health authorities have said that most
serotonin-affecting antidepressants are unsuitable for children.
GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil, has been hit with a lawsuit accusing
it of suppressing studies indicating the drug might increase suicidal
tendencies in children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
investigating and earlier this year issued a public health advisory asking
makers of 10 drugs to add or strengthen suicide-related warnings on their
labelsâ€¦" (July 21, 2004)

AMERICA: ONE NATION UNDER ROME? (NEWS)
**************************************************
"Protestants soon to be minority in U.S., study finds - America's
Protestant majority is about to disappear, according to a new study by
researchers at the University of Chicago.
Since the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock nearly 400 years ago, America
has been a largely Protestant nation.  But as early as the end of this
year, Protestants likely will make up less than 51 percent of the
population for the first time in history, sociologists at the university's
National Opinion Research Center surmise in a new report released Tuesday.
According to survey results from more than 43,000 Americans gathered over
the last 30 years, the percentage of Protestants in the national
population has shrunk from 63 percent in 1993 to 52 percent in 2002.â€¦If
the Protestant majority does indeed disappear, the United States will be a
nation of religious minorities. The next largest religious group after
Protestant is Roman Catholic, at about 25 percent. The Catholic population
has remained stable over the last decade, according to the NORC study.
"The Catholic defection is [also] pretty large, BUT THEY ARE BEING
REPLACED BY IMMIGRANTS," said R. Stephen Warner, a professor of sociology
at the University of Illinois at Chicagoâ€¦"

STAGE-SETTING FOR THE MARK (NEWS)
****************************************
Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
free and bond, to receive a mark IN their right hand, or IN their
foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.

"Under-the-skin ID chips move toward U.S. hospitals - VeriChip, the
company that makes radio frequency identification - RFID - tags for
humans, has moved one step closer to getting its technology into
hospitals. The Federal Drug Administration issued a ruling Tuesday that
essentially begins a final review process that will determine whether
hospitals can use RFID systems from the Palm Beach, Fla.-based company to
identify patients and/or permit relevant hospital staff to access medical
records, said Angela Fulcher, vice president of marketing and sales at
VeriChip. VeriChip sells 11-millimeter RFID tags that get implanted in the
fatty tissue below the right tricep. When near one of Verichip's scanners,
the chip wakes up and radios an ID number to the scanner. If the number
matches an ID number in a database, a person with the chip under his or
her skin can enter a secured room or complete a financial transactionâ€¦.The
Italian Ministry of Health kicked off a six-month trial of the chips for
hospitals in April. VeriChip, a division of Applied Digital Solutions,
generated headlines worldwide recently with the announcement that the
Attorney General of Mexico implanted one of the small company's RFID tags
in his armâ€¦.The idea for employing the tags to identify humans came after
the horror of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, Fulcher said. Richard Seelig, vice president of medical
applications at Applied, saw on TV how firemen were writing their badge
numbers on their arm with pen so they could be identified in the event of
a disaster. He inserted Digital Angel tags in his body and told the CEO
that they worked. VeriChip was born. In June, the company hired Next Level
and Motorola alum Kevin Wiley as CEOâ€¦.The Baja Beach Club in Spain has
used them as electronic wallets to buy drinks. Sales have also taken place
in Russia, Switzerland, Venezuela and Colombiaâ€¦." (CNET News.com, July 27,

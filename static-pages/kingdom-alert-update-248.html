A REVIEW OF DR. LAURA'S "WOMAN POWER" (2004), WITH ADDED COMMENTARY ON
GODLY FEMININITY, BY JOEY FAUST
************************************************************************

In regard to "Woman Power" by Dr. Laura Schlessinger, there is much to
commend. However, I would like to begin with some important disclaimers.
Laura Schlessinger should clean up her language. Not only does she often
use psychological terminology in places where more traditional language
would be more precise, she occasionally uses foul language. She also
should give up on "therapy" and psychiatry, and learn to lean upon
inspired revelation (i.e. "thus saith the Lord") in moral matters. The
Bible warns Christians not to be "spoiled" by philosophy and science
"falsely so called" (Colossians 2:8, 1 Timothy 6:20). And the fact that
"Dr. Laura" is in direct opposition to modern pyschology in regard to so
many issues, reveals that psychology is nothing more than philosophy in
modern dress. And Christians must be careful not to give any philosophy
(or philosopher) more weight than inspired Scripture (even when such
philosophies masquerade as science to gain a hearing). Too often, in moral
matters, Schlessinger leans to her own understanding (e.g. espousing
covenant-breaking for less than Biblical reasons, etc). In regard to
marriage, in her latest books, she has not firmly stated the Biblical
doctrine of the submission of wives to their husbands. To her credit, she
has clearly begun to see the great "power" that women can have for good in
their families through rejecting radical feminism, and walking in classic
femininity. However, her eyes have not been wholly opened to the Christian
doctrine of the vast power of holy submission in changing wayward husbands
(1 Peter 3:1, 5). In a perhaps, tongue-in-cheek fashion, Schlessinger
gives some credence to the stereo-typed male as being happy with
fried-chicken, beer, and TV. This (while sadly true for many men), is not
a Christian ideal. It is not a true representation of so-called male
"needs." The most important thing of all is that Schlessinger needs to
believe upon Jesus Christ as her Saviour; she needs to be born again
through faith (or else she needs to make a public profession of such
faith). For these reasons, and others, I cannot unreservedly recommend
"Dr. Laura" to young, Christian women.

However, as Paul sometimes made reference to non-Christian philosophers as
a springboard for evangelism and discipleship (Acts 17:28), I believe the
recent writings of Dr. Laura can be used to show that the distinctions
between men and women are not only taught in inspired Scripture, they are
also found written in our hearts (in nature or conscience). Elizabeth Cady
Stanton (a 19th century feminist) once taught that if the Christian Bible
was destroyed or disproven, feminism could then thrive with no harm to
society. She did not realize that so-called feminism is not only against
the Bible, it is against NATURE (Romans 1:26, 2:14-15). Destroying the
Bible; publishing a new feminist "bible"; or issuing a Bible with infidel
commentary throughout its pages (see Stanton's "Women's Bible"), may
temporarily hide the law of God revealed in Scripture; yet there is a
certain amount of Godâ€™s law written in the heart of every person. For this
reason, modern feminism will never bring happiness or blessings. Those who
seek to live in direct opposition to how they were designed, will always
be plagued and cursed with a fallen countenance (Genesis 4:6-7).

However, as I intend to show in this article, young, Christian women would
probably get more light concerning basic morality from "Dr. Laura" than
they could get in thousands of so-called, conservative, Chrtistian
churches across America! This is because multitudes of churches (in the
alleged name of "evangelism") have become parrots and puppets of our
descending culture, instead of shining candlesticks to reprove it.  For
this sad reason, there is sometimes more "moral backbone" among unsaved
(though conservative), radio hosts, than can be found in multitudes of
Christian pulpits. For example, Schlessinger contends openly, with
passion, against working mothers, abortion, homosexual rights, etc. Yet,
many preachers will not touch these subjects; they are hirelings! But to
be silent upon such subjects as these, is to allow the Devil to seduce the
sheep, and allow immoral darkness to envelope the churches. The law of
harvest demands that we reap whatever we sow. Therefore, when there are no
warnings against drinking from the cesspool of worldly,
entertainment-culture - yet the pulpit is silent concerning the modern,
moral evils of day-to-day living - the churches will become about as
relevant in society as the local coffee-shop! And before long they will
begin to LOOK like the local coffee-shop; and then, finally, they will
BECOME the local, coffee-shop! God help us!

In Dr. Laura Schlessinger's new books, she has really upset the feminists.
She has done something that is forbidden among "modern women" (especially
in the public eye); she has affirmed the traditional understanding of the
God-given DISTINCTIONS between men and women. This is a grave evil
according to the sophisticated woman, for it blasphemes the unholy spirit
of feminism. Schlessinger has instead affirmed what is special about
women: their tendencies to nurture and nest. And these natural
characteristics of women are the very things that radical feminists have
worked so hard to brainwash out of the minds of young women.

Furthermore, Schlessinger (who calls the emotional, feminist reviews of
her book "tantrums") has ruffled more feminist feathers by exposing the
fact that marriage "abuse" works both ways. This is a taboo subject
according to the modern feminists. These radical feminists are quick to
justify women deserting their homes because of "insensitive men." However,
they do not view tantrums, railings, contentions, poutings, sarcasms,
eye-rolling, door-slamming, neglect of the marriage bed, etc., in the
wives, as "abuse." What is good for the gander is good for the goose!
Schlessinger writes:

"I have found it fascinating that most women are really not at all aware
of how dismissive they are toward their husbands' needs. That mentality
has become so commonplace in our culture that most women don't register it
as unkind, thoughtless, cruel, abusive, or down-right mean....It is that
women have not been encouraged to understand and appreciate men and
masculinity. Women have been trained to see men as 'the evil
empire'....There is so little in our culture that respects men and
masculine thought, feeling, and behavior....And don't think that the
psychotherapeutic environment has been any less hostile to husbands.
Generally, psychotherapists are ideologically liberal, drenched in the
feminist anti-male mentality which is propagandized in most of their
training programs....Finally, what some women call abusive or conmtrolling
sometimes gets silly."(1)

In short, Schlessinger, in her two latest books ("The Proper Care and
Feeding of Husbands," and "Woman Power") has simply affirmed the
traditional, common-sense differences between men and women. She is
attempting to teach modern women what it means for their husbands to be
"men." She is rebuking the modern tendency in society (and sadly, in many
Christians churches and ministries) to "feminize" men. Since the age of
radical feminism, lessons upon masculinity have been deemed off-limits,
since such lessons would obviously affirm distinctions between men and
women. And such distinctions are the very things that feminists (who want
so much to look like men, behave like men, work like men, and be treated
like men) are militant in denying. But this feminist proganda has hurt
women. It has robbed them of healthy relationships with fathers, husbands
and sons (and other family members); and it has also robbed them of much
inner peace. Schlessinger writes:

"The 'feminist' notion of woman power as a rejection of femininity, of
child-rearing, of loving a man, and of maintaining a home both for
physical and emotional comforts has robbed women of choice and
satisfaction. One female radio talk show host thanked me at the end of the
interview about 'The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands,' by saying,
'You've made caring about your man acceptable again.'....Devaluing the
roles of wife and mother robbed women of an essential part of their
spiritual, emotional, and physical destiny."(2)

Of course, the true power for holiness and the source of true, inner
peace, is found in the Bible; in the new birth, and in obedience to the
Lordâ€™s commandments and ways. The Bible openly affirms the distinctions
between men and women that the feminists have sought to deny and decry.
The Bible teaches that women are blessed with nurturing qualities, while
men have been given governing qualities (1 Thessalonians 2:7, 11). It
states what is universally recognized in every society that has not
totally "lost its marbles." This is why Schlessinger (a former, practicing
Jewess) has been able to see these truths. These distinctions, and the
fact that such distinctions should be preserved in society, are laws that
are written upon the very hearts of both Jews and Gentiles (Romans
2:14-15). They can only be removed through evil indoctrination and the
searing of the conscience - and then only with emotional pain and grave
consequences.

It is a crying SHAME that a Jewess (who, as far as I know, has never
professed belief in the Gospel) has had the moral courage and BACKBONE to
stand against the spirit of the age, and defend some morsels of basic,
common-sense-traditional-wisdom; yet many of our prominent, CHRISTIAN
leaders, armed with "exceeding great and precious promises," are more
interested in "not rocking the boat," and affirming everyone's
self-esteem! God forbid! What does it mean when some non-Christians are
found defending traditional values with more courage than many Christians?
It means that the only "salt" many Christians have today is on their
popcorn, as they sit before immoral movies, as lovers of pleasures more
than lovers of God (2 Timothy 3:4)!  What does this mean? It means that
many Christians are now guilty of causing the NEW TESTAMENT to be
BLASPHEMED by their lifestyles and attitudes. Christians should always
shine BRIGHTER in holiness, sobriety, and moral courage and fortitude,
than the "devout" people who have never come to a saving knowledge of
Jesus Christ:

Titus 2:10 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
ADORN THE DOCTRINE of God our Saviour in all things.

Philippians 1:27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel
of Christ...

Never once (unless brought there in chains), do we find Christians in the
Bible attending ancient theaters (such as the famous theater in Caesarea).
The early church fathers wrote that even the Gnostic teachers never
debased and disgraced themselves by viewing such immorality for
entertainment. Why? One reason (apart from the obvious fact that evil
communications corrupt good manners), is that Roman poets, though
unbelievers in Christ, often had enough moral light in their consciences
to write against immoral theaters! Should Christians lower their standards
beneath the light that even lost people (without the Holy Ghost) can see?
God forbid! The New Testament truths would be blasphemed before the world.
Christians are called by Christ to walk beyond the light of mere natural
affection and conscience. Will it not, therefore, bring reproach upon
Christianity when even non-Christian moralists are able to accuse
professing Christians of falling below the mere light of natural law? We
are not discussing ceremonies and rituals, and things nailed to the Cross.
We are discussing the things that are written in the consciences of every
person born into the world. When these things are despised or ignored by
Christians, the New Testament is mocked and ridiculed:

1 Timothy 5:14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear
children, guide the house, GIVE NONE OCCASION TO THE ADVERSARY TO SPEAK
REPROACHFULLY.

In the Bible, the subject of mothers "guiding the house" is usually
ccompanied by the additional warning that a lack of such basic, natural
affection can cause the Word of God to be reproached. Some women in
foreign countries look upon many Christian women in America with disdain
for neglecting their children for a career. The Bible plainly teaches that
the doctrine of God our Saviour will be BLASPHEMED when Christian women
allow themselves to fall below the basic standards of holiness and
propriety written in the hearts of all men and women:

Titus 2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
things;
4 That THEY MAY TEACH THE YOUNG WOMEN to be sober, to love their husbands,
to love their children,
5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
husbands, THAT THE WORD OF GOD BE NOT BLASPHEMED.

It is a crying shame that a Jewess on talk radio will stand up and reprove
mothers for working outside the home, for not respecting their husbands,
for withholding the marriage-bed, for deserting their homes, for
slandering their husbands, for allowing relatives to come between them and
their husbands, etc., when such subjects are "too controversial" for the
average, lukewarm, sugar-coated, "let's win friends and influence people"
Christian pulpit! Where are the preachers? Where are the men? Where are
the elderly women who are willing to TEACH young women to quit griping,
and slandering their husbands, and forsaking their children? Why is it
that a Jewess is standing up for homeschooling, and calling parents to
forsake the public, humanistic indoctrination of youth (which has all but
damned this nation), yet such a subject is considered "too controversial"
for most, so-called Baptist churches?

Why are contentious Christian wives coddled and indulged by aged women in
Christian churches? Why is it that Laura Schlessinger can do more for a
young, rebellious wife in ten minutes, than many of these Christian women
(and even pastors) can do in five years with their coddling, coaxing and
sugar-coated "love"? It is because many Christians will no longer walk by
the Word of God. They have turned to the flesh, to emotion, to feelings.
They will not even live up to the natural light of conscience!
Irresponsible counseling, in the name of "compassion," is not Biblical
love. It is secret love without knowledge:

Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and
more in knowledge and in all judgment;
10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere
and without offence till the day of Christ;

Proverbs 27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.
6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend...

Women are under a great, Satanic attack today. And the pathetic pampering
rampant in many Christian families and churches; the placing of passion
before principle, is not helping them.

What does this all mean? It means that the "falling away" is occuring (2
Thessalonians 2:3). It means that these are the days when many Christians
will "not endure sound doctrine" (2 Timothy 4:3). Titus, chapter 2, gives
us "the things which become sound doctrine" (2:1). And Dr. Laura
Schlessinger (an unsaved Jewess) is doing a better job SPEAKING and
TEACHING most of these things in Titus 2, than most Christians in the
public eye! Schlessinger writes:

"What has, throughout all time, been special about women is their natural
tendency to bond, nurture, nest, show compassion, and love. When we speak
of 'mother love,' we talk about the purest and strongest of all
affections....Through social bonding, women are the LINK between their men
and family and society....The ultimate power of women is their unique
qualities: intuition, compassion, nurturance, sensitivity, sensuality,
bonding, and nesting....Women are also the ones who ultimately create the
atmosphere in the home."(3)

This is true, and it is found taught in the very etymology of the Biblical
words "husband" and "wife." The word "husband" means "farmer," or the
"cultivator," the one who keeps the vineyard. The man is called to be the
one who manages the wife and children. He is to watch over his vine:

Psalms 128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.  

He is to cherish it, and nourish it, and lead it. He is to be the provider
and protector. The word "saviour" in Ephesians 5:23 can also mean
"preserver" in English. The husband, like Jesus, is to be the "preserver"
of the body. He is therefore called to be the provider. Feminism, as
Schlessinger continually reminds us, has greatly robbed many men of this
role. She writes:

"Men want their wives to....respect the fact that to feel like a man he
needs to provide for and protect his family." (4)

When mothers work outside the home, and make equal or more money than the
husband, not only are men discouraged in their natural, God-given role,
but women also begin to lose natural affection and respect for their
husbands. The whole relationship (physical and emotional) begins to
suffer.

On the other hand, the word "wife" means "she that works at the distaff."
In other words, it means "she that weaves or sews":

"Wife is from the verb to weave...one who works at the distaff..."
(Brewster, "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," 1900)

There is a physical meaning in these Biblical words. The "husband," being
the farmer, is out if the field or vineyard. The "wife" (as the one who
"sews"), is naturally "inside" the home. Thus, wives should be "keepers at
home" (not only should they not forsake the duties in the home, as their
primary work, but they should not let anything steal their affection away
from their husbands, children, and home duties. Many women bear children
or adopt them, and soon find that they would rather be "free" from such
responsibilities). Also, since a "wife" is the one who "weaves," she
should be blessing her home with her homemaking skills, her frugality, and
her economy. She is diligently "weaving" together, cooking, preparing,
etc., whatever the husband supplies through his provision.

But this weaving of the husband's provisions should also occur
spiritually. The husband, as we have seen, is the spiritual cultivator of
his home. He must wash it with the water of the Word, and lead it
(Ephesians 5:25-26). He has been equipped by God with discernment and the
gifts for this leadership role (1 Corinthians 14:35). The "wife" helps
"weave" the will and direction of the husband throughout the entire
family. She has been called the emotional "glue" of the family. With her
natural, God-given "weaving" abilities, she has great power to hold her
home together for godliness, and make it a place of refreshment:

Proverbs 14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish
plucketh it down with her hands.

Without appealing to the Scriptures, Schlessinger has defended some of
these things boldly. However, sadly, much of this traditional wisdom will
perhaps be misunderstood by many as the new gleanings of "scientific,
psychological expertise," when just a little over a century ago it was
practically common knowledge. In 1882, the popular book "The Royal Path of
Life" observed the distinctions between men and women:

"Man is bold - woman is beautiful. Man is courageous - woman is timid.
Man labors in the field - woman at home....Man has a daring heart - woman
a tender, loving one....Man has justice - woman has mercy....While man
combats the enemy, struggles with the world, woman is waiting to prepare
his repast and sweeten his existence. He has crosses, and the partner of
his couch is there to soften them....Without woman, man would be rude,
gross, solitary....To feel, to love, to suffer, to devote herself, will
always be the text of the life of woman. Man has a precise and distinct
language, the word being luminous speech....Woman is affectionate and
suffers; she is constantly in need of something to lean upon, like the
honeysuckle upon the tree or fence. Man is attached to the fireside, by
his affection for her, and the happiness it gives him to protect and
support her....No trait of character is more valuable in a female than the
possession of a sweet temper. Home can never be made happy without it. It
is like the flowers that spring up in our pathway, reviving and cheering
us. Let a man go home at night, wearied and worn by the toils of the day,
and how soothing is a word by a good disposition! It is sunshine falling
on his heart....As the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage
about the oak, and been lifted by it in sunshine, will, when the hardy
plant is rived by the thunderbolt, cling round it with its caressing
tendrils, and bind up its shattered boughs. So it is beautifully ordained
that woman, who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in happiest
hours, should be his stay and solace when smitten by sudden calamity. A
woman of true intelligence is a blessing at home, in her circle of
friends, and in society. Wherever she goes, she carries with her a
HEALTHGIVING INFLUENCE....As a nurse, one female will endure more than
five men....Woman equips man for the voyage of life. She is seldom a
leader in any prospect but meets her peculiar and best altitude as a
helper. Though man executes a project, she fits him for it, beginning in
his childhood." (5)

The things that are worthy in Schlessinger's book "Woman Power" are simply
restatements in modern language of some of the things that are stated so
eloquently in the above words from earlier, wiser days. Schlessinger
understands this. She admits that there was a time when earlier
generations did not see men as the evil empire:

"Mothers [in earlier ages] would teach their daughters about 'male ego'
and 'feminine wiles' so that they would be better able to navigate their
journey through marriage and children. Catering to a man was not seen as
diminishing the woman....Times have changed - but the needs of men and
women, and the realities of the masculine-feminine polarity, do not
change." (6)

I commend Schlessinger for the boldness to state clearly that women have
"traded in" their true, God-given power for a power that does not
rightfully belong to them; a masculine power that they can never wield
without hurt to themselves, to their husbands, to their children, and to
society as a whole.

Schlessinger is already being scorned and ridiculed by raging feminists,
even though she has only scratched the surface of true "woman power." She
is a bit gun-shy concerning the word "submit." But the Bible teaches that
the meekness, softness, and reverential obedience can actually "win"
disobedient husbands (1 Peter 3). This is true "power" indeed!

In conclusion, I am thankful for any books that defend the traditional
family wisdom that has been so longed despised by this modern world. We
desparately need to get back to this wisdom, rooted in the Holy
Scriptures:

Proverbs 24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not
with them that are given to change:

Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
for the OLD PATHS, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall
FIND REST for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.
17 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the
trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

And at the very least, perhaps the boldness of "Dr. Laura" will move many
preachers to quit being so mealy-mouthed, and to understand that their
silence is largely to blame for the destruction of homes.

And perhaps she will help many rebellious women, who have fled their
homes, and fled strong churches, and have been slandering pastors who
loved them enough to preach and teach them the truth. Perhap she will help
these women to see that even some non-Christians, without the Bible, have
enough light to see and proclaim that women need to love their husbands,
and love their children, and take some time to take a look at the fact
that they themselves may be guilty of a whole lot of the "emotional abuse"
of which they have spent much of their lives accusing others of heaping on
them. She reproves some women for "marinating" on negatives; for
continually going over a "'bad thing' ad infinitum in their own heads with
their mothers, friends, coworkers, neighbors, social groups [etc.]..." (7)
She reproves these women for desiring strong men (masculine), while at the
same time wanting to control them (weak men). Indeed, it has been my
experience that many women profess to desire and pray for strong, godly
husbands who will be leaders. But when God finally answers their prayers,
they throw contentious fits! But it is impossible to have it both ways.
Strong, godly, Spirit-led men, are not usually apt to be controlled or
hen-pecked in matters of righteousness.

Schlessinger lists some things that are the most hurtful things women can
say or do to men. She writes this list from one husband's point of view:

"Disrespect. Trashing me to her friends... [Saying], 'If you don't _____,
then I'm leaving'....'Placing other things ahead of me...[such as] her
relatives.'....'Always correcting me because I don't say what she thinks I
should have said....Accusing me of being mean when I don't want to do what
she wants....She's never satisfied....I never got the feeling of 'Hello,
this is my husband, and he is enough!'"(8)
 
Lastly, perhaps her books will move many Christians to repent of so-called
"compassionate counseling" that does nothing more than allow young women
to slander, ridicule, insult, despise, and mock their husbands for over an
hour. Such so-called counseling is a great evil (see Psalms 15:3).

A REVIEW OF SCHLESSINGER'S "THE PROPER CARE AND FEEDING OF HUSBANDS," BY
EBBYE FAUST
*********************************************************************
 
Earlier this year Dr. Laura Schlessinger released her book entitled "The
Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands." When I heard about this book, and
knowing a bit about Dr. Laura, I became intrigued and decided to buy it.
Over the years I have read many books by women and men on the subject of
marriage, family, and Godâ€™s ordained role for women.  Being a woman, and a
busy pastor's wife who does much counseling, I have always been greatly
interested in these subjects. Unfortunately, many of the books that I have
read have sadly missed the mark.

I am normally able to pull out a nugget or two of truth out of these
books, but often not much more than that. Yet, I would read on, hoping
that these godly men and women would eventually PLAINLY tell the truth and
write something that would speak to the hearts and minds of the women of
this generation. The women of this generation were trained from their
youngest days not to be mothers to their sweet little babies, but to be
corporate workers, successful in the workplace, while leaving their
children to be raised by hired workers in daycares. They are women who
were not trained to be faithful, single-hearted wives with the desire to
bless their households and to do all in their power to help make their
husbands great men of God, and to fulfill his vision for his life. They
are women who were trained to seek out a vision for themselves, to be in a
"partnership" marriage. They have not been given one ounce of training in
what their role in marriage really is, and how to make it work. Where is
the teaching to THESE women?

Fast forward to an evening when all my children were in bed, and with a
hot cup of herbal tea at my side, I began to read Dr. Laura's book.  I did
know that this was not a Christian writer, and I knew that I would
disagree with some things that she wrote. I found, unfortunately, (and
unnecessarily) more than one curse word in the book. But as I read, I sat
ashamed. Ashamed of the soft, fluffy, afraid-to-be-offensive preaching and
teaching of Christian pastors in our generation. Pastors who have it in
their power to change the backslidden position in their churchesâ€¦ and yet
they refuse to do so!  They have the ability to save marriages and
families, yet, not wanting to "offend," they will not do it.

I was amazed at the absolute respect and honor that Dr. Laura gave to men.
In most books that I have read (even Christian women's books), men were
laughed at, picked at, and made fun of. In Dr. Laura's book, I couldn't
find one place where she did this, or made fun of their needs. She plainly
and firmly wrote about the wrongness of women manipulating their husbands
by whining and nagging, of their selfishness of not giving of themselves
in the marriage bed, and women's frequent disregard of men's feelings
because they aren't expressed the same way a woman would express them.  I
was shocked when I read the title of chapter seven; "A Man Should Be
Respected in His Own Home."

It is obvious why feminists have cried out against this book, and it is
also obvious to me why the strong and godly men of this generation should
hang their heads down in shame that they havenâ€™t been saying these things
all along.

In her opening paragraph in chapter one, Dr. Laura says:

"There isn't a day that goes by when I don't ask at least one woman caller
on my radio program if she expects to stay married considering her
hostile, dismissive, or undermining attitude and actions toward her
husband. What is amazing is how surprised they all seem to imagine that
their husbands might have a limit to how much they'll take before they
tune out or tune away.  What is even more amazing is that this
insensitivity to their husbands' needs and feelings goes hand in hand with
a hypersensitivity about any action or reaction from the men - reactions
that are usually more than reasonable."

On page three, in speaking about the self-centeredness of women, she says:

"And what is the source of this self-centeredness? I believe it's a result
of the women's movement, with its condemnation of just about everything
male as evil, stupid, and oppressive, and the denigration of female and
male roles in families, as well as the loss of family functioning as a
result of divorce, day care, dual careers, and the glorification of
shacking up and unwed motherhood by choice. These are the core destructive
influences that result in women not appreciating that they are perfected,
as are men, when they are bonded in wedlock and have obligations to
family."

In speaking against the feminist movement she says:

"Thisâ€¦ is the ugly part of the feminist movement, which supports personal
success, acquisition, accomplishment, power, and the feminist political
agenda over love, marriage, and family." (pp. 20)

Dr. Laura speaks against women leaving young children in order to have a
career, as well as putting career before family. On page 22, she states:

"And so the women who choose to focus their lives on family are
marginalized, while the women who choose to 'have it all' end up with
Hurried Woman Syndrome. Generally, the HWS women do not treat their
children or husbands well at all. Why? Because when you're tired and
stressed out by the requirements of a job you must fulfill (or risk being
fired), you tend to make everyone else pay the price (even strangers in
traffic) because you have nothing else to give."

She later states on page 23:

"Many married women with children are wearing themselves down to the point
that ill health and ill temper are the result. The problem is not with the
demands of their husbands and children; the problem is with their notion
of a full life. 'Having it all' begins to approximate a 'jack of all
trades and a master of none.' It is also a self-perpetuating trap. If the
work is demanding and draining, and your time is limited and your temper
isn't, guilt usually drives one toward more activity for children to 'make
up' for the neglect and mistreatmentâ€¦ And since the husband is an adult,
he's just left to his own devices or attacked as a nuisance for his
reasonable expectations for a love life and a home life. I get too many
calls from women complaining that their husbands' unreasonable, selfish,
insensitive, and annoying demands on a 'tired woman' amount to mental
abuse!  Oh, Please!"

In her chapter on nagging, she states:

"I'm convinced that too many wives don't know what to do or how to
communicate if they're not complaining, nagging, or criticizing....I often
get calls from women who complain about losing that lovin' feeling. They,
of course, imagine it's because something is missing from their guy. Turns
out that more often than not, though, they've been stomping on their own
loving feelings with their mistreatment of their men. Imagine that. I am
often struck by the pettiness of the complaining, and by the complete
inability to see another way of handling a situation. Too often the
negative perception that seems to always pop up first ends up dominating
all emotion and reason."(pp. 41 49)

Dr. Laura writes on the importance of the marriage bed. On page 120 she
writes:

"It's worrisome when women embrace the notion that once they are married,
they are entitled to be loved, adored, protected, gifted, romanced,
obeyed, and provided for without question, without reciprocation, and
definitely without any effort on their part to create the emotional and
psychological environment that would more than likely get them all those
desires."

On page 121 she writes:

"What attracts men to women is their femininity, and femininity isn't only
about appearance, it's also about behaviors. Looking womanly and behaving
sweetly and flirtatiously are gifts that wives give to their
husbands....It ought to seem obvious that when you love someone, you aim
to please them and make them feel loved and contribute to their happiness.
One listener, Michele, was quite blunt about this by saying that although
she may not always be 'in the mood,' she is always ready..." (pp. 135)

In the second to last chapter, Dr. Laura says:

"Men rescue, repair, provide, protect. Men don't sit, stew, and rehash.
Men are active and proactive. They do that out of love, duty,
responsibility, and character. That needs to be respected and appreciated
if a woman is to have a happy life married to a good man." (pp. 164)

Then she writes:

"As long as women disrespect what they have to offer as wives and mothers,
they will continue to disrespect their men who serve as husbands and
fathers. No one benefits. No one is happy." (pp. 170)

Although there was plenty for a fundamental Christian to disagree with in
this book, there was also plenty to praise. If all of the pulpits in
America would be as strong as Dr. Laura is in this book in regard to the
wive's treatment of their husbands, Christian marriages would be changed.
Are you not tired of the enemy blaspheming the Lord for all of the failed
marriages? Then stand up and TEACH, train, and help young wives to have
happy, fulfilled, and experience holy marriages in the Lord.

THE ANTI-CATHOLICISM OF AMERICA'S FOUNDING FATHERS
By Joey Faust
************************************************************

Alan Dershowitz (Felix Franfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School) has written a new book titled, "Blasphemy: How the Religious Right is Hijacking Our Declaration of Independence," (2007). Dershowitz is not a Christian. His book contains much error and confusion. However, Dershowitz does correctly reveal the anti-Catholicism of most of the founding fathers. He uses this historical information to oppose Catholics such as Alan Keyes, and others who he believes are attempting to "restore" a Christianized America. Dershowitz is apparently blind to all the ways that his religious humanism has hijacked the country. Nevertheless, I stand with my Baptist forefathers (who God used to give us religious liberty in America) in opposing a state funded and authorized "church" (and especially a Catholic ruled state-church). Dershowitz, by calling the anti-Catholicism of the founding fathers "bigotry," is aiding in establishing in America the very thing he professes to be against. Th!

 e anti-Catholicism of the founding fathers was manly, prudent and necessary. But the effeminate, humanistic view of toleration (to the point of absurdity) gives Catholicism a free pass to bring about its long stated goals in America. The fear of Catholicism helped establish the religion of humanism in America (through public education), and this very humanism (with its politically correct rules against any form of discrimination) is presently establishing Catholicism! They will work together, with Catholicism ultimately holding the reins of manipulation, until the Satanic, humanistic, state beast destroys Rome (Revelation 17:16).

Dershowitz appeared on CNN with Lou Dobbs (June 16, 2007). Notice the words of Dershowitz in the following transcript:

DERSHOWITZ: "...the founders were virulently anti-Catholic...But we're not a Christian nation. And if we are a Christian nation, we're a Protestant nation, not a Catholic nation and that's important because our founders were virulently anti-Catholic. Jefferson and Adams wrote to each other..."

DOBBS: "Let me ask you this."

DERSHOWITZ: "...if only we could keep the Jesuits out. Bigotry, the worst form of bigotry."

(http://transcripts.cnn.com/Transcripts/0706/16/ldtw.01.html)

"Bigotry" refers to unreasonable or blind attachment to a creed or opinion. Dershowitz is the one manifesting bigotry. He is so zealously attached to his humanism that he ignores a millennium of Catholic persecution and bloodshed, and he appears to have done practically no research into the reasons the founding fathers had for their anti-Catholicism. He is the one who is therefore guilty of holding a prejudiced opinion. He has "pre-judged" these men in history without even reading the plans and intentions of Catholic leaders in that age! This humanistic, blind, bigotry is one of the chief reasons that America is presently being handed over to Rome through illegal immigration, etc. Therefore, as America celebrates Independence Day, Christians should be praying for a return to the manly spirit of the founders; they did not surrender their common sense to political correctness in their quest for liberty.

The book "Catholic America" (Cogley, 1973), and other works, document that one of the primary reasons for the American Revolution was to keep the colonies from being controlled by Catholicism. Indeed, Alexander Hamilton published papers decrying the Quebec Act (1774) as 'establishing arbitrary power and Popery' in Canada:

"...they may as well establish Popery in New York and the other colonies as they did in Canada. They had no right to do it there than here. Your lives, your property, your religion, are all at stake." ("Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress")

This was enough to incite common farmers to many zeal to defend their liberties. (See  Charles Metzger's, "The Quebec Act: A Primary Cause of the American Revolution," 1936)

Dershowitz, without citing the historical justifications, likewise reveals some of the anti-Catholicism of the founders:

"In an 1826 letter...Jefferson explained that he intended the words of the Declaration to be 'to the world...the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which MONKISH ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves...'...how important it is to remain inspired by the revolutionary spirit that animated these powerful words and ideas." ("Blasphemy," p.9)

 
The "revolutionary spirit" (unlike Dershowitz) was not afraid to call a spade a spade. Jefferson (though apparently not a Christian), nevertheless, understood the practical dangers of "monkish" Catholicism to the cause of liberty in the United States.

Dershowitz quotes historian Pauline Maier as noting:

"...most American revolutionaries were suspicious of Roman Catholicism and its iconographic traditions." (p.15).

Later, Dershowitz quotes some letters of John Adams (1735-1826) to Thomas Jefferson, wherein the dangers of Roman Catholicism are privately mentioned. Dershowitz, again, in his bigotry, labels this prudence of John Adams as "bigotry." Adams (on May 5, 1816) writes:

"I do not like the reappearance of the Jesuits...Shall we not have regular swarms of them here, in as many disguises as only a king of the gypsies can assume, dressed as printers, publishers, writers and schoolmasters? If ever there was a body of men who merited damnation on earth and in Hell, it is this society of Loyola's. Nevertheless, we are compelled by our system of religious toleration to offer them an asylum.'" (p.60)

There are other letters (not listed by Dershowitz) that contain similar warnings by Adams:

"Do you think a Protestant Popedom is annihilated in America? Do you recollect, or have you ever attended to the ecclesiastical Strifes in Maryland Pennsilvania, New York, and every part of New England? What a mercy it is that these People cannot whip and crop, and pillory and roast, AS YET in the U.S.! If they could they wouldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Do you know that The General of the Jesuits and consequently all his Hosts have their Eyes on this Country?"

(Letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 18, 1817)

The "yet" is getting closer than many realize. Notice another letter by Adams:

"Can a free government possibly exist with the Roman Catholic religion?"
(Letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 19, 1821)

Dershowitz continues:

"Adams characterized Catholicism as 'fraudulent' and having inflicted a mortal wound on Christianity. Finally, he asked Jefferson, rhetorically, 'Can a free government possibly exist with the Roman Catholic religion?'" (p.60).

Such crucial questions have not become outdated.

Samuel Adams, in his, "Report of the Committee of Correspondence to the Boston Town Meeting"(Nov. 20, 1772) calls attention to the dangers of granting toleration to enemies of freedom:

"In regard to religion, mutual toleration in the different professions thereof is what all good and candid minds in all ages have ever practised, and, both by precept and example, inculcated on mankind...Insomuch that Mr. Locke has asserted and proved, beyond the possibility of contradiction on any solid ground, that such toleration ought to be extended to ALL WHOSE DOCTRINES ARE NOT SUBVERSIVE OF SOCIETY...The only sects which he thinks ought to be, and which by all wise laws are excluded from such toleration, are those who teach doctrines subversive of the civil government under which they live. THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OR PAPISTS ARE EXCLUDED BY REASON OF SUCH DOCTRINES AS THESE, that princes excommunicated may be deposed, and those that they call heretics may be destroyed without mercy; besides their recognizing the Pope in so absolute a manner, in subversion of government, by introducing, as far as possible into the states under whose protection they enjoy life, liberty, and!

  property, that solecism in politics, imperium in imperio, leading directly to the worst anarchy and confusion, civil discord, war, and bloodshed...By the act of the British Parliament, commonly called the Toleration Act, every subject in England, except Papists, &c., was restored to, and re-established in, his natural right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. And, by the charter of this Province, it is granted, ordained, and established (that is, declared as an original right) that there shall be liberty of conscience allowed in the worship of God to all Christians, except Papists, inhabiting, or which shall inhabit or be resident within, such Province or Territory..."

(http://history.hanover.edu/texts/adamss.html)
 
It is blind bigotry in Dershowitz, as a Harvard lawyer, to fail to research the justifications our founders had for being wary of Rome. They were very open about their hatred of our Constitution, not long after the Revolution. In the 19th century, Baptist writer, John Dowling proved that Popery was not changed. He quotes an Encyclical from Pope Gregory XVI, in 1832, which states:

"From that polluted fountain of indifference flows that absurd and erroneous doctrine, or rather raving, in favor and in defense of 'liberty of conscience,' for which most pestilential error, the course is opened by that entire and wild liberty of opinion which is everywhere attempting the overthrow of civil and religious institutions....hence, in one word, that PEST OF ALL OTHERS most to be dreaded in a state, UNBRIDLED LIBERTY OF OPINION....Nor can we augur more consoling consequences to religion and to government, from the zeal of some to SEPARATE THE CHURCH FROM THE STATE, and to burst the bond which unites the priesthood of the empire. For it is clear that this union is dreaded by the PROFANE LOVERS OF LIBERTY, only because it has never failed to confer prosperity on both.....Hither tends that worst and never sufficiently to execrated and detested LIBERTY OF THE PRESS for the diffusion of all manner of writings, which some so loudly contend for and so actively promote."

(John Dowling, "History of Romanism," 1881)

The same Popish hatred of liberty is revealed a few decades later:

"In the Encyclical and the Syllabus of 1864, the Pope denounces some of the dearest rights of man, because they are opposed to Romish absolutism....With fearful epithets the Pope denounces those who insist that governments should not inflict penalties upon such as violate the Catholic religion...[He] then proceeds to visit with his fiercest malediction, first, THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS; second, or the LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE and of worship; third, or the liberty of speech....seventh, those who declare that the church may not employ force....sixteenth, or that any other religion than the Roman religion may be established by the state; seventeenth, or that in countries called Catholic, the free exercise of other religions may be laudably allowed....Do you not see, that almost everything we hold dear is here assailed? You are accursed of Rome who maintain liberty of conscience and free worship, as do all Protestants of whom I have knowledge....this is the author!

 ity which all Romanists are bound to obey under penalty of being denounced as heretics....Cardinal McCloskey, who as Cardinal of Rome is a foreign prince exercising authority in the United States, contrary to the Constitution and the laws, says: 'The Catholics of the United States are as strongly devoted to the sustenance and maintenance of the temporal power of the Holy Father as Catholics in any part of the world, and if it should be necessary to prove it by acts, they are ready to do so.'....Father Hecker says, that ere long there is to be a state religion in this country [U.S.], and that state religion is to be Roman Catholic.' The Boston 'Pilot' says: 'The man today is living who will see the majority of the people of the American continent Roman Catholics.'"

(Isaac J. Lansing, "Romanism and the Republic," 1890)
       
"On December 8, 1864, Pius IX issued the encyclical Quanta Cura, containing a 'Syllabus of Errors,' not Roman errors, of course, but a vitriolic condemnation of all modernity....Here are a few of Pius IX's own words: 15. No man is free to embrace and profess that religion which he believes to be true, guided by the light of reason....24. The [Roman] Church has the power of employing force and of exercising direct and indirect temporal power....54. Kings and Princes are not only NOT exempt from jurisdiction of the [Roman] Church, but are subordinate to the Church in litigated questions of jurisdiction. 55. The [Roman] Church ought to be in union with the State, and the State with the [Roman] Church....77. It is necessary even in the present day that the [Roman] Catholic religion shall be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship.' Six years later, after Pius IX had rigged the first Vatican Council so that it would officially declar!

 e him infallible, William Gladstone, Prime Minister of England, wrote a pamphlet titled, 'The Vatican Decrees and Their Bearing on Civil Allegiance after 1870.' In his pamphlet Gladstone wrote: 'With this decree, the claims of Innocent III over mankind have BEEN RESURRECTED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY - LIKE SOME MUMMY PICKED OUT OF ITS DUSTY SARCOPHAGUS.'" (John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.144)

Again, Robbins documents that the Popes vowed never to cease contending AGAINST AMERICAN LIBERTY!:

"The Roman Church-State denounced equality before the law, for the simple reason that no other society on Earth is in fact its equal. Leo XII wrote: 'The cause of all these evils lies principally in this: that men have despised and rejected the holy and august authority of the [Roman] Church....We declare THAT WE SHALL NEVER CEASE TO CONTEND FOR THE FULL OBEDIENCE TO OUR AUTHORITY, FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL OBSTACLES PUT IN THE WAY OF OUR FULL EXERCISE OF OUR MINISTRY AND POWER, and for the RESTORATION to that condition of things in which the provident design of the Divine Wisdom HAD FORMERLY PLACED THE ROMAN PONTIFF...'

(Leo XIII, quoted by John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.146)

Samuel F.B. Morse was therefore correct when he warned:

"The Papacy is a political system, despotic in its organization, anti-Democratic and anti-Republican, and cannot therefore exist with American Republicanism."

Don W. Hillis, in 1959, warned that Christians would be blinded by party politics into welcoming Roman Catholicism as a Trojan horse:

"It is an obvious fact that many Protestants are first Republican or Democrats and then Christians. Party politics come first and then ChristianityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦This is the attitude - 'If I am a Republican, then I am going to vote a straight Republican ticket regardless of the fact that there are men running for office on my ticket who are unqualified'Ã¢â‚¬Â¦The prophets of old openly rebuked unqualified candidates and unworthy rulersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦It was this same spirit that brought about the Reformation and even the American RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦If the United States is to escape the bondage of Catholicism, then every true Christian should put up a strong defense and a forthright offense."

(Hillis, "If America Elects a Catholic President, 1959)

Most Christians today have been indoctrinated into humanistic view of toleration by Hollywood and public education. For this reason, Catholics have gained so much ground that they can now be bolder. The editors of "The National Catholic Register" (May, 2007) boast:

"Catholics will dominate in the future of America because of their sheer numbers. Immigration from Mexico and family sizes mean the old Protestant America is throwing itself off a demographic cliff. Tomorrow's America will be far less Protestant and far more Catholic...Christ founded one Church, not many denominations..."

In July, 2000, I preached:

"...there can truly be no celebration of our liberty without a memorial of the patriotism that obtained it...How quickly men forget, and grow complacent, thinking that such freedoms are guaranteed, or that there is no moral responsibility to keep them secure."

(Sermon, "The Christian Patriot")

In July, 2001, I preached:

"More than one in five American teen-agers haven't the foggiest idea what Independence Day means, and flunked a simple fourth-grade-level quiz about it. More than five million U.S. teenagers don't understand the true meaning of Independence Day. Of the teens quizzed, 22 percent didn't know from what country America declared independence during the Revolutionary War."

Let us repent for not using the "open door" of liberty that God graciously gave us in America. And let us pray that God will not close it. Judgment will begin a the house of God. Awake saints of the Lord! Awake pastors. It is later than you think.

*****************************************************************
BAPTIST VIEWS: THE FOUNDATION FOR AMERICAN LIBERTY
*****************************************************************

The common young person on the street has been indoctrinated into thinking that Baptists are against liberty of conscience, politically. It is therefore important that we keep the following history of liberty alive.

John Robinson (the pilgrim father), argued that the state had the right to punish certain religious actions, such a idolatry:

"...to punish civilly, religious actions...he being the preserver of both tables and so to punish all branches of both...[to] by compulsion, repress public and notable idolatry."

(John Robinson)

Smyth, a Baptist, countered this common view:

"...the magistrate is not by virtue of his office to meddle with religion, or matters of conscience, to force or compel men to this or that form of religion, or doctrine: but to leave Christian religion free, to every man's conscience...for Christ only is the king, and lawgiver of the church and conscience (James 4:12)."

(John Smyth, "Propositions and Conclusions," 1611)

Baptist writer, Busher, continued these arguments in 1614:

"...as kings and bishops cannot command the wind, so they cannot command faith....IT IS NOT ONLY UNMERCIFUL, BUT UNNATURAL AND ABOMINABLE; YEA, MONSTROUS FOR ONE CHRISTIAN TO VEX AND DESTROY ANOTHER FOR DIFFERENCE AND QUESTIONS OF RELIGION."

(Leonard Busher, "Religion's Peace: A Plea for Liberty of Conscience," 1614)

In the New World, the first Baptist preacher, John Clarke argued:

"We find the primitive Christians were meek, and gentle, and yet able by sound doctrine both to exhort, and convince the gainsayers, who called not for carnal weapons...but declared their weapons were mighty through God, and either by the word and a good conversation won men to the acknowledgement of the truth as it is in Jesus, or else left them without excuse together with the world, unto the judgment of the great day of the Lord...I testify that no servant of Christ Jesus hath any liberty, much less authority from His Lord to smite his fellowservant...It is not the will of the Lord that one should have dominion over another man's conscience..."

(John Clark, "Ill Newes From New England," 1652)

The Baptists continued this push for religious liberty, until they gained their trophy from the Lord:

"Freedom of conscience, unlimited freedom of mind, was from the first the trophy of the Baptists."
(George Bancroft, History of the United States, 1840)

"At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, all persecution for religious opinions was forever blotted from the statute books, and almost by the end of that struggle, the last vestige of the union of Church and State, or the compulsory support of religion, was chiefly through the influence of the Baptists, abolished..."

(Thomas F. Curtis, "The Progress of Baptist Principles," 1855)

These important principles are usually credited to John Locke. But Locke himself wrote:

"The Baptists were the first propounders of absolute liberty, just and true liberty, equal and impartial liberty."
(John Locke)

"Congress declared the first amendment to the Constitution to be in force December 15, 1791, which granted religious liberty to all citizens; Baptists are credited with being the leaders in bringing this blessing to the nation."

(J.M. Carroll, "The Trail of Blood")

Baptist organizer, Isaac Backus (1724-1806), wrote "An Appeal to the Public for Religious Liberty," in 1773. This appeal by the Baptists was put on hold until after the Revolution:

"On reading the memorial of the Rev. Isaac Backus, agent to the Baptist Churches in this Government, Resolved, That the establishment of civil and religious liberty to each denomination in the province is the sincere wish of this Congress; but being by no means vested with the powers of civil government, whereby they can redress the grievances of any person whatever, they therefore recommend to the Baptist Churches that when a general Assembly shall be convened in this Colony, they lay the real grievances of said churches before the same... By order of the Congress, John Hancock, President."

In 1774, Baptists appealed to George Washington. This action later led to the establishment of the First Amendment:

"[We]...fear that our religious rights were not well secured in our new Constitution of government."

Therefore, when people view Baptists as being "intolerant," they should realize that their freedom to make such views known was given to them by God through the views and appeals of Baptists!

It should also be remembered that "Baptist" was a name given to Christians who did not believe in infant sprinkling or state-churches (just as the name "Christian" was given to the saints by their enemies in Antioch). We wear the reproach as an honor today. It was said in the early colonies that you could not pass one of these "Baptists" on the road without him giving you a Gospel tract or speaking to you about Jesus. May America be filled with such "Baptists" again!

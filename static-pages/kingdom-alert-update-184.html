RELIGIOUS HUMANISM: THE MIDDLE ROAD TO HELL

Luke 23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

Fundamental atheism and fundamental Christianity are diametrically opposed. But the new religion of the last days will be a combination of these two worldviews. The churches are becoming worldly and secularized; at the same time, materialistic, naturalistic atheism is becoming mystical and religious. This leaves the MIDDLE ROAD between the two to be the new religion of the last days that will prepare the world for the Antichrist. The unpardonable sin in this new religious humanism (which is neither fundamental Christianity or die-hard atheism but an amalgamation of the two) is doctrinal conviction based on God's written revelation in the Holy Bible. Doctrine is seen as ignorant superstition. Literal interpretation of Scripture is viewed as a symptom of mental illness. All absolutes, even absolute atheism, are frowned upon. The only absolute that is tolerated is the dogmatic teaching that it is mental illness and superstition to hold to any absolutes not approved by the religious humanists.

Americans have been indoctrinated into this new religion through public education (primarily through the social study departments) since the 1940's. This is the reason that so many churches now feel they must avoid fundamental Bible doctrine and instead focus on THIS LIFE in order to "relate" to the religious humanists. Even "conservative" talk radio must market its ideas with rock music or death metal music (the opposite of all they profess to stand for). Although there are many flavors, the religious humanists often approve of church attendance (as long as the church focuses on the "here and now" and is not "dogmatic" concerning literal interpretation, etc.). Instead of surrendering to this "new" religion for the sake of numbers, fundamental Christians must join together to oppose it head-on.

The Devil obviously understands the principles of Ju Jitsu wherein the force and speed of an opponent's assault is used against him. The Devil raised up militant, materialistic atheism as the great enemy in the middle of the 19th century (and again shortly in the 1960's and 70's), only to quickly change directions and meet in the middle (where he wanted the Christians in the first place). But our Lord Jesus Christ is no more pleased with a secularized Christianity than He is with a "Christianized" humanism:

Revelation 3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods...

It is not necessary to document in detail the fact that much of Christianity is becoming secularized. It is obvious. The following excerpts from an article on the front page of the "Los Angeles Times" says it all:

"Hold the Fire and Brimstone; Mention of hell from pulpits is at an all-time low. The downplaying of damnation shows the influence of secularism on Christian theology - Bill Faris believes in hell...But you'd never know it listening to him preach at his south Orange County evangelical church. He never mentions the topic; his flock shows little interest in it. 'It isn't sexy enough anymore,' said Faris, pastor of Crown Valley Vineyard Christian Fellowship. In churches across America, hell is being frozen out...'There has been a shift in religion from focusing on what happens in the next life to asking, 'What is the quality of this life we're leading now?' said Harvey Cox Jr....professor at the Harvard Divinity School. Hell's fall from fashion indicates how key portions of Christian theology have been influenced by a secular society...The rise of psychology, the philosophy of existentialism and the consumer culture have all dumped buckets of water on hell....'It's just too negative,' said Bruce Shelley, a senior professor of church history at the Denver Theological Seminary....Where once hell was viewed as a literal, geographic location, it is more often seen now as a state of the soul....Perhaps more than any other pastor, the Rev. Robert H. Schuller is credited with inspiring the movement to supplant hell with feel- good messages..."
("The Los Angeles Times"; June 19, 2002)

This mixture of secular, humanistic rebellion with Christianity is not new. It is only more common today. The seeds have become trees. When the fable of evolution was promoted in 1859, it brought with it a new breed of secular-humanized Christians:

"....celebrity freethinkers as Mark Twain and Robert G. Ingersoll brought elements of humanist philosophy even to mainline Christian churches, which became more concerned with this world, less with the next..."
(Council For Secular Humanism, Secularhumanism.org)

19th century occultists taught that the 20th century would be the birth of their new era. In 1902, psychologist William James praised the new breed of Christianity (i.e. religious humanism) that was gaining ground:

"The advance of liberalism, so-called, in Christianity, during the past fifty years, may fairly be called a victory of HEALTHY-MINDEDNESS within the church over the morbidness with which the old hell-fire theology was more harmoniously related. We have now whole congregations whose preachers, far from magnifying our consciousness of sin, seem rather devoted to making little of it. They ignore, or even deny, eternal punishment, and insist on the dignity rather than on the depravity of man. They look at the continual preoccupation of the old-fashioned Christian with the salvation of his soul as something sickly...The persons to whom I refer have still retained for the most part their nominal connection with Christianity..."
(William James, "The Varieties of Religious Experience," p.87-88)

And we wonder what is wrong today in 2002! In 1901, the basic beliefs of fundamental Christianity were already being called "old-fashioned." But as the churches were surrendering and moving toward the middle of the road (to Hell), the Devil also had a plan for militant atheism.

The father of the prodigal son came running out to meet him on his return (Luke 15:20). In the same manner, if we draw nigh unto God, He will draw nigh unto us (James 4:8). However, the same thing is also true of the Devil! Satan will always meet us half-way when we move in his direction (Proverbs 7:10,13). As much of Christendom was becoming secularized at the turn of the 20th century, secularism was rapidly becoming RELIGIOUS (there was already only a minor gap to bridge between many of the materialists who "investigated" the "supernatural" and the occult spiritists who religiously embraced it).

For example, John Dewey (1859-1952) was a Socialist. He is called the father of modern American Education. He founded the Progressive Education Association in 1919. Its aim was to reform the whole school system. He penned the Humanist Manifesto in 1933. The same year, he also became president of the National Education Association. The next year (1934), he published "A Common Faith." He is responsible for the radical change in textbooks, and the "Social Study" departments in public schools. In "A Common Faith" (notice the title!), Dewey wrote:

"Never before in history has mankind been so much divided into two camps, as it is today. Religions have traditionally been allied with ideas of the supernatural...The opposed group consists of those who think the advance of culture and science has completely discredited the supernatural and with it all religions....I shall develop ANOTHER CONCEPTION of the nature of the RELIGIOUS phase of experience, one that separates it from the supernatural....It goes contrary to the traditional religions....[While] from the other side [militant atheism], the position I am taking seems like a timid halfway position....It demands that in imagination we wipe the slate clean and start afresh by asking what would be the idea of the unseen...if whatever is basically religious in experience had the opportunity to express itself free from all historic encumbrances [i.e. fundamental Christian doctrine]...faith in the possibilities of continued and rigorous inquiry [i.e. Dewey's new religion] does not limit access to truth....There is such a thing as faith in intelligence [Dewey's new religion] becoming religious in quality...The opposition between religious values as I conceive them [Dewey's new secular religion] and religions [true, fundamental Christianity] is not to be bridged...their identification [Dewey's RELIGIOUS values] with the creeds and cults of religions must be dissolved....Militant atheism is...affected by lack of natural piety...A religious attitude, however, needs the sense of a connection of man...with the enveloping world that the imagination feels is a universe...The 'divine' is thus a term of human choice and aspiration."

In the above excerpt you have the new religion that has been taught in public schools since the 1940's. It is not opposed to "religion." That is just a smokescreen. It is opposed to FUNDAMENTALISM! When two adversaries come to an agreement, they compromise in the middle. Do we desire radical, materialistic atheism to be taught in schools? No. But the Devil is happy to settle for Christian children bowing their heads in prayer, as they sit under a constant indoctrination against FUNDAMENTALISM (while on psychiatric drugs). The new religious humanists wanted a religion that was more in touch with nature than materialistic, naturalistic atheism. In this new secularized Christianity (or Christianized humanism), the child is taught to worship a continual "rigorous inquiry," which ABHORS any absolutes based on a literal interpretation of the Bible.

Since the 1940's, religious humanists have largely succeeded in converting an entire nation! How did they do it? First, it is EASY to tempt people to live by sight and walk in the flesh. John Lennon (the blasphemous Beatle) recognized this when he summed up the philosophy of the new age:

"Imagine there's no Heaven. IT'S EASY IF YOU TRY. No Hell below us. Above us only sky. Imagine all the people, Living for today....You, you may say I am a dreamer. But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will be as one."

How did they convert a whole nation? Christians surrendered their children to be indoctrinated in the public schools controlled by religious humanists. They felt that as long as PRAYER was said in school, that the children would not be harmed. They did not realize that the humanist educators and psychologists (Fromm, etc.) "approved" of "religion"! They were not against "religion," or even "Christianity." The men who took over public education were steeped in liberal UNITARIAN thought. They were against FUNDAMENTALISM! They were against the teaching that Jesus is the only way to salvation, that all men are sinners, that the penalty for sin is eternal torment, that the Bible is the inspired and only Word of God, that Genesis is to be interpreted literally, that there are God-given distinctions and roles between the sexes, that every other religion except true, fundamental Christianity is false and Satanic, that values and morality are to be derived from interpreting the Bible literally, and that Jesus is soon to come again to judge the world and reign on earth. To the religious humanists, the above beliefs are a symptom of mental illness and superstition and they think it is their DUTY to save the children from parents who teach these beliefs to their children. Notice the words of a modern humanist:

"I think that the most important factor moving us toward a secular society has been the educational factor. Our schools may not teach Johnny to read properly, but the fact that Johnny is in school until he is sixteen tends to lead toward the elimination of religious SUPERSTITION."
(Paul Blanshard, "Three Cheers for Our Secular State," "The Humanist," 1976)

It is not the removal of "religion" or even nominal Christianity that is the TRUE goal. It is the eradication of "superstition," which is a word humanists have used since the 19th century to describe what is now known as Christian fundamentalism!

There is certainly more to all of this. But this should be enough to document that the goal of the Devil is not to rid the world of "Christianity." He is striving to rid the world of FUNDAMENTALISM! And sadly, his chief weapon has been the passivity and sleepy drunkenness of fundamental Christians. They gave the Devil their children for OVER HALF A CENTURY through public education and the entertainment industry:

1 Thessalonians 5:7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
8 But let us, who are of the day, be SOBER...

1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be VIGILANT; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

Let us repent. Let us confess our sins. Let us forsake our sins. And let us protect our children and attack and abhor religious humanism with all our might, by the grace of our Lord Jesus:

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.

=============================================

EXTREMIST, RADICAL FUNDAMENTALISTS

"What is truly ironic is that some EXTREMIST FUNDAMENTALISTS think that the Church since Vatican II has been engaged in a 'diabolical plot' to seduce Protestants into the Church."
("Detection and Overthrow of the 'Traditionalist Catholics' Falsely So-Called: Refutation of Appendix 1," written by I.Shawn McElhinney)

"This is the one question that nobody but the most EXTREMIST FUNDAMENTALISTS (such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson) will certainly ask themselves."
(Cliff Walker, Positive Atheism Magazine)

"...Osama bin Laden does not represent Islam. Instead, he represents a type of movement which is present in virtually every major religious tradition on earth today. In the academic study of religion we call them RADICAL FUNDAMENTALISTS. And whether they are Islamic, Christian, Jewish, or otherwise, radical fundamentalist groups all have some typical characteristics in common. They interpret scripture literally, they isolate themselves from the world, and they harshly condemn anyone who disagrees."
(Dr. Byron McCane, Associate Professor of Religion and Philosophy at Converse College, "Spartanburg Herald Journal," October 14, 2001)

The words "extremist fundamentalist" are somewhat redundant. The word "fundamental" is usually used to distinguish a person, group or belief from those that are liberal or compromised within the same field or religion. In Islam, for example, those that interpret the Koran literally (and therefore kill for their religion) should be seen as "fundamental Muslims." Those that interpret the Koran allegorically should be called "liberal Muslims." There is no need for the word "extremist." The words fundamental, moderate and liberal are sufficient.

In Christianity, the New Testament teaches that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal (2 Corinthians 10:4). Therefore, "fundamental" Christians (those who interpret the Bible using normal or literal interpretation) believe that we are to contend for the faith with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (Ephesians 6:17). The most "extreme" fundamentalists (if we define "extreme" as that which is utmost) believe this teaching.

If we define "extremist" in a more modern sense, as a person who goes beyond what is proper, we must ask why the word "fundamentalist" is attached to it. The man who was accused and executed for the Oklahoma Bombing professed to be a backslidden CATHOLIC and an agnostic humanist! He was not a Christian fundamentalist in any sense. Why then do we continue to see and hear fundamental Christianity linked with fundamental Islam in the news? The implication is that LITERAL INTERPRETATION is dangerous and violent. But this is ludicrous! If fundamental Christians should be likened unto Islamic terrorists simply because they hold to the fundamentals of their religion, then we could make the same claim about those who hold to the "fundamentals" of humanism, liberalism or any other world view. They believe that they are right and that those who disagree are wrong. They will reply that people have used the name of Christianity, like Islam, to kill and silence those who disagree and that therefore the analogy is justified. We reply that people have also used the names of atheism and humanism to kill and silence people and that therefore we are likewise justified in likening "fundamental" humanism or atheism to the Taliban!

Whether or not "fundamentalism" or literal interpretation is dangerous depends upon WHAT is being interpreted. The New Testament LITERALLY condemns murder. It literally condemns the lack of natural affection. Therefore, it is not the FUNDAMENTALIST interpretation of the Bible that is killing thousands of babies in the womb; it is the LIBERAL'S interpretation of Scripture that is used to justify abortion.

We will therefore hold fast the form of sound words. It is obvious that if ordinary conservatives in politics (who are often LIBERAL Christians or even agnostics) are being painted as dangerous and hateful, then fundamental Christians are certainly being vilified! Political conservatives are attempting to defend themselves by loudly proclaiming that they are not "extremist fundamentalists." This phrase (or one similar, such as "radical fundamentalists") is being increasingly used to brand good Christians who interpret the Bible literally and hold to the fundamentals of the faith. It is even being used to describe moderate Christians.

In early Rome, it was widely (though erroneously) believed that Christians were cannibals who ate babies, and were therefore worthy of persecution and death. The same climate is developing with regard to Christian fundamentalists today. The inspired command of Peter is very applicable to us in this mad, modern world:

1 Peter 3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, AS OF EVILDOERS, they may be ashamed that FALSELY ACCUSE your good conversation in Christ.

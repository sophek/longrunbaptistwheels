            CAN GOD BE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN?
Ac 1:3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many INFALLIBLE PROOFS, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:

Recently, I heard WBAP News, 820 AM radio argue that God could not be scientifically proven. The host went on to imply that there was no proof for God's existence. Most of the callers agreed. Everyone took it as self-evident truth that religion is a matter of "faith" or "belief", and that these words do not imply rational evidence. I wonder if they believe they can PROVE their conclusion? If they cannot, why do they believe it? They talked about how people who are uncomfortable with their "faith" must always seek proof in the realm of science, etc. I am by no means
justifying Internet myths or fables that attempt to "prove God". But, on
the other hand, the idea that God cannot be proven to exist is itself a
fable!

A few years back I witnessed to a group of atheists. They stated that
"belief" is in the realm of religion and that they do not hold any
beliefs! I had never heard of such insanity before. Do they not BELIEVE
that God is a myth? They did not like that word "believe". What in the
world is going on with people's minds? Where did all this insanity come from?

To start with, we must realize that language (especially as it relates to
Theology) has degenerated. This has caused much confusion. Notice how
Webster defined the word "faith" in 1828:

1. Belief; the assent of the mind to the truth of what is declared by
another, resting on his authority and veracity, without other evidence...
2. The assent of the mind to the truth of a proposition advanced by
another; belief on probable evidence of any kind.

Even as late as 1956, Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary defines
"faith" as:

1. The assent of the mind to the truth of what is declared by another,
resting on his authority or veracity, without other evidence, or on
probable evidence of any kind...firm and earnest belief, on probable
evidence of any kind..."

Notice how according to older dictionaries, "faith" or "belief" should logically rest on something. This does not mean that it will not be tested by contrary appearances. But faith, to be faith, must hold to past evidence in spite of contrary appearances. Faith that has nothing at all to rest upon used to be called "blind faith" or "superstition"! In fact, Webster's definition of "superstition" in 1828 was "belief without evidence". I by no means hold Webster to be infallible. He is writing over 200 years after the King James Bible has been circulated. However, the point is that older dictionaries are very clear that "faith" is to include
evidence or it is mere superstition. At one time this was generally
understood. For example, notice the following words of Charles Finney
(1792-1895):

"Faith must always have evidence. A man cannot believe a thing, unless he
sees something which he supposes to be evidence. He is under no obligation
to believe, and has no right to believe, a thing will be done, unless he has evidence. It is the height of fanaticism to believe without evidence."

We know we have a good sample of the common Theology in Finney's day in
the above quote since Finney himself was often accused of fanaticism.
Christians therefore used to believe that faith was to be based on
evidence. Many no longer believe this. No wonder Christians are often
powerless to confront this perilous age. They have nothing to offer but
"blind faith" and "feelings".

But what do the MODERN dictionaries teach about "faith"? There has been a
radical change in definition over the years. For example notice the
second definition for "faith" found in the American Heritage Dictionary of
the English Language, Fourth Edition (2000):

2. Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.

Many modern dictionaries list this absurdity as the FIRST definition!

With the help of Hollywood, "belief in God" has been separated from any
kind of validation or evidence of any kind. This is evil. It is a sign of
the last days.

Many people get confused and wonder why faith would have any MORAL
qualities if indeed it is based to be based on evidence. Yet, how is it
moral in any manner to believe something with no evidence at all? Such is willful stupidity. True faith has moral qualities because it resists
contrary feelings and clings to solid evidence. We see this illustrated
when Abraham was told to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham had to resist his
feelings about God and hold to what he knew was true about God. He was
praised by God for doing so.

Does God expect men to believe in Him WITHOUT EVIDENCE? Many people these
days seem to think so. Yet they are only exercising fickle feelings if
they do not know why they believe something to be true.

What evidence has God given us that He exists? The Bible (which is proven
to be true by supernatural prophecy that never errs) tells us that the
creation itself proves God:

Ps 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
his handywork.
2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

Ro 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness;
19 Â¶ Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God
hath shewed it unto them.
20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

These verses are clear. The creation proves that there is a God. To deny
this is to be a fool:

Ps 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God...

Can we therefore prove that God exists? It is already proven! All we must do is call attention to it. Hardened sinners will not be convinced. Yet this is not because there is no proof that there is a God. It is because
they REFUSE to admit the proof is there in their rebellion. And this
brings us to another point. The philosophers who believe in the goodness of man are wrong when they tell us that everyone will believe any true fact once they see the evidence. This fails to recognize that man has a
WILL. This will is able to deny rational evidence and obey passion.
Therefore, many people do not believe in God for moral reasons. They are
rebels. The Bible also says that those the world calls "wise" will often be too proud to believe rational truth:

1Co 1:26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

Can God be SCIENTIFICALLY proven? This of course depends upon one's
definition of "scientific". It might be better to say that God can be
"rationally" or "logically" proven to exist. This keeps us from having to
deal with a hundred different definitions of what is "scientific". Often people mean by "scientific" only what they can observe. They will then point out that they cannot see God and will then proclaim defiantly that "no one can scientifically prove God exists". But can such a person
"scientifically" prove a radio wave exists? What about some of the
subatomic particles? What about the new planets they keep discovering but
have never observed?

There is evidence in the creation that God exists. A creation logically
implies a Creator. Design logically implies a Designer. These truths are
logically self-evident. And I would love to see an infidel scientist
attempt to throw out self-evident, logical truth in an attempt to hold to
"only what can be observed". He would have to throw out the very
mathematics that make his craft possible! And what about truth itself?
Does he hold some things to be true scientifically? Where is this truth?
Can he scientifically observe it? Let such a scientist continue measuring
and never conclude anything. To conclude is to enter the domain of
self-evident science. It is in this domain that the invisible God is
proved to exist based upon the creation and the Holy Scriptures He has inspired and authenticated by supernatural prophecy.

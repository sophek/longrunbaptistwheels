        <h1>FALSE PROPHECIES OF THE WATCHTOWER ORGANIZATION - KAU#157</h1>
        <div id="content">
            EARLY HISTORY OF THE J.W. ORGANIZATION

Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916) founded Zion's Watchtower Tract Society in 1884. He co-authored a book with a Seventh-Day Adventist named N.H. Barbour in 1877. From those early Seventh-Day Adventist roots, one can see where Russell (and later his Watchtower organization under the leadership of Rutherford) received his unbiblical manner of interpreting the prophecies. When Christ did not return on the expected date in 1844, the Seventh-Day Adventists later pretended that He had come (invisible to the eyes of man) in the sanctuary of Heaven to begin an "investigative judgment." C.T. Russell, later (after making his own break with the Seventh-Day Adventists) would write his "Studies In The Scriptures." Volume II of this series was titled "The Time Is At Hand," written in 1889. In amazing arrogance and presumption, he ridiculed the failed predictions of the earlier Adventists (p.31), yet set about to make his own predictions! He taught that the thousand years of Christ's reign began in 1873 with an "invisible" coming of Christ. He predicted that evil men would lose their power in 1914, and at that time the "Kingdom of God" would rule the earth:

"...we present the Bible evidence proving that the full end of the times of the Gentiles, i.e., the full end of their lease of dominion, will be reached in A.D.1914;...that date will see the disintegration of the rule of imperfect men...at that date the Kingdom of God...will begin to assume control...But not until the great day of trouble is about closing - not until the Gentile kingdoms are ground to powder and utterly removed, no place being found for them..." ("The Time Is At Hand," pp.77,141)

Just as the Seventh-Day Adventists before them, the Watchtower organization was not about to give up on the 1914 date. They simply stated that the prophecies were indeed fulfilled in 1914, INVISIBLY in the heavens:

"As one of His witnesses we shall want to tell you about his kingdom that was established in the heavens in the year 1914, when he installed his Son Jesus Christ as King of the new world..." ("From Paradise Lost To Paradise Regained," p.248)

The J.W.'s teach that the ruling body in Brooklyn, N.Y. is the "FAITHFUL SLAVE" of Matthew 24, and that IT alone is GUIDED by GOD in regard to interpreting the Bible. But they can no longer rationally hold that this so-called "faithful slave" is FREE FROM ERROR. The Watchtower organization now ADMITS that "some" of its "Bible students" were wrong for setting dates and making erroneous predictions. This is similar to the Pope asking "forgiveness" for the "children of the church." These cults dance around the fact that the TOP HEIRARCHY of their organizations actually were responsible for the errors! Yet, since the WATCHTOWER organization can be WRONG so many times in regard to Bible PROPHECY (as they admit), then it follows that the organization can be WRONG in regard to other aspects of Theology! If the history of the J.W. organization is littered with ERRORS in regard to Bible prophecy, then it is no great wonder that the history of the same organization would be littered with ERRORS in regard to SALVATION, HELL, THE DEITY OF CHRIST, THE TRINITY, etc.! These questions should be honestly faced by every so-called J.W.

In 2 Timothy 3, we are warned that in the LAST DAYS, the TRUTH of God will be RESISTED in the same way the magicians of Egypt resisted Moses. But how did the magicians resist Moses? Did they resist his works by COUNTERACTING them? No, they did not. They resisted Moses by DUPLICATING his wonders! They helped Moses PLAGUE Egypt:

Exodus 8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

This tempted Pharaoh to harden his heart and conclude that Moses was simply another court magician, using Babylonian sorcery, and that he was no better than his own band of "scientists." However, the magicians could only go so far.

In this day and age, one of the most amazing miracles of God is the ability of the HOLY BIBLE to predict the future without error, 100 % of the time. Therefore, we can expect on the basis of 2 Timothy 3, for the FALSE TEACHERS (who creep into houses and prey upon silly women) to attempt to DUPLICATE the ability of the Bible to predict the future. We can expect Satan to get a FEW right (Ex.8:7). Yet, we will know Satanic power, inspiration or seduction by the fact that these false prophets will only be able to go so far in predicting the future. If DETAILS are missed, or if there is ever a wrong prediction, behind it all is the Devil:

Exodus 8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, BUT THEY COULD NOT: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

2 Timothy 3:8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
9 But THEY SHALL PROCEED NO FURTHER: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, AS THEIRS ALSO WAS.

These false teachers MAY have some amazing "hits" and "successes." But, just as Jannes and Jambres, before long, their folly will be manifested before all who are WILLING to see the truth.

Notice an example. Mormonism began with a prophecy of the Civil War. A Civil War did indeed occur within the time frame predicted. However, it was NOT worldwide, and many DETAILS were NOT fulfilled. And MANY other prophecies were never fulfilled. Mormonism has therefore been exposed as an organization deluded by Satan.

In the same manner, for decades the date 1914 was set before the world by the Watchtower organization as the date when ALL the kingdoms of this world, and all churches, would be overthrown. As in Mormonism, SOMETHING did occur. The first World War began in 1914. Yet, the prophecy was proved to be false.

The sin of setting a date for the Lord's coming (and for the end of the world) is a sin that many zealous believers have committed throughout history. Most have not held any dates with absolute certainty (as the J.W. cult). But what makes the sin of the J.W.'s and Mormons doubly evil, is that they do not simply set a date. They set themselves up as the ONLY INFALLIBLE INTERPRETERS of Scripture, especially GUIDED SUPERNATURALLY by God. When they (or anyone other supposed prophets today) make false predictions, they are immediately exposed as Satanic, and their claims to inspiration and special guidance are proved to be bogus (Deuteronomy 18:22). And we repeat: If the "interpretive body" can be wrong about Bible prophecy, it can be WRONG about other aspects of theology. And the Watchtower organization IS indeed wrong in its teachings concerning the new birth, salvation, Hell, the Deity of Christ, the Trinity, and many other important doctrines.

FALSE PREDICTIONS OF THE WATCHTOWER ORGANIZATION

"People today can view the creative works. They have at hand the Bible, but it is little read or understood. So, does Jehovah have a prophet to help them, to warn them of dangers and to declare things to come? These questions can be answered in the affirmative. Who is this prophet?...He [God] had a 'prophet' to warn them. This 'prophet' was not one man, but was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students. Today, they are known as Jehovah's Christian witnesses....Of course, it is easy to say that this group acts as a 'prophet' of God. It is another thing to prove it. The only way that this can be done is to review the record. What does it show?" (The Watchtower, April 1, 1972, Number 7)

Let us, therefore, "review the record." We will begin in 1880 and work our way through history, documenting the FAILED PREDICTIONS and shipwrecked lives of the J.W.'s:

1880: "We need not here repeat the evidences that the 'seventh trump' began its sounding A.D., 1840, and will continue until the end of the time of trouble, and the end of 'The times of the Gentiles,' A.D., 1914, and that it is the trouble of this 'Great day,' which is here symbolically called the voice of the Archangel when he begins the deliverance of fleshly Israel...Nor will we here, again present the conclusive Bible proof that our Lord came for his Bride in 1874, and has an unseen work as Reaper of the first-fruits of this Gospel Age. ("Zion's Watchtower," November, 1880)

1888: "In this chapter we present the Bible evidence proving that the full end of the times of the Gentiles, i.e., the full end of their lease of dominion, will be reached in A.D. 1914; and that the date will be the FARTHEST LIMIT of the rule of imperfect men. And be it observed, that if this is shown to be a fact firmly established by the Scriptures, it will prove; Firstly, that at that date the Kingdom of God, for which our Lord taught us to pray, saying, Thy Kingdom come, will obtain full, universal control, and that it will then be set
up, or firmly established, in the earth, on the ruins of present institutions." ("The Time Is At Hand," 1888, p. 76, 77)

1889: "Be not surprised, then, when in subsequent chapters we present proofs that the setting up of the Kingdom of God is already begun, that it is pointed out in prophecy as due to begin the exercise of power in A.D. 1878, and that the 'battle of the great day of God Almighty' (Rev. 16:14) which will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth's present rulership, is already commenced." ("Studies in the Scriptures," Vol. 2, "The Time Is At Hand," 1889, p.101.)

1889: "In the coming 26 years, all present governments will be overthrown and dissolved." ("Studies in the Scriptures," Vol. 2, p.98-99, 1889)

1889: "Remember that the forty years' Jewish Harvest ended October A.D. 69, and was followed by the complete overthrow of that nation; and that likewise the forty years of the Gospel age harvest will end October, 1914, and that likewise the overthrow of 'Christendom,' so-called, must be expected to immediately follow." ("Studies in the Scriptures," Vol. 2, p.245)

1894: "...in view of recent labor troubles and threatened anarchy, our readers are writing to know if there may not be a mistake in the 1914 date. They say that they do not see how present conditions can hold out so long under the strain. We see no reason for changing the figures-nor could we change them if we would. They are, we believe, God's dates, not ours. But bear in mind that the end of 1914 is not the date for the beginning, but for the end of the time of trouble." ("Zion's Watchtower, Can It Be Delayed until 1914?," July 15, 1894)

1894: "A few more years will wind up the present order of things, and then the chastened world will stand face to face with the actual conditions of the established Kingdom of God." ("Watchtower," p.56, 1894)

1894: "We see no reason for changing the figures nor could we change them if we would. They are, we believe, Gods dates, not ours. But bear in mind that the end of 1914 is not the date for the beginning, but for the end of the time of trouble." ("Watchtower," July 15, 1894)

1914: "There is absolutely no ground for Bible students to question that the consummation of this Gospel age is now even at the door, and that it will end as the Scriptures foretell in a great time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation. We see the participants in this great crisis banding themselves together" ("Watchtower Reprints," VI, May 1, 1914, p.5450)

1914: "Studying God's Word, we have measured the 2520 years, the seven symbolic times, from that year 606 B.C. and have found that it reached down to October, 1914, as nearly as we were able to reckon. We DID NOT SAY positively that this would be the year." ("Watchtower," November 1, 1914)

1914: "Even if the time of our change should not come within ten years, what more should we ask? Are we not a blessed, happy people? Is not our God faithful? If anyone knows anything better, let him take it. If any of you ever find anything better, we hope you will tell us." ("Watchtower," Dec 15, 1914)

1915: "In view of this strong Bible evidence concerning the Times of the Gentiles, we consider it an established truth that the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the full establishment of the kingdom of God, will be accomplished near the end of A.D. 1915." ("The Time Is At Hand," 1915 edition, p.99)

1916: We see no reason for doubting, therefore, that the Times of the Gentiles ended in October, 1914; and that a few more years will witness their utter collapse and the full establishment of God's kingdom in the hands of Messiah." ("Watchtower Reprints," VI, Sept 1, 1916, p.5950)

1917: "And the mountains were not found. Even the republics will disappear in the fall of 1920. And the mountains were not found. Every kingdom of earth will pass away, be swallowed up in anarchy." ("The Finished Mystery," 1917 edition, p.258)

1917: "There will be no slip-up...Abraham should enter upon the actual possession of his promised inheritance in the year 1925." ("Watchtower," Oct. 15, 1917)

1917: "Also, in the year 1918, when God destroys the churches wholesale and the church members by million, it shall be that any that escape shall come to the works of Pastor Russell to learn the meaning of the downfall of Christianity." ("The Finished Mystery," 1917 edition, p.485)

1918: "Therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old, particularly those named by the Apostle in Hebrews 11, to the condition of human perfection." ("Millions Now Living Will Never Die," p. 89)

["...at that time some of the more mature among the Bible students began to catch on, and to notice the discrepancy in the Society's statements about 1925 being...the end of the present wicked world, and evidence of the Society's increasing activities of buying land, buildings, ordering printing presses, all making for expansion! The two just did not go together." (W.J. Schnell, "Thirty Years A Watchtower Slave," p.34, 1956)]

1922: "The period must end in 1925. The type ending, the antitype must begin; and therefore 1925 is definitely fixed in the scriptures. Every thinking person can see that a great climax is at hand. The Scriptures clearly indicate that the climax is the fall of Satan's empire and the full establishment of the Messianic kingdom. This climax being reached by 1925, and that marking the beginning of the fulfillment of the long promised blessings of life to the people, millions now living on earth will be living then and those who obey the righteous laws of the new arrangement will live forever. Therefore it can be confidently said at this time that millions now living will never die." ("Golden Age," Jan. 4, 1922, p.217)

1923: "1925 is definitely settled by the Scriptures...the Christian has much more upon which to base his faith than Noah had (so far as the Scriptures reveal) upon which to base his faith in the coming deluge." ("Watchtower," April 1, 1923, p.106)

1924: "We cannot be blamed for presenting from the Scriptures such evidence as they afford which leads us to believe that a certain event will take place at a given time. Some times the Lord has let His people looking for the right thing at the wrong time, and more frequently they have looked for the wrong things at the right time. But all the enemies of the cause of present truth in the earth are fervently hoping that the Bible students will not be so successful in 1925 in looking for the right thing at the right time as they were in 1914. if they are, however, it will be the other fellow that will have to do the explaining, and not we." ("The Golden Age," Feb.13, 1924, p.314)

1925: "The year 1925 is here. With great expectation Christians have looked forward to this year. Many have confidently expected that all members of the body of Christ will be changed to heavenly glory during this year. This may be accomplished. It may not be. In his own due time God will accomplish his purposes concerning his people. Christians should not be so deeply concerned about what may transpire this year." ("Watchtower," Jan.1, 1925)

1925: "It is to be expected that Satan will try to inject into the minds of the consecrated, the thought that 1925 should see an end to the work." ("Watchtower," Sept. 1925)

1938: "...mark the words of Jesus, which definitely seem to discourage the bearing of children immediately before or during Armageddon...It would therefore appear that there is no reasonable or scriptural injunction to bring children into the world immediately before Armageddon, where we now are." ("Watchtower," Nov.1, 1938)

1938: "Would it be scripturally proper for them to marry and begin to rear children? No, is the answer, which is supported by the scriptures...I will be far better to be unhampered and without burdens, that they may do the Lords will now, as the Lord commands, and also be without hindrance during Armageddon..." ("Face the Facts," 1938)

1943: "Man cannot by airplane or rockets or other means get above the air envelope which is about our earthly globe..."("The Truth Shall Make You Free," p. 285, 1943 edition)

1958: "Many are the people alive since 1914 who will still be living when it is time for Armageddon to begin." ("From Paradise Lost To Paradise Regained," 1958)

1968: "Although the Kingdom came to power in 1914, Jehovah did not immediately destroy those who were not serving him." ("The Truth That Leads To Eternal Life," 1968)

1971: "Shortly, within our twentieth century, the "battle in the day of Jehovah" will begin against the modern antitype of Jerusalem, Christendom." ("The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah"; 1971; 2nd ed.; p.216)

1982: "Which generation did Jesus mean? He meant the generation of people who were living in 1914. Those persons yet remaining of that generation are now very old. However, some of them will still be alive to see the end of this wicked system. So of this we can be certain: Shortly now there will be a sudden end to all wickedness and wicked people at Armageddon." ("You Can Live Forever In Paradise On Earth," p. 154, 1982)

1984: "And others alive in 1914 are in their 80's or 90's, a few even having reached a hundred. There are still many millions of that generation alive. Some of them 'will by no means pass away until all things occur.'" (Watchtower, 15 May, 1984)

1989: "The apostle Paul was spearheading the Christian missionary activity. He was also laying a foundation for a work that would be completed in our 20th century." ("Watchtower," Jan. 1, 1989)

MORE BACKTRACKING AND COVER UP

1972: "Does this admission of making mistakes stamp them [us!] as false prophets? Not at all, for false prophets do not admit to making mistakes." ("Watchtower," Nov.1, 1972)

1975: "The year 1925 came and went. Jesus' anointed followers were still on earth as a class. The faithful men of old time - Abraham, David and others - had not been resurrected to become princes in the earth. (Ps. 45:16) So, as Anna MacDonald recalls: '1925 was a sad year for many brothers. Some of them were stumbled; their hopes were dashed...Instead of it's being considered a 'probability,' they read into it that it was a 'certainty.' and some prepared for their loved ones with expectations of their resurrection." ("Yearbook," 1975, p.146)

1976: "It may be that some who have been serving God have planned their lives according to a mistaken view of just what was to happen on a certain date or in a certain year. They may have, for this reason, put off or neglected things that they otherwise would have cared for. But they have missed the point of the Bibles warnings concerning the end of this system of things, thinking that Bible chronology reveals the specific date." ("Watchtower," July 15, 1976)

1979: "Because of this hope, the 'faithful and discreet slave' has alerted all of God's people to the sign of the times indicating the nearness of God's Kingdom rule. In this regard, however, it must be observed that this 'faithful and discreet slave' was never inspired, never perfect. Those writings by certain members of the 'slave' class that came to form the Christian part of God's Word were inspired and infallible, but that is not true of other writings since. Things published were not perfect in the days of Charles Taze Russell, first president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society; nor were they perfect in the days of J.F. Rutherford, the succeeding president. The increasing light on God's Word as well as the facts of history have repeatedly required that adjustments of one kind or another be made down to the very present time. But let us never forget that the motives of this 'slave' were always pure, unselfish; at all times it has been well-meaning." ("The Watchtower"; March 1, 1979)

1993: "Further, the widely circulated booklet 'Millions Now Living Will Never Die' presented the view that in 1925, God's purposes regarding the restoring of the earth to Paradise and the resurrecting of the faithful ones of old would begin to be fulfilled...The year 1925 came to its conclusion, but the end was not yet! Ever since the 1870's, Bible Students had been serving with a date in mind - first 1914, then 1925. Now they realized that they must serve for as long as Jehovah wishes." ("Watchtower"; Nov. 1, 1993)

1995: [The generation of Mt. 24] "apparently refers to the peoples of earth (now) who see the sign of Christ's presence but fail to mend their ways." ("Watchtower," November 1, 1995)

TEXT: Song of Solomon 3:7 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are

about it, of the valiant of Israel.

8 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of

fear in the night.

9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf...

of their deeds.

for a covering.

1 Peter 3:4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the

themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands

Proverbs 20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a

precious jewel.

Proverbs 25:12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon

an obedient ear.

1 Corinthians 3:12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones,

wood, hay, stubble;

14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as

by fire.

16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,

which temple ye are.

linen is the righteousness of saints.

Lamb.

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

led away with divers lusts,

Proverbs 7:10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of

heart.

11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,

14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.

17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.

19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

Daniel 5:2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver

no pleasure in him.

of.

2 Corinthians 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to

one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

might well bear with him.

enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto

the humble.

7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify

your hearts, ye double minded.

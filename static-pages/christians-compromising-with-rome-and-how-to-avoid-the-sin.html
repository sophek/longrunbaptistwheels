        <h1>CHRISTIANS COMPROMISING WITH ROME AND HOW TO AVOID THE SIN - KAU#094</h1>
        <div id="content">
            The following article will be continued (God-willing) next week. In this first article, we will deal with the subtle changes in the Gospel that make it more easy for many to compromise with Rome. Next week, we will deal with the subject of Biblical separation, and how the neglect of this practice opens one up to deception (as can be seen in our brother Jack Van Impe, who has in many ways compromised with Rome. We will quote Van Impe's earlier warnings from when he was a fiery fundamentalist, and show how he failed to follow his own advice. May the Lord restore him!) But let us get on with part one:

"Evangelical leaders James Dobson and Chuck Colson took part in a conference at the Vatican last month. They joined business executives, Catholic politicians, lawyers, and scholars Nov. 27-29 discussing family issues. Dobson, president of Focus on the Family and Colson, president of Prison Fellowship, also had a brief meeting with the pope, according to The Gazette of Colorado Springs. ...'Part of the thing is to get over the hump of knowing each other,' said Robert Sirico, a Catholic priest who is president of the Acton Institute, a conservative think-tank based in Grand Rapids, Mich...." (ReligionToday News, Dec.13, 2000)
One of the first sermons I ever preached contained scores of quotes from numerous, "out of print" Revelation commentaries predicting from the Scriptures that by the end of the 20th century many well-known Protestants and Evangelicals would compromise with the Roman Catholic Church. Since that sermon many well known evangelical leaders have indeed signed "ECT" (Evangelicals and Catholics Together). We have also seen a multitude of prophecy teachers begin to refer to the Pope as a "great evangelist." They do this even though the Pope has never preached the saving Gospel a day in his life! These men do not seem to care that their endorsements white-wash the false doctrines found in the Roman Catholic system that deceives many precious souls.

The Catholic Church sometimes professes to teach that people are saved by "grace." Yet, they quickly add that people are saved by grace THROUGH sacraments, baptism and works of charity, etc. They despise the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith ALONE. They were the original "Lordship salvationists," backloading and frontloading the Gospel with the help of "papa" Augustine. Men like Bill Bright, J.I. Packer, etc. naturally did not see much harm in embracing a polished brand of Catholicism (ECT), since their view of the Gospel is very similar. They all concluded that it is all a matter of semantics.

In light of this, it is obvious that the first thing a person needs to do to avoid ever compromising with Rome is to get a clear grasp of the difference between what people sometimes mock as "easy believism" (note: it wasn't easy for Jesus!) and so-called "Lordship salvation." A person does not have to endorse the confusion of praying for salvation, "asking Jesus into your heart," etc. to oppose a works Gospel. The ECT document states:

"We affirm together that we are Justified by grace through faith on account of Christ. Living faith is active in love that is nothing less than the love of Christ...."

It is important to notice two things about this statement. First, it does not say "faith alone." Second, there is a subtle, convenient redefinition of faith into something called "living faith." This enables the Catholics to hide baptism, sacraments and charity all under the word "faith"! This confuses the "faith made perfect" that a believer is supposed to exercise to be judged faithful before the future Judgment Seat of Christ, with the simple, naked faith a lost man is commanded to exercise in order to become a Christian to begin with. The faith a believer is to exercise (after he is already saved) is made perfect (or alive) by works. Therefore, it is NOT faith alone. A Christian is commanded to exercise faith AND works:

Hebrews 6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through FAITH AND PATIENCE inherit the promises.

James 2:6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy NAME by the which YE ARE CALLED?
17 Even so FAITH, if it hath not works, is dead, BEING ALONE.

These Jewish Christians have despised the poor. Therefore, James warns them about the future Judgment Seat (2:14, 3:1, 5:9). They will need to add works to their faith to be "justified" before the Judgment Seat of Christ. This has nothing to do with salvation in eternity. Salvation in eternity is by faith alone WITHOUT WORKS:

Romans 4:5 But to him that WORKETH NOT, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

The Evangelicals and the Catholics came together by molding "faith" into a toilet that would hold both doctrinal systems. Therefore, it is past time for fundamental Christians to stand against the temptation to change "faith" into a catch-all for works. Faith means faith. Belief means belief. A lost man is saved when he exercises simple faith in the Gospel. In this carnal age there is a great temptation to "guard" the Gospel and protect it from antinomianism by loading it with excess baggage. But the Gospel PAUL preached was subject to the false charge of antinomianism (Rom.3:8). If no one is slandering your preaching as antinomian, perhaps you should ask yourself why! If we will stand strong against Rome, we must stand for salvation by grace through faith ALONE, and we must LEAVE THE WORD FAITH ALONE!

God commands all of mankind (saved and unsaved) to repent. He demands relative righteousness of all mankind. Israel experienced the Roman destruction of A.D. 70 for not repenting. Herod was slain for sin. Ananias was slain for sin. Sodom perished for sin. America just might be next! (God have mercy on us). I preach "repent or die" to all men. I preach the hardest Judgment Seat of Christ than almost any modern Baptist that I know of. No carnal antinomianism here. I preach repent (turn from sin) or earn a hotter Hell! I preach turn or burn. However, I make sure I keep the Gospel of salvation in eternity pure. The one sin that will keep a person damned for all eternity, is the sin of rejecting Jesus Christ as Saviour and His finished work on the Cross, where He shed His BLOOD for the world. And therefore, the one thing a lost man must do to be saved, is obey Jesus Christ as Lord when He says:

"This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent." (John 6:29).

But does not this Gospel of so-called "easy believism" leave the man to indulge in stealing or cussing and still think he is "saved"? Sure, if old Christians sin, then certainly the newborns will sometimes need God to train them up and whip them into line. However, a faithful preacher will not let any Christian sinner feel safe. God killed many saints simply for treating the Lord's Supper as a regular meal (1Cor.11). Paul said that the Judgment Seat of Christ would be "terror" for some Christians (2Cor.5:9-11). Where then is there room for antinomianism? If a "grace" pastor has a church filled with people wearing immodest clothing, indulging in "moderate" drinking, living together before marriage, watching worldly movies, etc. The problem is not his pure, Rome defying Gospel. His problem is that he has not faithfully taught the commands and warnings of the NT, nor exercised church discipline.

CHRISTIANS COMPROMISING WITH ROME - AND HOW TO AVOID THE SIN (Pt.2)

CHRISTIANS COMPROMISING WITH ROME - AND HOW TO AVOID THE SIN (Pt.2)
"I have preached God's truth, so far as I know it, and I have not been ashamed of its peculiarities. That I might not stultify my testimony I have cut myself clear of those who err from the faith, and even from those who associate with them." (Spurgeon, 1888)

"Now concerning the matter of secondary separation, this is not even the issue. The issue is to be as safe as possible. If it is safe not to run with the wrong crowd, then it is safer not to run with the crowd who runs with the wrong crowd...Fundamentalists, let us be fundamentalists! We do not need liberal rouge or National Council of Churches eye shadow or ministerial association eye lashes or ecumenical toupees. Let us be what we are - old-fashioned, Hell-hating, sin-fighting, separated, soul-winning, Christ-honoring, window-rattling, barn-storming, God-fearing, Bible-loving, compassionate, weeping fundamentalists..." (Jack Hyles, "Biblical Separation," 1984)

"Old-fashioned fundamentalism seems to be disappearing. On every hand, Christian leaders are asking to be classified as evangelicals rather than as fundamentalists...The new designation of evangelical has a warm and more flexible sound. It is nonoffensive. It is much more flexible in its theology. It does not require separation from denominational organizations which no longer require belief in the famous five fundamentals. In fact, it offers some ground for fellowship with modern liberals." (John F. Walvoord; quoted in "Evangelicalism: the New Neutralism,"
Ashbrook)

"Evangelical leaders James Dobson and Chuck Colson took part in a conference at the Vatican last month. They joined business executives, Catholic politicians, lawyers, and scholars Nov. 27-29 discussing family issues. Dobson, president of Focus on the Family, and Colson, president of Prison Fellowship, also had a brief meeting with the pope, according to The Gazette of Colorado Springs..." (ReligionToday News, Dec.13, 2000)

Many modern Christian leaders who have compromised with Rome were once fundamentalists with strong convictions against evil associations. What happened to them? How did they change? I have had debates over the Internet with trained Catholic apologists who have tried, through great, emotional persuasion to get me to convert to Romanism. These "Jesuits" flatter and tell their victims how much they could use them on the other side. But who wants to kiss a Pope's foot? Not me. But I can only imagine the "pressure" that teachers with a greater audience must face. I am sure money is involved! [See the following sermon by Jack Van Impe to document this fact.] Is it a truth that the closer a Christian leader gets to making $200,000 a year, the "softer" he gets on the errors and falsehoods of Rome? Someone should research this and get back to me on it!

I believe that the Devil has deceived these good men who have compromised with Rome. Many of them began as "soul winners." They once preached on the importance of "catching the vision." But step by step, along the way, they began to make small compromises for the all-consuming passion to "win souls." Instead of being reproved for these compromises (e.g. associating with modernists without public rebuke) they often received pampering and justification from Christian leaders. No mature Christian leader wants to come across as jealous of another Christian's success. And who wants to be found resisting the work of God's Spirit? But let it be remembered, he who does not reprove when it is his responsibility to do so, is also resisting the work of God's Spirit!

After awhile, the small compromises of these Christian leaders began to grow into larger ones. Soon, they were praising the Pope, saying that his gospel is their gospel! Beware of the "little foxes." He that associates with TBN and the charismatics that associate with the Pope, without publicly reproving or rebuking them, will soon start praising the Pope himself!:

1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

1 Corinthians 5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a LITTLE leaven leaveneth the whole lump?

Proverbs 13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.

2 Timothy 2:22 Flee also youthful lusts: but FOLLOW righteousness, faith, charity, peace, WITH THEM that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

Romans 16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.

These are just a few Scriptures among many that teach us that we must beware of compromising associations. These associations have a great ability to change our thinking and habits:

Proverbs 22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: 25 LEST THOU LEARN HIS WAYS, and get a snare to thy soul.

I think it also follows that he who makes a friendship with a compromiser, will likewise "learn his ways."

It is true that some fundamentalists (especially novices with discourteous tongues, seeking to impress the old-timers) sometimes separate for the wrong reasons. Romans 14 teaches us that there are some false doctrines that we should not separate over. For example, the weak Christian who believes that it is wrong to eat meat because Adam only ate vegetables is certainly wrong. Jesus ate meat (Mark 14:14). However, Paul says that we should not break fellowship over such doctrines (Rom.14:1).

But can an obedient Christian teacher endorse major doctrinal corruption by association without rebuking the errors - and still be obedient? Of course not! Notice how Jesus handled one "association":

Luke 11:37 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to DINE WITH HIM: and he WENT IN, and sat down to meat.
38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.
39 And THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
40 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
42 But WOE UNTO YOU, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

And of course, Jesus was not even warmed up yet. As He buttered His bread, He continued His rebuke of the Pharisees and then tore into the lawyers. The point is that serious sin and false doctrine must be publicly, openly rebuked so one's ministry does not endorse sin or error, and that one protects himself from the subtle deception of gradual compromise.

We have seen so many influential fundamentalists end up endorsing Catholicism! If only they would have obeyed the warnings of the Bible and followed the example of Jesus! Men like Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell, Jack Van Impe and others, have heaped praise upon the Pope when they should be sounding the alarm against him!

In regard to Billy Graham, there was a time when all eyes were upon him. Christians had come face to face with the question of how far one should go to "evangelize" the lost. Should a preacher disassociate himself from those who denied the fundamentals of the faith, or should he instead use the association as an "opportunity" to evangelize? Those who supported Billy Graham in his early days stated:

"...this willingness to cooperate has never influenced him to adjust his preaching to suit any sponsoring groups...Recently Billy Graham has become a kind of test case...Very few evangelists have ever tried to do what Billy Graham is doing...the assertion that he will 'trim his message' [e.g. "The Sword of the Lord," Jan. 1958] displays the unfounded hope of some who are already prejudiced...It has been agreed by both his supporters and opponents that Billy Graham has never trimmed or diluted the message of the Bible." (Robert O. Ferm, "Cooperative Evangelism: Is Billy Graham Right or Wrong?," 1958)

Let it now be said, in hindsight, that the results of the "test" are in. Cooperation without open rebuke and reproof, before long, plunges one into great doctrinal deception. Billy Graham soon received in his "manners", the rotten fruit of his communications with compromisers. On Sept. 21, 1957, Graham stated in an interview with the San Francisco News:

"Anyone who makes a decision at our meetings is seen later and referred to a local clergyman, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish."

Graham later stated:

"I find that my beliefs are essentially the same as those of orthodox Roman Catholics." ("McCalls Magazine", Jan. 1978)

In 1979, Graham stated:

"I think the American people are looking for a leader, a moral and spiritual leader that believes something. And he... [Pope John Paul II] does....Thank God I've got somebody to quote now with some real authority." (Billy Graham on "The Phil Donahue Show")

Certainly, it is a blessing that many have found Christ through the ministries of those who have compromised with Catholics and Modernists. However, it must be remembered that the Bible does not command one or two men to evangelize the world. It commands every Christian to spread the Gospel. Therefore, although it might be argued that many souls have been saved through the ministries of compromisers, it could also certainly be argued that many souls have never had the opportunity to receive the Gospel because multitudes of Christians, following well-known, Christian leaders, decided it was not proper to witness to Catholics or liberals! To argue the positive influence of one compromiser is to therefore argue his negative influence on thousands of individual, would-be soul-winners who will probably never hand a Gospel tract to a Catholic.

Likewise, brother Jack Van Impe is now praising the Pope as a great "Billy Graham." To document how "evil communications corrupt good manners," notice the following words of Jack Van Impe as late as 1982:

"The following information is presented in the spirit of love...may all who read what I am about to share realize that I love them...Twenty years ago, I spent hours studying the book, 'The Two Babylons', by Alexander Hislop, published in 1858. Because of my Catholic upbringing, I was shocked. Still, I discovered that this startling material had never been proven wrong...Mystery Babylon is easily identified. She is a church whose main doctrine is lock, stock and barrel Babylonian...Romanism is Babylonianism in mystery form..." (Jack Van Impe, "Revelation Revealed")

However, in just a few years, Jack Van Impe would change his tune. He would first become convinced that fundamentalists are "too narrow" in their warnings. He would then become convinced that they are "mean". Ignoring all the warnings, he dived head-first into New Evangelicalism, and ended up EXACTLY where true fundamentalists predicted he would end up:

"...about 15, 16 years ago, the Holy Spirit broke my heart to show me how wrong this all was, that all Christians from all denominations, including our wonderful Catholic brothers and sisters are members of that one body...I remember our papers in my separatist movement, how they constantly attacked Billy Graham because of his love for Catholics...But that man changed me and I saw that love. And then I appreciated the Southern Baptist Convention, because Billy was one of the members of their group, and they never once objected to his proclaiming love for Catholics and all of God's children. Thank you, Billy and the Southern Baptist Convention....Oh, I have such respect for Pope John Paul II. I read every one of his sermons that bear witness with my spirit. I get stimulated, stirred, blessed, and he often uses John 14:6...[Rexella:] ...Well, from the magazine entitled 'The Challenge' which comes out of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, they reported on an article from 1938 which had a prophecy in it by the Blessed Fastina. And it goes like this: 'Out of Poland will come that spark that will prepare the world for the second coming of Christ.' [Jack:] That spark was Pope John Paul, and you know, he is the first Polish pope in history, and out of Poland he would arise to prepare the people for the second coming. That's why he believes in it with all of his heart." (Jack Van Impe Show, January 27, 1999)

If love is defined by whether or not one states that a person is lost, then neither the Father or the Son are very loving! God became a man, sending His Son to die so that a LOST world might be saved. True love would never withhold saving truth for money or any other motive. Those who leave churches who are loving the sheep enough to preach hard enough so they will be safe from sin, usually end up out of church totally, living like Atheists. In the same manner, those who stop reproving serious error and doctrinal compromise, for the sake of fellowship (or even for the sake of soul-winning), usually end up praising the Pope!

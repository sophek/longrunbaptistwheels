Money: The Worldly Woman's God; The Holy Woman's Servant

One thing the world continually throws before us every chance it gets is a spirit of discontentment with such things as we have. Everywhere we turn we will hear in some way the propaganda that "things" bring happiness. "You must dress this way, own this car, this house, this pool, these jewels, have this computer equipment, etc. and you will be happy and envied." Christians should know better than to seek these things, but many are deceived by riches and loose their joy in Jesus because of it.

Unfortunately, there are those that worship riches as an end. They see money as the way to quickly gratify themselves. Purchasing makes them happy, and the only way to continue purchasing is to have a lot of money, or to live above their means and get into debt. Therefore, many husbands and wives reject the Bible command for a woman to be a keeper at home in order to have a larger income so they can have a greater "purchasing power."

Many Christian families though, have left great income levels in order to have the wife stay home. Women all over are making the sacrifice of giving up "things" in order to follow the Lord, and care for their homes and families. They have decided that a holy family is worth much more than money could buy for them. They would rather rear an honest child who is morally strong and devoted to Jesus than to have a fashionable child clothed in all of the most current styles and name brands. Ladies, you cannot serve both God and money! It is impossible to instill into your families godly virtues that you hold dear when you are only with them for about four waking hours during the day! How much time do you spend with them out of those four hours, when you are not busy cleaning or cooking, watching television or reading, or when they are not busy with other things? Your children being with you is much more important than giving them plenty of "stuff." Christians wonder why they are losing their kids to the world.

The whole modern society is crazed with a sense of "freedom" which is really nothing less than bondage. They want free lives. I remember when I was living this type of lifestyle, working and without children. Women with children would look at me with an envy and longing after what I had. They would resent my freedom to "get up and go"; go on an impulse journey with my husband, sleep in until noon on a Saturday, and do nothing else all day long but what ever I felt like doing, going to expensive stores and coffee shops. I do not look after these women I meet in this lifestyle with envy. It is worthless and ends up with nothing in the end. Is it labor to give my all to my family? Yes! But the paybacks are innumerable. The emotional, as well as the spiritual rewards are endless. I am not sorry I left the work place! I am so much more available for my family and friends, my church and ministries than I ever was before! Living for yourself in no way compares with living for the Lord and others. Though a sense of "freedom" might reign with the person following after riches, a sense of divine purpose is denied.

There are countless numbers of rich people who would have given every last cent for one day of health. Some would have given every possession so that their spouse or child would be well. Money is a terrible comforter to its worshipers. Even a beautiful satin lined, gold trimmed casket cannot be taken with a person to judgement. The only thing that makes sense is following the True God. He alone, whether He leads you in poverty or riches, can make your life profitable and meaningful. Letting every action be guided by the Lord's direction leads to a life of blessing and excitement, though not often riches or wealth.

Proverbs 13:7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

Spinach and Ricotta

This is a fun and tasty way to eat spinach! It is a quiche style dish that you cook in a pie crust.

-1 cup cooked and drained spinach (if you buy the frozen spinach you don't have to cook it. Only thaw.)

-1 cup ricotta cheese, I use whole milk ricotta, but you can also use skim

-3 eggs lightly beaten

-1 teaspoon salt

Â½ teaspoon pepper

1/4 teaspoon allspice

-Mix all ingredients and pour into pie shell, or several tart size shells. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes.

Excerpt from "Not Regina"
++++++++++++++++++++

"Not Regina", from C. Carol Kauffman, is a wonderful story about the Baptist persecutions during the 1500's.

"The Bible also teaches true discipleship which means that our entire way of life must be patterned after Christ. That means we can't hide our identity, for everything we say and think and do will be an outward expression of our inner experience with Christ. 'Whosoever will come after me,' Jesus said, 'let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.' It's not attending church every Sunday. It's far more than that. It's living with Christ and for Christ every moment of every day. We are no longer our own, but Christ's, for He has purchased us with His own precious blood, and put His Spirit within us to guide us and make us want to follow Him."

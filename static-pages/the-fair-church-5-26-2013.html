Song of Solomon Series



TEXT: Song of Solomon 4:1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast 



doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.



Esther 1:11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the 



princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.



12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was 



the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.



Psalms 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of 



holiness.



Psalms 96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.



1 Peter 3:4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament 



of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.



5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, 



being in subjection unto their own husbands:



Ephesians 5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own 



husbands in every thing.



Ezekiel 7:20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their 



abominations and of their detestable things therein...



Ezekiel 16:25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be 



abhorred...and multiplied thy whoredoms.



1 Thessalonians 4:7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.



Romans 12:9...Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.



Isaiah 52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that 



publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation...



Song of Solomon 4:7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.



2 Peter 3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of 



him in peace, without spot, and blameless.



1 Timothy 6:14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of 



our Lord Jesus Christ:



Ephesians 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,



27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; 



but that it should be holy and without blemish.



28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies...



Psalms 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy 



word.



Jude 1:23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by 



the flesh.



2 Corinthians 7:1  Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all 



filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.



James 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify 



your hearts, ye double minded.



Jude 1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without 



fear:



1 Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven...



11...if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a 



drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.



13...Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.



4:1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks:



Song of Solomon 6:9 My dove, my undefiled...



Psalms 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall 



not cleave to me.



Psalms 120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.



"My kindest words appear to provoke them, and they are at daggers drawn at once. Nothing pleases 



them...both David and David's Lord endured the same trial. It is the lot of the saints to find foes even in 



their own households. Others besides David dwelt in the place of dragons. Others besides Daniel have 



been cast into a den of lionsâ€¦" (Spurgeon)



...thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.



1 Corinthians 11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a 



covering.



Jeremiah 7:29 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high 



places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.



Song of Solomon 6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock 



of goats that appear from Gilead.

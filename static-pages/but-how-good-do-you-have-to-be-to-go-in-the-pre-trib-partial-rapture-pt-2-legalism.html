            BUT HOW GOOD DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO GO IN THE PRE-TRIB PARTIAL RAPTURE? (PT.2: LEGALISM)
"But How Good Do You Have To Be To Go In The Pre-Trib Partial Rapture?" (Pt. 2: Legalism)

"The partial rapture theory conditions the privilege of rapture upon human works, and as such is a co-mingling of legalism with grace... Grace, not fear of the Tribulation, is the motive and the power for right conduct... But if translation depends upon spiritual maturity, on readiness, or upon "watching," it then becomes necessary to ask: Just how ready must the believer be? What degree of spiritual maturity will God require? What degree of perfection must the believer attain before he is assured a place in the rapture?"
Gerald B. Stanton,

The preceding quote shows the extent in which the will of mature Christians can hold forth a wrong conclusion with nothing but false intellectual grounds as props.

One may kick down the props, yet nothing happens. Their conclusion still holds. Why? Usually it is because it is not a conclusion based upon logic, reason, or the Word of God. It is one based upon emotion and prejudice. Nevertheless, may God's Spirit blow where it listeth, even upon His saints. Let the flimsy objections disguised as the mighty pillars of enlightened reason be revealed as cardboard props. If yet indeed the vain conclusions still hold strong, then let them stand as witnesses to the truth of Descartes keen observation:

"That the will as well as the understanding is required for judging."
( Mtt.13:15, Jms.2:20, Hos.4:6)

What is the reason why such objections as these to the partial rapture prove to be false? Would not the fear of missing the pre-trib rapture actually be legalism instead of grace? (It does not appear to these objectors that looking at their own deeds for assurance of salvation in eternity proves to be worse legalism using the same argument!) Many times such scary words as "legalism" are recklessly thrown around. It is known that one cannot find the word "legalism" in Scripture. Yet where is the concept of legalism found? And what exactly is it about the partial rapture doctrine that supposedly makes it "legalism"?

Usually when one hears the term "legalism", someone is being rebuked for teaching extra commandments of men, in place of God's New Testament commandments. This is how the concept is seen in Scripture. Someone was placing extra Old Testament commandments upon New Testament believers. (Mtt.15:3, Acts 15:1, Gal.5:2, Col.2:20-22) There is absolutely nothing in the partial rapture teaching that is placing any extra Old Testament or made up commandments of men upon Christians. The partial rapture teaching says that if one does not obey what God tells the New Testament Christian to obey, such a one is in danger of missing the reward of the firstfruit rapture. The commandments to be obeyed for such a reward are clearly defined in the New Testament. And under the teaching, whether or not these commands are obeyed has nothing to do with the believers salvation in eternity.

Therefore, what the introductory quote apparently means by "legalism" is the teaching that the believer should obey God to attain temporal blessings, while fearing the loss of such blessings. Yet, where in Scripture can one find such a concept seen as error? In fact in every Epistle where "legalism" is condemned, this very teaching is found right along with it! Imagine one using Galatians to define the error of "legalism", when what one means by "legalism" is taught in the very same Epistle! Fear and hope are taught throughout Galatians:


Galatians 5:

14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
Galatians 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.


Galatians 6:

7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
The above verses are commands. (v.9) These show consequences that result from certain actions. The believer is reminded in Galatians to fear the consequences of disobedience and to seek the reward of doing well. Therefore to call the partial rapture teaching "legalism" based upon the Epistle to the Galatians appears nothing less than contrived.

Now at once such will prove even more nonsensical when one realizes that all those who reject the partial rapture teaching believe a believer should strive to attain crowns. They all believe that a believer should fear missing these crowns, arriving at the judgment seat of Christ in shame. (1Jn.2:28) This is a very interesting phenomenon because this does not qualify as "legalism" under their theology even though it involves obedience, fear and hope! Furthermore all of these anti-partial rapturists even believe that if a believer sins, God can make him sick in this life or worse yet, kill him! (1Cor.11:30,31) Yet such a fear is not seen as "legalism". No, only the teaching that a believer may reap to himself the loss of the reward of the firstfruit, pretrib translation is seen as "legalism". Therefore the objection is a straw man and a broken reed! It is the pot calling the kettle black! Why not write books about how the teaching of missing crowns is "legalism"? Could it be that losing a jeweled crown in a golden city of jewels does not appear to be a very threatening consequence? Is not this the reason? Is it not simply that the partial rapture teaching causes one to really fear God, thereby becoming the means of sanctifying grace? (Heb.11:5,7, 12:15,28)

If asked where the line of holiness lies in attaining to the pre-trib rapture, let one simply ask where the degree of holiness lies in attaining crowns and escaping shame.(1Jn.2:28) Should not all strive by the gracious power of God in obedience to attain a full reward? (2John 1:8, Heb.13:20,21, Phil.2:12)

Christ said that the believer is to pray to not be lead into temptation. (Mtt.6:13, Lk.21:36) Such is a godly desire, hope and prayer. The coming tribulation period is a great time of temptation and trial. (Rev.3:10) All should pray to escape it as Christians. None should be found presuming upon God by calling such a hope "legalism". Passive, Gnostic, mysticism has disguised itself as real sanctifying grace for too long!

        <h1> 34 SCRIPTURE PROMISES FROM HERB EVANS ANSWSERED</h1>
        <div id="content">
            These 34 promises (by Herb Evans) are supposed to negate the truth taught in my book "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" This is the answer to his objections.

[10-17-01]

"1. . . . he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. -- Heb. 13:5, Joey must say that Christ will leave and forsake carnal Christians."

This is a NT quote from the OT where God gave this promise and then KILLED a bunch of them for presuming upon Him (Deut.31;6, 8, 29, etc., with Jer.23:9, Lam.5:20-22). And this promise in HEBREWS comes right after the warnings to believers in Hebrews 6, Hebrews 10, and Hebrews 12!:

Hebrews 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
29 For our God IS A CONSUMING FIRE.

Therefore, the GOD that never "leaves thee" is a God who is a CONSUMING FIRE! Therefore, He that never leaves is able to COMFORT or TERRORIZE depending upon how the believer responds. No, He never leaves:

Psalms 139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.

If He casts off and appears to forsake HIS PEOPLE in His wrath, IT WILL NOT BE ETERNAL:

Lamentations 3:31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:

"2. I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. -- Eccl. 3:14, Joey must say that some things that God does are not forever, specifically God saving a man. And he must also say that something can be taken from it, if that Christian must wind up in hell."

This would only be true if Christ had ever promised that believers whom He will raise up on the Last Day could never be punished at His coming during the Millennium. Yet, he warned His disciples many times that they COULD be so punished even though they are saved and will never perish on the Last Day in eternity. Now notice, Herb wants to use this against temporary Christian punishment during the Millennium. But by the same logic we could say that UNBELIEVERS whom God presently allows to ENJOY sunshine, rain (Mt.5:45), children, laughter, riches, food, and PROSPERITY (see Ps.73), must continue to do so FOREVER! But no one but a Universalist believes this.

When God grants salvation to believers it is FOREVER. They can never lose it. Yet, this does not mean that as SONS they cannot be SCOURGED.

"3. . . . the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.-- Psa. 37:28, Joey must say that the LORD does forsake some saints and that some of them are not preserved forever."

What does Ezek.18:24 state? Furthermore, notice:

Luke 21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
18 But there shall NOT A HAIR OF YOUR HEAD PERISH.

Now how does Mr. Evans interpret the "perish" in Luke 21:18? Does he hold it as meaning "ULTIMATELY perish," or does he hold it to mean "absolutely"? If it is absolute then what meaneth verse 16? Some Christians were burned at the stake. Their HAIRS PERISHED. But they WILL BE resurrected with every hair. Therefore, we learn that such promises can be temporarily, apparently interrupted, but never entirely overthrown! If believers can perish now for sin in the day of God's longsuffering (1 Cor.11), they can temporarily PERISH for sin in the day of God's JUDGMENT. Yet, they will never perish for good. They will be resurrected and all tears will be wiped away.

"4. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. -- Psa. 89:29, Joey must say that some of His seed will not endure forever."

Mr. Evans  didn't read the REST of the passage:

Psalms 89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
32 Then will I visit their transgression WITH THE ROD, and their iniquity WITH STRIPES.
33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

Jesus applies such stripes to carnal believers at His Second Coming (Luke 12). Yet, in the end, all such Christians will be with Jesus in eternal bliss.

"5. . . . him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -- John 6:37, Joey must say that some believers may be cast out that come to Him."

And in the next two verses He shows the CONTEXT:

John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the LAST DAY.

We are dealing with the last day, which begins at the GWT (see John 12). Through faith alone, believers are assured of a resurrection into eternal bliss on the last day. Through faith AND works, they get this, PLUS the Millennial glory.

"6. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Rom. 8:38,39, Joey must disagree with Paul and believe that something can and might separate Joey from the love of God."

Here is where I prove my claim that Mr. Evans is defending a psychobabble view of the Judgment Seat of Christ. His view of love does not allow SCOURGING (punish SEVERELY). But God says He SCOURGETH His sons (Heb.12). God loves His saints. That is why He punishes them when they are disobedient. He made some sick in 1 Cor.11 and killed others (1 Cor.11). If this is not against His LOVE in the day of His PATIENCE, it certainly will not be against His love to say He will slay some believers in the day of His JUDGMENT! The fact that God loves His saints INSURES that they will not get away with PRESUMING upon His mercy and warnings!

"7. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- Heb. 7:25, Joey must say that all saints are not saved to the uttermost that come to God by Christ. And that He does not intercede for the carnal saints at some time or other."

Mr. Evans seems to think Christ's present intercession KEEPS Christians saved. This means that he has confused a ONCE FOR ALL sacrifice, already finished, with a present ministry of "bringing many SONS to glory" (Heb.2:10). Christ's present intercession for believers is to empower them and grant them mercy and cleansing in their daily WALK. It is not Christ, but many believers that forsake this intercession. They will not come to the throne of grace and confess, and therefore, He doesn't wash. This has to do with whether or not they will win the Millennium and avoid scourging at the Judgment Seat (Heb.10) by getting mercy for WILFUL SIN committed AS A CHRISTIAN.

"8. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, -- 1 Th. 5:9, Joey must say that some saints, prior to the future wraths, are appointed to wrath."

God has also appointed it unto men ONCE to die (Heb.9:27). Yet, Enoch did not die, and Tabitha died TWICE. It is God's PROVISION that ALL His saints be crowned and win the Millennial Reign. Yet, some will ignore this provision and plan. They will have only themselves to blame, not God. He wanted them to get power and mercy BEFORE the coming day of the JSOC. Furthermore, if this WRATH is defined as the wrath the LOST receive on the last day at the GWT, then a believer experiencing God's wrath at the Judgment Seat and during the Millennium, will no more negate this promise than when the Corinthians received it in this life for treating the Lord's Supper as an ordinary meal.

Paul warns that Christians can experience God's wrath:

Ephesians 5:6 Let no man DECEIVE YOU with vain words: for because of these things cometh the WRATH of God upon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not YE therefore PARTAKERS WITH THEM.

"9. Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ (Judgement Seat): -- Phil. 1:6, Joey must say that the judgement seat ends the good work that was begun in the Christian at the new birth."

Yet, this WORK is dependent upon our will (from our side). Paul explains this in Phil.2:12,13. Christians cannot just "let go and let God." God SLEW some believers in 1 Cor.11. They died in SIN. Many believers die in sin. Herb believes that some believers can arrive at the Judgment Seat and lose crowns for unfaithfulness. Did Jesus not PEFORM His good work? Obviously, the promise is for us to know that God's grace is available if we will APPLY it:

Hebrews 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, LET US HAVE GRACE, WHEREBY WE MAY SERVE GOD acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
29 For our God is a consuming fire.

If we will not APPLY it, He will not PERFORM it:

Hebrews 12:15 Looking diligently lest any man FAIL OF THE GRACE OF GOD; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;

This is not the grace of eternal salvation. It is the grace that brings power in our sanctification. If we ignore God's gracious supply of the Spirit (and walk by the flesh), we will reap destruction and judgment.

"10. And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.-- 2 Tim. 4:18, Joey must say that everyone is not delivered from the consequences of every evil work and will not all be preserved unto His heavenly kingdom."

The context is the wrath of mankind in its persecution of Christians. It is GOD'S Providence and Resurrecting power contrasted with MAN'S (and the Devil's) intentions. God will preserve unto His kingdom. Yet, at the door of this Kingdom, those Christians that are found unworthy will be cast out during the Millennium. God's preserving (if it is to be here interpreted as preserving "in holiness"), is again, qualified upon our RESPONSES. Compare:

1 Thessalonians 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be PRESERVED BLAMELESS unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Colossians 1:22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and UNBLAMEABLE and unreproveable in his sight:
23 IF YE CONTINUE in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard...

"11. And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither
shall any man pluck them out of my hand. -- John 10:28, Joey must say that God takes away a Christians eternal life for a while, and he must also say that not of every Christian can it be said that they shall NEVER perish nor can never be plucked out of his hand."

Jesus also says that not a hair will perish, yet in the same context He says they will be put to death! If temporary death IN THIS LIFE does not negate this Scripture, then neither will temporary death AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT. The Scripture (unless Herb will teach that no believer will ever die physically in this life - called "perishing" in many Scriptures) simply states that a believer's final, eternal state is SECURE in Jesus. Yet, God will judge His people.

"12. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth
on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condem-
nation; but is passed from death unto life. -- John 5:24, He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- John 3:18, Joey must contradict the Saviour by saying that not all believers shall not come into condemnation. And not all believers have passed from death to life permanently, but may pass from life to death at the JOC and life again."

Again, the CONDEMNATION in CONTEXT is ETERNITY (see John 3:16). The context is not the age that occurs before the eternal age. Temporary condemnation at the Judgment Seat (and during the Millennium) no more negates these Scriptures than temporary condemnation of believers IN THIS LIFE negates them:

James 5:9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be CONDEMNED: behold, the judge standeth before the door. [Context is the coming of Christ]

1 Corinthians 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto CONDFEMNATION. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

"13. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. -- 1 John 1:7-10, Joey must say that the blood of Jesus Christ does not cleanse ALL sins of ALL Christians. He must also either all Christians die with some sin or that there are some Christians that have no sin. If Joey says that you must confess all sin to avoid hell, like a Catholic that just came out of the confessional booth, that at that point only are you free from sin and a candidate for the rapture and kingdom and may avoid the Christian hell."

Mr. Evans (and most modern Baptists) believe that there IS some loss at the JSOC. If there is some loss (of crowns, etc.), then we ask Herb: If the Blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin, then why will some believers lose crowns and appear in shame, etc.? Does Herb teach believers must confess ALL sins to avoid losing crowns? Whatever standard Herb uses is the same standard we use for escaping punishment at the JSOC and avoiding the underworld during the Millennium. This Scripture is addressed to Christians. If we do not confess, He does not forgive (unless God decides to be merciful unconditionally). Therefore, we are not to TEMPT God or presume upon Him. We are never to gamble. We are to confess and forsake all the sins we can, and then obey the conditions for getting mercy at the Judgment Seat (i.e. forgive others, FEAR GOD'S WARNINGS, confess, forsake). If we think we stand, take heed!

"14. My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:, -- 1 John 2:1, Joey must either say only some have an advocate with the Father, if they can wind up in hell or that only those that confess their sin have an advocate with the Father."

Herb's argument would negate losing crowns at the JSOC just as much as it would negate being literally punished there, missing the Millennium, and going to temporary outer darkness. In fact, it would negate ANY punishment for sin, even in THIS LIFE. Herb has successfully argued himself into becoming the ultimate antinomian! He argues so far, he leaves no room for chastisement in this life or any loss at the JSOC. But if he attempts to explain how these Scriptures allow room for temporary chastisement in this life, as well as loss at the Judgment Seat, he by necessity must move over and allow literal punishment at the JSOC and during the Millennium. Temporary punishment is temporary punishment, whether it is administered in this age of patience, or in the next age of Judgment.

"15. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. -- 2 John 1:9, Joey must say that not abiding in Christ removes a Christian from sonship and having life in the Son."

Being a son is not the same as being a FIRSTBORN son with a double portion. Nor does being a son keep one from getting a good SCOURGING for disobedience.

"16. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.,-- Eph. 1:13,14, Joey must say that the sealing of the Holy Spirit is not a finalized thing, if the sealed one winds up in hell. He must also say that for some this Holy Spirit is not an earnest or pledge of his inheritance and purchased possession."

Herb pretends that it is somehow obvious that a believer sealed by the Spirit cannot be temporarily banished to the underworld. If they can be made sick, and slain in the day of God's patience, they can be slain in the day of God's judgment. Some believers will appear at the JSOC in shame (1 Jn.2:28), losing crowns. If this is possible in Herb's scheme, and it does not negate this Scripture, then neither does going to the underworld. All believers will be in bliss in eternity. Some will have to pay their dues for abusing the TEMPLE of the Holy Ghost:

1 Corinthians 3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

"17. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. -- John 14:17, Joey must say that the Holy Spirit must be taken out of the believer, if the believer is sent to hell or the Holy Spirit must go to hell with the carnal believer."

Psalms 139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.

If Jesus, by the Spirit, went to Hell to preach, then why can't the Spirit be there in the underworld with banished believers? If a Christian can die upon a stake with the indwelling Spirit, why can't he die at the Judgment Seat by God's fire? If a Christian can fornicate and still be indwelt by the Spirit, why can't he be punished for this fornication and still be indwelt by the indwelling Spirit? Does fire hurt God?

"18. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. -- Heb. 10:39, Joey must say that there are some, who do draw back into perdition and that he does not believe in the saving of the soul for all Christians."

Paul is simply saying he is confident that the Hebrew saints will continue and get Millennial glory. This salvation of the soul is at the JSOC (Heb.9:28). Perdition here is Millennial judgment. And we are happy to hear Herb's confession of who the "we" in Hebrews refers to. Surely Herb is not now going to say that the "we" a few verses earlier in 10:26 does not refer to Paul and true believers? If the "we" here is NOT professors, then neither is the "we" in 10:26, 30.

"19. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. -- 1 John 5:12, Joey must say that the believer has life, and then at the JOC does not have life and then has life again After his Lake of Fire incarceration. During this time, the believer does not have life, Joey must say that he does not have the Son. Also, he must also say that in between confessions and repentance the believer yo yo's between life and no life and having the son and not having the son."

By the same logic, Herb must say that a Christian who dies (1 Cor 11), had life, but then doesn't have it anymore, and then will have it again at Christ's coming. If temporary physical death does not negate this verse now, it will not negate it at the Judgment Seat. All believers possess "life" in eternity, and continue to possess it, even if they go to the underworld. They are guaranteed that they will be raised when the eternal age begins.

"20. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- 1 John 3:2, Joey must say that, when Christ appears at the rapture, only some will be like him."

Yet, John JUST got through saying that some will stand in shame at His appearing (1 Jn.2:28). Does Jesus stand in shame? The Bible says He will stand in Millennial glory. All Baptists admit that 1 Jn.2:28 applies to slothful believers. Therefore, being "like him" either does not mean "like Him in glory", or it is a statement that must be qualified. If one will not accept that some positive promises must be qualified, then one must take many promises of prayer at full force and believe that whatever we ask we will certainly receive! Many of Christ's promises concerning prayer do not contain ANY conditions (Mt.21:22, John 14;13, 14, Mark 11:23, 24, Matthew 18:19, Matthew 7: 7,8). Yet, conditions are added in other texts (John 15:7, James 4:3, 1 John 3;22, 5:14, 15). Therefore, John is saying that these believers will appear in glory, like Christ, IF they obey his PREVIOUS admonition to ABIDE in Christ. If they don't, they will appear in shame, and will be punished (as taught in John 15, 2 Cor.5, Mark 9, etc.).

In the OT, Israel was given many positive promises that contained no apparent conditions in the verses (Ex.6:6-8, 12:25, Num.13:2, 14:23, etc.). Yet, only TWO who were given these promises made it over with the little ones. Paul says NT believers would do well to remember this (1 Cor.10:11, Heb.3:19, 4:1, 11).

"21. It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus (Judgement Seat). -- 1 Cor. 5:1,5, Joey must say that both this fornicator's body and spirit will die at the judgement seat and that his spirit would not be saved then."

There is a MAY in the verse. If the fornicator responds to his chastisement, and repents, he will receive mercy and can get back in the race (as long as he is not hardened or DEAD). Most believe that the man does repent and Paul refers to him in 2 Corinthians.

"22. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. -- 1 Cor. 3:15, Joey must say that the man is to be burned at the judgement seat rather than his works. He must also say that it is His new body that is burned as well as his new man and nature that is burned in the Lake of Fire."

Yet the very next verse says the MAN can be DESTROYED for defiling the Temple. The "yet so as by fire" applies to the MAN, not his works. It is the man that is saved in the end, and it is the man that is saved in the end "so as by fire." This is the interpretation of the figure. As with Christ's parables, the judgment is literal. If a man's works all burn up, he is STILL saved. Yet, only after he suffers loss by fire. Notice, this whole passage blows the Hyper-Calvinist system out the water. If Herb will teach that there are no carnal Christians that can be punished at the JSOC, and that all the warnings apply to professors, he is refuted by this passage. All the man's works burn in the ILLUSTRATION. Yet, he is in the end, saved. I teach that the end here is AFTER the Millennium.

"24. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: -- Col. 1:13, Joey must say that some believers are not completely delivered and that they must be removed from the kingdom of His dear Son after being translated into it."

Unless Herb is already making his way toward Amillennialism (like T.T, Shields when he went up against Panton), any present, spiritual Kingdom is NOT the same as the MILLENNIAL Kingdom. Govett taught that all Christians are in Christ's spiritual Kingdom, (in this age of grace), but all will not be in the Kingdom of manifestation. G.N.H. Peters, who wrote the "Theocratic Kingdom" (also a selective rapturist by the way, since you use it as a dirty word) believed these verses that speak of a present Kingdom are only potentially and provisionally true. He held they apply to the Millennium but that they are calling the future as if it was the present, much like Romans 8:30, etc. Either way, a present, spiritual Kingdom is not the same as the Millennial Kingdom. One is free; the other is through faith and works. And if Peters is correct, we have seen that God's promises often contain implied conditions.

"25. To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. -- Gal. 4:5,6, Joey must either put his children in the Lake of fire or his children must cease to be his children or sons."

God makes some Christians sick, and kills others for sin in this life (1 Cor.11). Therefore, since no earthly, loving parent does this, we are discussing apples and oranges. If God deals with His children in such a manner in this age of patience, He will certainly do so in the day of His Judgment.

"26. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; -- Titus 3:5, Joey must say that salvation is not completely of grace but that a Christian must work to keep from carnality or confess his carnality before death to work his way out of hell or to keep from hell."

Herb still appears unable to distinguish the MILLENNIUM from ETERNITY. Salvation in eternity is all of grace through faith alone. The age to come, the Millennium, is through works:

Hebrews 6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith AND PATIENCE inherit the promises.

Hebrews 4:11 Let us LABOUR therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

Matthew 16:27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to HIS WORKS.

"27. And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: -- Phil. 3:9, For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. -- 2 Cor. 5:21, Joey must say that you must have Christ's righteousness plus some of your own to stay out of hell and that we are not completely the righteousness of God in Him."

Herb also now has forgotten basic Sunday School lessons about the difference between practical righteousness and positional righteousness. We get punished in this life, or at the Judgment Seat for the former, not the latter. Christ's righteousness TO us saves us in ETERNITY, Christ's righteousness IN us, saves us at the Judgment Seat. If believers (who are absolutely perfect in God's sight in one sense) can be slain now, they can be temporary slain at the JSOC and during the Millennium.

"28. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. -- 1 John 3:9, Joey must say that some believer's seed does not remain in them and that some believers are viewed by God as not sinning, who cannot sin and therefore cannot be punished in hell or that a Christian must go through his life without the flesh not committing any sin. And not being able to sin."

This new form of antinomian Gnosticism is the very thing John is writing against. John uses the phrase "born of God" like Paul uses the phrase "walk in the Spirit." John uses it in his epistles to refer to a believer's WALK in fellowship with God. How does a believer know he is walking with God (i.e. born of God)? The same way he knows whether or not he is walking in the Spirit. If we walk in sin, we are not walking in Him. We are not abiding in Him. The Gnostics said that only the "spiritual" mattered, and that they could walk in the physical flesh as they pleased. John says that any believer who embraces this lie will appear in shame at His Coming. Yet, I don't have the time or space to develop this interpretation here. I therefore simply say, again, that if believers can be slain now, they can be slain at the JSOC and during the Millennium.

"29. I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father., -- 1 John 2:13, Joey must say that these young men have not YET overcome the wicked one and may still wind up in hell."

Herb does not distinguish between overcoming by faith through getting saved, and overcoming in the CHRISTIAN WALK. Unless one is an Augustinian Caltholic, they are NOT THE SAME. Christians can also be said to HAVE overcome in certain areas of their maturity; yet this does not mean they have no battles that still lie ahead. Pauls shows in Hebrews 5 and 1 Cor.3 that Christian growth can be hindered.

"30. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? -- 1 John 5:4,5, Joey must say that merely our faith and being born again does not overcome the world."

No, believers must also WALK, RUN and FIGHT by faith. They must RESIST the Devil. They must separate (2 Cor.6), and LOVE NOT the world. John writes to believers who already believe, so they can believe on Christ for a DAILY supply of overcoming power:

1 John 5:13 These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that YE MAY BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God.

Therefore, we must believe for daily living in a present, ascended Christ who is the Son of God. When we fail to believe these things, we will be overcome by the world and the Devil in our battles. We will appear in shame and be banished during the Millennium.

"31. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. -- Rev. 12:11, Joey must say that the testimony of overcoming by the blood of the Lamb is not enough to keep a believer from hell."

Oh no. It is enough. However, all believers do not lay down their lives for Jesus. The Blood of the Lamb also sanctifies if it is trusted in (Heb.13). All believers do not claim its power and fight.

"32. . . . all which he hath given to me I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING, but should raise it up again at the last day. -- John 6:39, Joey must say that Christ loses some, if but for but a little while."

The context is the last day. John 12 shows this is at the GWT. Punishment at the JSOC no more negates this than sickness or death in this life for sin.

"33. . . . everyone that seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life; and I shall raise him up at the last day. -- John 6:40, Joey must find something to discredit carnal believers from being, as promised, raised up at the last day."

This is discussing only what one gets by believing. It is eternal life on the last day (GWT). Yet, through faith and works, believers get the PRIZE and avoid chastisement during the Kingdom of God.

"34. . . . all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation. -- John 5:28,29, Joey must create another resurrection category for those, who have done good and then done bad, or he must put Christians in with those, who have done evil and are damned."

"Damned" simply means judged or condemned. It is often used for Christians (1 Cor.11:29, 1 Tim.5:12, Romans 14:23). Does Herb hold that unbelievers get resurrected BEFORE the Millennial Kingdom? Herb deleted part of the verse:

John 5:28 Marvel not at this: for THE HOUR is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

Thus, these are the resurrections of good and bad at a certain HOUR (not divided by a Millennium). Furthermore, the context is not FAITH but LIFESTYLE. I hold Christians are found in these resurrections. One attains unto the First Resurrection (Phil.3:11); the other group loses it.

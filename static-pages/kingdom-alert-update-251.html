FROM THE EDITOR
********************

During the past few weeks, I was blessed to preach in Crown of Life
Baptist Church (brother Dzula), and at Calvary Bible Church (pastor Jim
Brooks, in Chattanooga, at the 2nd Edwin Wilson accountability/kingdom
conference), and at Faith Baptist Church (pastor Tracy Daniels,
Chattanooga). These brethren are strong advocates of Millennial exclusion
and accountability teaching. I praise the Lord for their stand, and for
their fellowship.

TOLERATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY LINKED TO TV
******************************************************

In the May 24, 2004 issue of "Newsweek," there was an article entitled,
"The Will & Grace Effect." It states, "Research found that seeing likeable
gay characters on shows like 'Will & Grace' caused anti-gay prejudice to
drop....it was a shock when their 18-year old daughter, Diana, recently
announced her support for gay marriage. Diana says her views solidified
after she saw a just-married gay couple on TV. 'I just thought how sweet
it was...'....If you don't personally know someone who is gay, you'll find
plenty of gay characters and culture on TV....In one study, students with
few or no gay acquaintances were shown 10 episodes of HBO's 'Six Feet
Under.' Afterward, their levels of anti-gay prejudice dropped by 12
percent."

Conclusion: Pastors, fathers - please, for the sake of the flock, for the
sake of America, gather the church together and smash your television set
as an example to the "little ones":

Galatians 5:13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use
not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

1 Corinthians 8:9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours
become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

BIG LEAGUE DREAMS AND BEER
************************************
Our local city (Mansfield, TX) recently voted to allow a California
company to come in and build a multi-million dollar complex. The catch is
that it must be a "public/private" park (whatever that means). It must be
"private," so they can sell beer (Mansfield is a dry city). And it must be
public, so they can use eminent domain, etc. They were going to take a
lady's property (Wanda Allen, a widow). But with some protest over the
park, the city decided to build it elsewhere. Yet, there is still the
issue of the beer sales during little league games. This company also
hosts "gay days." Pray they will decide to leave behind the alcohol out of
this park.

Luke 17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these
little ones.

THE NEW, LAODICEAN BIBLE INTERPRETATION: "UNTO THE DRUIDS I BECAME A
DRUID!"
***********************************************************************

1 Corinthians 9:21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being
not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain
them that are without law.
22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all
things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

The perversion of Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 9:21-22 continues in its
madness. First, multitudes of professing Christians began racing to
ungodly movies and bars (to shine their "holy light" in such dark places).
Then, some Christians decided to have "Bible study" in Hooters (under the
banner of 1 Corinthians 9, of course). And on the heels of this
lasciviousness, multitudes of churches have apparently said, "Why meet in
Hooters? Let's just turn OUR CHURCH into a Hooters!" (I have never been to
Hooters, but I know it is a restaurant/bar with immodest waitresses). I
think many Christians are unaware at how many Baptist churches have female
praise and worship leaders who dance to sexy beats with tight pants and
exposed belly buttons before the congregation. It is later than we think.
And why do these churches do these things? They are "trying to reach
people." You know, "Be made all things to all men..." Where will this
madness end? Will people ever tire of stretching the limits of these
verses in 1 Corinthians 9?

The latest news report is that some professing Christians have become
DRUIDS under the guise of "reaching out to the un-churched":

"DOWNINGTOWN, Pa. - Two Episcopal priests face possible punishment from
the church after it was discovered that they were leaders of a local
society of Druids, people who follow a pre-Christian practice of
worshipping the sun and venerating the Earth. While directing parishes in
Malvern and Downingtown, the Rev. Glyn Ruppe-Melnyk and the Rev. William
Melnyk, a married couple, were also spiritual guides to local
Druids....Ruppe-Melnyk, rector of St. Francis-in-the-Fields parish in
Malvern, and Melnyk, rector of St. James' Church in Downingtown, said in
letters to Bishop Charles Bennison of the Diocese of Pennsylvania that
their involvement in Druidism was an effort to 'help others who had lost
connection to the Church to find a way to reconnect'..."
(Nov. 5th, 2004, www.NBC10.com)

I believe that more sin is excused under the phrase, "Helping others who
have lost connection to the church to find a way to reconnect," than
probably any other words in modern times. We are to believe that the best
way to pull someone out of the ditch is to back up into the ditch with
them! This modern version of Christianity is not helping people in the
world become Christians; it is making Christians worldly! I suppose it
will all culminate in many Baptist pastors playing bongo drums amidst a
crowd of witchdoctors and animists, with their immodestly clad, female
praise and worship leaders dancing to their beat like the daughter of
Herodias, while the Pope prays, "To the God of us all." This pagan jam
session will be to 'help others who have lost connection to the Church to
find a way to reconnect.' See Revelation 17 for more details.

************************************************************************
THE HEAD-PASTOR MODEL AND THE ANGELS OF REVELATION 2 & 3
************************************************************************

The subject of the "one presiding pastor model" for church government has
become (at least in some circles) a popular and controversial subject. A
"plurality of elders/bishops" is certainly seen in the Bible (Philippians
1:1, Acts 20:17). In a former article, I called attention to the lack of
respect for aged men in churches. But I must confess, I do not think that
"aged men" fully satisfies the meaning of "elders" in many of these
Scriptures. I appreciate the feedback from readers. It appears that, at
times, there was more than one ordained "elder" (the office) serving in
churches. Yet, there are two questions that must be asked here:

1. Was this at all transitional (like many other things in Acts)? 

2. Was there a head-elder/senior pastor who managed the church, even
though assisted by assistant/associate elders?

If a doctrinal tree is grounded in truth, it should be able to show forth
its own fruit. While many dear brethren are sincerely seeking truth on
these matters; there is also a larger rebellious movement, energized by
Satan that is seeking to destroy godly order. The Bible plainly teaches
that authority, in all its realms, will be attacked in the last days. A
spirit of antichrist is gaining ground, as it exalts itself above God's
order, and seeks to destroy godly organization. Against this spirit of
rebellion (those who seek to draw Christians out from godly, local
churches), we will continue to "reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not
endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
themselves teachers, having itching ears..." (2 Timothy 4:2-3).

Notice the heaping of "teachers" (plural) in 2 Timothy 4:3. This heaping
of teachers is not for the purpose of Christian growth. It is for the
purpose of escaping accountability. This movement against accountability
has resulted in broken homes and broken churches. The many warnings to the
saints in the Bible have been despised by too many 20th century
Christians. And along with these warnings, God's commandments and order
have been despised:

"[Pastoral authority] proved to be cumbersome in the post-World War II
emphasis upon acceptance, nonjudgment, and ethical relativity. The
minister who wished to be person-centered was the first to deny that he
had authority."(1)

This was at the same time that the authority of the "man of the house" was
being despised in preparation for the "teenager movement," which would
result in the sexual revolution and rock groups like "The Who" singing,
"Why don't you all just fade away...Talkin' bout my generation...I hope I
die before I get old." The Bible warns that authority (in all its realms)
will be despised in these last days:

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
uncleanness, and DESPISE GOVERNMENT. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled,
they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through
the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean
escaped from them who live in error.
19 While they PROMISE THEM LIBERTY, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.
 
Government (or authority) will be despised in the marriage, in the home (2
Timothy 3:1-2 "disobedient to parents"), in the government, and in the
churches. It is one thing to properly and Biblically stand against an
abuse of authority. It is another thing to rebel against and despise a
God-ordained authority. This rebellious movement will expose itself in
time. It will not lead many souls to Christ. It will not bring deliverance
from the power of sin. It will, in fact, lead to a WITHERING of fruit:

Jude 1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, DESPISE
DOMINION, and speak evil of dignities.
12 ...trees whose fruit withereth...
16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and
their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in
admiration because of advantage.
19 These be they who SEPARATE THEMSELVES, sensual, having not the Spirit.

Notice, that as God's ordained authorities are despised and reproached,
these little cliques are characterized by complaining and murmuring. They
"separate themselves." While it was godly for Reformers to separate
themselves from Rome's totalitarian system; and while it was likewise
proper for Separatists, Methodists and Plymouth Brethren to separate from,
and protest against Anglicanism (with its Romish tendencies), the crafty
Serpent is now swinging Christians to the other extreme in fulfillment of
the prophecies. It is possible to run so far from ungodly Popery and
Nicolaitanism, that we fall off the other side of the boat into
LAODICEANISM ("rights of the people"), which also makes Jesus vomit
(Revelation 3:14-16). It is never any Christian's "right" to despise godly
order and authority.

We see professing Christians every week on their way to bars on the
streets. They say:

"We are having church now. This is church. We are always in church. For
women to be silent in church would mean that they can never talk at all,
since we are always in church."

To such people, we ask, "Who are your elected deacons? When was your last
baptism?" Paul plainly distinguishes the "church" (assembly) from the
"home" and "houses" (1 Corinthians 14:35, 11:22), unless a particular
house happened to be the set meeting place for the church (Romans 16:5).

The day when Christians can no longer meet in open assemblies due to
persecution is fast approaching in America. And it is obvious that it is
getting harder and harder for people to find a godly church. But will the
Lord Jesus pity American Christians at the Judgment Seat who have nice,
air-conditioned automobiles and highways, who maintain they cannot find a
godly church - when earlier generations of Christians crossed the entire
ocean in feeble ships, and endured sickness and storms, in order to
worship? A good church is worth driving to, or even moving to, in order to
attend. God should be loved above Mammon. But many are using the abuses
and evils in many modern churches to justify an attack on the whole,
Biblical "church order." And the Devil knows that if he can attack the
head pastor/bishop (the appointed under-shepherd to Jesus), he can
hopefully scatter the flock.

Local churches and their pastors in these last days are under a tremendous
amount of pressure to compromise or bail out; and many are doing so. In
these days when so many will not endure sound doctrine, and many pastors
are under attack, the Devil is launching what he hopes will be his fatal
dart. He is raising up a movement that says, "The whole idea of a local
church is wrong. And this idea of a head pastor leading a flock is
certainly wrong." Therefore, just when a disciple is growing, putting off
sin, surviving attacks on his or her marriage, and about to really
overcome some Satanic strongholds, some disgruntled person says,
"Hey...why are you even going to church? Jesus hates the local church
concept. It is really Roman Catholic. And this idea of a pastor leading
the church is really Satanic. Come have a picnic with us." The end result
of this poison is often scattered sheep, with no local church
accountability, left prey to the Devil.

While it is true that God is not calling for a stale, man-centered PROGRAM
without POWER, He is also not calling us to a rebellious, self-absorbed
PASSIVITY without any DIVINE PROGRAM or order:

1 Corinthians 14:40 Let all things be done decently and in order.

There is certainly a great need to constantly watch against mistaken views
of pastoral ministry, authority, etc. A godly pastor rules primarily by
example and pulpit teaching, reproof and exhortation. Therefore, hopefully
the reader will forgive a brief digression and disclaimer.

Every area of authority has its ordained realm and limits. To "lord over
the flock" is certainly to sin. But it is also sin for an ordained leader
to be passive in building and "taking care" of the house of God. Leaders
who will not lead (even under the banner of "humility") should sit down.
There is also the erroneous view that sees the pastor as the ONLY one
called to do evangelistic (or visitation) work. Associated with this idea
is that missionaries are "hired" to witness on foreign fields, and the
pastor is "hired" to witness at home! And once everyone has been "paid,"
the individual church member thinks that his/her responsibility in regard
to the Great Commission has been fulfilled. May God indeed convict and
shake up any churches that hold such views.

There is a Biblical balance between the mistaken, extreme ideas about the
pastor on one side, and the unstructured, unmanaged, disorderly ideas on
the other side. I believe that this proper balance has been achieved in
thousands of godly churches throughout history. And in this regard, we
should not "meddle" with them who are given to change (Proverbs 24:21).
For example, we should examine Charles Spurgeon's church in the 19th
century. Spurgeon allegedly had other "elders" appointed to help him
assist in the managing of the church. And as will be seen, he also
believed in the active involvement of every member in evangelism and
prayer. He taught the Baptist truth that every member is a priest, and
that pastors must not get "big-headed":

"Our office, as pastors, deserves to be respected, and will be if properly
carried out; but I have observed that some who are very anxious to magnify
their office, really try to magnify themselves."

However, he also preached against those who would decry the "one man"
system:

"The outcry against a 'one man ministry' cometh not of God, but of proud
self-deceit. [Some] will not submit themselves to the authorities which
God Himself appointed....He says, 'Obey them which have the rule over
you.' Brethren, I warn you, there is a spirit abroad which would pull down
the men whom God Himself has appointed....WE ENTER OUR SOLEMN PROTEST
AGAINST THAT SPIRIT WHICH, UNDER PRETENSE OF LIBERTY TO ALL, SETS ASIDE
THE INSTRUMENTALITY BY WHICH THE LORD WORKS....Where is there a single
church which has existed for fifty years where God's chosen
instrumentality of ministry has been despised or rejected. 'Ichabod' is
written upon their walls. God rejects them because they reject God's
chosen way of working..."
(C. H. Spurgeon, 1881)

It is clear that the whole church assembly has authority in calling and
removing members, etc. (i.e. Matthew 18, 1 Corinthians 5, etc.). The
God-called pastor is given to teach and train the church to make godly
decisions, and to lead and manage the flock toward Biblical procedures and
goals. A church is free to elect as many elders/bishops as it needs to
assist the pastor. Yet, the wisdom of Scripture would teach that each
church be managed (with all its officers) by the presiding elder (in
submission to Jesus):

"The attempt to secure a plurality of elders at Haldane's Tabernacle 'did
not succeed' and Robert Haldane was to say in 1821 that 'the system did
not work.'....It is far too simple to claim, as the modern upholders of
'body ministry' have done, that the move away from regular, appointed
ministers of the Word is the result of a new spiritual understanding and
liberty. The claim might not be made with such confidence if its promoters
knew a little more church history....It seems to be a mistaken view of the
New Testament which supposes the leadership of one individual in a
congregation is unlawful."
(Ian Murray, "The Problem of Eldership and its Wider Implications")

Many are the reports of contractors who will no longer even deal with
Christian churches! They say the whole process of approval is absurd. The
slightest decision must pass through five committees, then to the deacons,
and then to the women's board for final approval! The modern pastor is
there to tell jokes so no one will get frustrated during all this red
tape. And once everyone has given their opinion on how many lightbulbs to
buy, one elderly man pouts because his counsel was not followed by the
deacons. Six women are in a fight over the color of the bulbs, and soon
the whole church splits. The pastor gets the final blame since he
obviously did not tell enough jokes to keep everyone lighthearted and
"loving"!

I believe the proper balance has also been maintained in the following
book by J.E. Conan, from which I will quote extensively below.

J.C. Massee (pastor of Tremont Baptist Temple) wrote in the introduction
to J.E. Conant's, "Every-Member Evangelism" (1922):

"Surely no right conception of the Christian ministry can degenerate into
an itching ear for entertainment....[Without intense evangelistic
activity] the ministry becomes formal, the church cold, the world
indifferent....The Christian church today needs a revival of praying,
preaching, and personal testimony to the intent of reaching and winning
the lost to a living faith in the Lord Jesus Christ." (2)

The author, J.E. Conant, writes:

"[Evangelism] is generally understood to consist principally of formal,
public Gospel discourses, delivered in some meeting-place....The New
Testament, however, as illustrated by the events of Pentecost...makes
public and formal witnessing the CLIMAX and CULMINATION of...private and
informal witnessing....We can never be kept at work very long without a
program....The Great Commission absolutely demands that the soul-winning
work of the Church be organized and carried on according to a
program....[The pastor] is to feed his people and give them such
watch-care as will make them strong and vigorous for their service of
soul-winning, and he is to be their overseer, or superintendent, in that
service, seeing that they do that work and guiding them wherever they may
need it, that they may do it successfully....Christian people will go out
of a service saying they cannot possibly understand how it is that the
lost do not yield under such preaching as their pastor does. But the
reason is very simple. A sermon to the lost is to be the climax of
something that has preceded, and if that something has not preceded [if
people do not pray and do the individual, private witnessing] there is not
likely to be any climax, no matter how earnestly the appeal of the
preacher. The pastor has failed simply because the people have failed
behind him. If we do not systematize our witnessing and carry out the
Program the Holy Spirit has laid down for us we must expect defeat and
failure in our work....[Satan, in history] worked the witnessing out of
the hands of the 'laity,' until it was finally regarded as the exclusive
right of the 'clergy.' Then came the Devil's Millennium which history
calls the Dark Ages!....No wholesale house could ever be run on such a
program, and no more can the church of the living God! Suppose it should
be considered the duty of the sales manager...to go out and do all the
selling...while the salesmen support him by their encouragement and their
faithful attendance on his weekly lectures....How long do you think that
house would last?....The pastor is not 'employed' by a church, for he is
not the church's 'hired man.' He is 'employed' by God, the Owner of the
business, and taken care of out of his own treasury, the funds which are
administered by the church. No pastor is ever 'paid a salary' out of the
pockets of the people while he does their witnessing and soul-winning work
for them; he is given a 'support' out of the treasury of the Lord, while
he gives his whole time to perfecting the members in the art of witnessing
and soul-winning..."(3)

In regard to Spurgeon, Conant writes:

"We have all marveled at the great numbers brought to Christ under
Spurgeon's wonderful ministry, and the most of us have supposed that of
course it was Spurgeon's preaching. But that was only a part of the
secret. The other part of it was the fact that once a year, for many
years, three thousand and more of his members came forward in a church
service, and, in a most solemn pledge, took his hand in token that for
another year, they would together give themselves to the work of taking
Christ to the lost. The result was that Spurgeon never stood up to preach
without looking into the faces of scores of unsaved people to whom his own
members had been witnessing to Christ in their own homes....Like Peter's
sermon on the Day of Pentecost, Spurgeon's sermons were the climax of the
witnessing to Christ that had preceded..."(4)

Some have also written of the great dedication Spurgeon's church members
had in praying for the lost and for the sermons before each Sunday. In
short, Spurgeon had an active church. And this should be the goal and
continual prayer of every pastor.
     
But let us return to the question of plural eldership in early churches.
It cannot be debated that in post-Apostolic times, there was a head bishop
that managed the local church together with other elders and deacons. We
know that this system was later perverted into the extremes of Romanism.
But is there not also a danger of throwing out the baby with the
bathwater? Was the problem that the whole concept of a head-elder is
wrong, or is it that the true framework was perverted to unbiblical
extremes? I believe that Rome perverted a true framework (just as she also
erroneously corrupted the truths concerning the Judgment Seat of Christ
and Millennial exclusion into Purgatory).

But let us now go back to Apostolic times (i.e. Biblical times). The last
book of the Bible to be written was the Book of Revelation. And by this
time, at least, we plainly have a head-elder system. If we study the Book
of Acts, concerning James, it could be argued that this system was in
place earlier (see Acts 21:18, 15:19). This view, of the one-head pastor,
does not at all preclude the possibility of plural eldership. Multitudes
of fruitful, mature churches have soon discovered the need to elect
visitation pastors/elders, assistant pastors, etc. Therefore, the
existence of multiple elders is not an argument against a head-elder
managing the church. But let us notice the teaching of our Lord Jesus in
the Book of Revelation:

Revelation 2:1 Unto THE ANGEL of the church of Ephesus write; These things
saith he that holdeth the SEVEN STARS IN HIS RIGHT HAND, who walketh in
the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

The seven stars are the seven angels:

Revelation 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my
right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. THE SEVEN STARS ARE THE
ANGELS OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest
are the seven churches.

Whatever prophetic pictures are observed in these churches, we should
never forget that they were seven, literal, historic churches, and each
had a literal angel. The "star" is the figure. Therefore, the "angel"
(which is the answer to the symbol) cannot be a symbol itself. The word
"angel" means "messenger":

"A human messenger with a divine commission; a pastor or bishop; as 'the
angel of the church,' Rev. 1."
(Standard Dictionary of the English Language, 1895)

"Literally, a messenger...A minister of the gospel, or pastor; as the
angel of the church at Ephesus."
(Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1956)

"Title of pastor or minister of the church."
(Oxford Dictionary)

"Literally, a messenger; one employed to communicate news...A minister of
the gospel, who is an ambassador of God. Rev. ii. and iii."
(Webster's 1828)

Many commentators hold that Epaphroditus was the senior pastor of the
Philippian church. He is referred to as their "messenger" (Philippians
2:25).

Indeed, God has heavenly messengers AND earthly messengers. The things
addressed to the angels of the seven churches can only apply to one who
has authority and responsibility ON EARTH, in regard to the church:

Revelation 2:3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake
hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

The things Jesus says to these angels could not be said of any heavenly
being. We must also remember that this Book of Revelation was a coded book
to Christians, written during a time of Christian persecution. In 1865,
Joseph Seiss writes:

"....we find all addressed to the MINISTERS in charge of the churches.
Each epistle is written to the 'angel' of the church....It shows that
there is a ministry - an official order - in the Christian church, which
assigns one angel to each congregation, and makes him its representative
and head....A special ministerial appointment is recognized...which no
power on earth may disturb without insurrection against God, and invasion
of the dignity of our Lord."(5)

D.M. Panton, in 1925, also sees the "angel" as the pastor of the church:

"Very solemnly our Lord rebukes a CHURCH OFFICER for neglecting to enforce
this rule [i.e. in 1Corinthians 14:34,  that women must be silent in mixed
assemblies of the church]...(Rev.2:20). They alone hold the true custody
of woman's honour who counsel her to obey her God."(6)

Robert Govett, in 1861, writes concerning the seven angels (or pastors):

"They [the angels] are dependent on him, and accountable to him. The
charge concerning the state of each church is given to them, as though he
held them responsible. But His power over them is supreme. He holds them
in His hand. As one has well said,- 'If they be faithful, none can pluck
them out of His hand: if unfaithful, none can deliver them out of
it.'....The angels are stars: He is the sun. Stars, lamps, and sun give
light....John the Baptist and our Lord are by Malachi called by the Hebrew
word which signifies 'angel.' [Malachi 3:1]...The priest and the prophet
are sometimes called by this name [Malachi 2:7, Haggai 1:13, Isaiah
44:26]....They are entitled 'angels of the churches,' as Hengstenberg
remarks, because they were sent of God to the churches, to be guardians of
them....As the angel of the little one [Matthew 18:10] is he to whom he is
committed by God, so is the angel of the church that overseer to whose
presidency the church is by our Lord committed....Some regard them as
angelic beings presiding over churches....But this cannot be; for the
angel of Smyrna is required to be faithful unto death...And angels do not
die....THE ONLY EXPLANATION WHICH MEETS WITH EASE ALL THE CONDITIONS OF
THE CASE, IS THAT WHICH SUPPOSES THEM TO BE PRESIDENTS, SUPERINTENDENTS,
OR CHIEF MINISTERS OF THE CHURCHES. They were bishops, not of diocese, but
of a city-church....One scheme of government appears to run through the
various arrangements of God. In the civil history of Israel in the
wilderness, under the Jewish monarchy, in the hierarchy of the temple of
Solomon, and in the hierarchy of the heavenly sanctuary....There was, I
believe, a divinely-appointed form of church government....Each church has
its angel: THERE IS BUT ONE ANGEL TO EACH CHURCH. Each angel is
independent of the other. There is no epistle to the 'angel of the seven
churches.' Each ruled the one church found in each of the seven
cities....That there was one organization of the same kind, in each church
which had arrived at its completeness, may, I think, be fairly deduced
from the case of Ephesus, the first of the seven....That church began by
Paul's reasoning in the synagogue, and persuading some. Acts 18:19-21.
Apollos comes tither soon after, and he builds up the disciples
(24-28)....Paul visits Ephesus a second time...he separates the disciples,
and the church in Ephesus is formed. Acts 19:1-10. He stays there two
years, during which time officers would be needed, and were certainly
appointed....That we are not deceived in this, the next mention of Ephesus
proves; for when the apostle goes up to Jerusalem and takes leave of the
church, he sends for 'the elders' of Ephesus. Acts 20:16-17....Then comes
the final step. One was set by Christ, as the president, or apostle, or
ruler of the whole - 'the angel of the church in Ephesus.' The
organization was complete." (7)

The arguments against the seven angels being the head-pastors of each of
these churches appear to be shallow. The argument that there is not enough
said about the head pastor could also be made about many other doctrines.
I believe the passages concerning a plural eldership are easily answered
without removing the senior-pastor model. And, as we have seen, evidence
for this model is found in the last, Biblical address to the churches (the
words of Jesus in the Book of Revelation). This teaching is also implied
in Paul's later Epistles to Timothy and Titus. And the AV's notes concur
with the same:

"The second epistle unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the
church of the Ephesians..."

Concerning the apparent plurality of elders in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
we must remember that this epistle was not addressed to a single church,
but to "Hebrews" in general:

Hebrews 13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account,
that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable
for you.

There were multiple churches in Judaea (Galatians 1:22). Therefore,
Hebrews is addressed to multiple churches. The same thing applies to 1st
Peter (see 1:1, 5:1). There are therefore only three or four texts which
clearly speak of a plurality of elders in ONE local church (Philippians
1:1, James 5:14, Acts 20:17, etc.). Yet, we have already seen that a
plurality of elders does not preclude the possibility of a head-elder in
each local church. Along with this is the fact that churches are in a
state of growth. History and experience reveals many churches that were
planted years before a consistent, senior pastor was called.

In conclusion, if it isn't broke, let's not try to fix it. Let's beware of
trying to reinvent the wheel. It is my view that the Plymouth Brethren
would have done better to leave the Anglican churches and join themselves
to Baptist churches, or follow the Baptistic model followed by Robert
Govett (who also left the Church of England). They were never symbolized
with Rome or any of Rome's daughters. We do not need a new church
government. We need revival in those who have been called to pastor the
flock. We need a revival in every church member to see the individual
responsibility each Christian has in relation to evangelism and private
exhortation, encouragement, etc.  Pastors need an awareness that they are
called by Jesus Christ. We are in His hands. And He will preserve us, or
CRUSH us, at His own will, as we deserve. Let us tremble before Him and
get busy training up disciples to be soul winners! We need men to not
neglect the ministry that they have been called and sent out to fulfill.
Satanic distractions and excuses abound. But they will not profit us one
bit at the Judgment Seat of Christ. No pastor who has buried his talent in
the earth will be able to say to the Lord Jesus, "I was too humble to
pastor. I therefore buried my ministry in the heart of the earth." They
just might soon find THEMSELVES in the heart of the earth!

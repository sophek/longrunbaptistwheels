            Modern Attacks on the Doctrine of the Trinity
The KJV presents the doctrine of the Trinity in all its fullness. With a KJV, the Christian is able to resist ALL assaults on the Trinity doctrine, whether they come from Jehovah Witnesses or Oneness Pentecostals. This fact should cause people such as James White to reject the new bibles. He wrote:

"Is it true that some translations are 'stronger' and others 'weaker' on the doctrine of the deity of Christ? Yes, it is. In fact, one aspect of a translation that I check upon reviewing any new translation of the
Scriptures is how it handles the classical passages on the deity of Christ."
("The King James Only Controversy," p.196)

The KJV is stronger on the Deity of Christ and the Trinity in general. However, I find it interesting that White chose to "attempt" to defend new bibles in regard to the "deity of Christ" rather than in regard to the doctrine of the Trinity as a whole. The Trinity doctrine presents Christ as fully UNITED with God as God, yet also fully DISTINCT from the Father and the Holy Spirit, as a separate Person (e.g. 1John 5:7). Thus, it is not enough to simply present Christ as "Divine" in a few places. Even the Jehovah Witnesses claim Jesus is "a" god. On the other hand, Oneness Pentecostals also see Jesus as God, yet deny that He is distinct from the Father or the Holy Spirit (as a separate Person of the Godhead). Therefore, although one can find a few verses that show the Deity of Christ in new bibles, one cannot CLEARLY PROVE the Biblical doctrine of the Trinity from them.

The doctrine of the Tri-une Godhead can be seen throughout the Scriptures. There is one verse in particular that OPENLY states BOTH the Unity and Tri-unity of God:

1 John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

You cannot get any clearer than that! In the above verse it is revealed that God is ONE, yet you also see that He is a "Trinity" of THREE distinct Persons.

In witnessing to J.W.'s, (since their organization used the KJV for a number of years), one will often find them boastfully professing to be able to prove their doctrines from the KJV. They maintain this, of course, until they find out that the person they are seeking to convert has READ the KJV. At that point, they will be quick to backtrack, and explain the "errors" that are found in the KJV.

In their "bible" (the NWT), 1John 5:7 reads:

"For there are three witness bearers."

Notice, they completely removed the Trinity doctrine. At that point, the Christian can explain that he or she does not mess with "new" so-called "bibles". The J.W'.s may not admit it openly, but since their organization attempted to use the KJV for so long, it really makes them a bit "nervous" that they had to write a new bible to prove their doctrines.

Other new bibles also remove or obscure proof-texts for the Trinity, making it more difficult to debate Jehovah Witnesses (who do not believe that Jesus is God). Notice the NIV's version of 1 John 5:7:

"[7] For there are three that testify:"

By removing the Trinity, this verse is forced to be linked with verse 8.

The NAS also removes the Trinity (to the delight of the JW's):

"[7] And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth."

Yet there is more! The KJV also proves the Deity of Christ in 1 Timothy 3:16:

1 Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

Notice, the KJV says that GOD was manifest in the FLESH. The JW "bible," therefore, immediately goes to work. It states:

"Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admitted great: 'He was made manifest in the flesh..."

Of course, "he" is not necessarily "GOD." Therefore, the Trinity is obscured by the JW's. Not to be outdone, the NIV (etc.) goes right to work:

"[16] Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels,..."

The KJV answers these attacks with 1 John 3:16:

1 John 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

Here the KJV reveals that GOD laid down His life for us! The JW's, of course, cannot allow such a reading. Their "bible" (NWT) says:

"By this we have come to know love, because that one surrendered his soul for us..."

Again, "one" is not "GOD"! The NIV (etc.), not to be outdone by the NWT, echoes with the same:

"1JN 3:16 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers."

The Jehovah Witness rejoices in such a reading.

Notice one last example. The KJV reads:

Micah 5:2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from
everlasting.

The NIV reads:

MIC 5:2 "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. "

What a difference! Everlasting is sometimes used in a relative sense, but why INTERPRET it and MAKE it relative? To do so once again obscures the doctrine of the Deity of Christ.

It is crucial that one understand that the J.W.'s denial of the Deity of Christ is not the only attack on the doctrine of the Trinity. The Oneness Pentecostal movement (founded in 1913) attacks the Trinity from a different angle. They believe that God is ONLY one; they therefore deny ANY distinction between the Person's of the Trinity. They teach that God simply manifests Himself through in the three offices of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. This movement is growing in popularity. Charismatic leaders such as T.D. Jakes embrace the doctrine.

Thus, the Christian needs the KJV verses on the plurality of the Godhead as much as he or she needs verses proving the Deity of Christ. Those in the UPC movement applaud the verses proving the Deity of Christ. They believe Jesus is God. They simply do not believe there is ANY distinction between the Son and the Father (other than differing manifestations).

The KJV is ripe with as many verses proving the distinction between the Persons of the Trinity (Godhead), as it is in proving the unity of the Persons. Thus, the KJV protects the seeker from falling into the UPC trap.

Advocates of the new bibles lose many "converts" due to the new bible's deleting or obscuring of 1John 3:16, 5:7, 1Tim.3:16, etc. 1st John 5:7 clearly STATES the doctrine of the Trinity in its fullness; it therefore does more than just suggest or imply it. In defense, advocates of the new bibles do their best to comfort their nervous supporters. Two or three verses are used to show that the new bibles are not "opposed" to the Deity of Christ. It is then revealed that the KJV does not present the deity of Christ as clear in these verses as the new bibles do. Notice Titus 2:13 in a KJV:

Titus 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

The "and" is open for interpretation. Nevertheless, if it is maintained that it is teaching a distinction between God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, then this is STILL a positive addition to one's list of verses proving the Biblical doctrine of the Trinity. The Trinity is just as much a doctrine of "distinction" between the Person's of the Godhead, as it is their "unity." Now I ask, what positive contribution does the NIV make to the doctrine of the Trinity in 1 John 3:16, 5:7, and 1 Tim.3:16? There is no contribution at all. It undermines the doctrine. This is why James White chose to defend the NIV (etc.) in regard to the "deity of Christ," instead of the Trinity in general. That way, anytime the KJV appears to present the plurality of the Godhead (a valuable contribution), White can attempt to use it to his advantage. Yet, this would not appear to be any advantage at all if White attempted to defend the full doctrine of the Trinity from the new bibles.

Therefore, there is one thing you will NEVER see. You will never see an "educated" advocate of new bibles claiming that modern bibles present the whole doctrine of the Trinity AS CLEAR as the KJV. If this is ever
maintained, it will be a bold-faced lie. Thus, since New-Agers, Theosophists, and even the JW's see Jesus Christ as "a god", it would be more correct to say that new bibles attack the full doctrine of the Trinity, rather than simply the "deity of Christ." It is indeed a fact that Christ's glory and Divinity is often diminished in new bibles. Nevertheless, there is enough of His deity left in place to enable other heresies (such as that of Oneness Pentecostalism) to thrive. We are not, therefore, ignorant of the Devil's devices.

Oneness Pentecostalism Refuted

It is not difficult to refute Oneness Pentecostalism. For example, such verses as Colossians 1:2 in a KJV should be enough:

Colossians 1:2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

With the phrase "and the Lord Jesus Christ," it is difficult to understand how anyone could fail to see, that even though Jesus is fully God, and one with the Father, He is nevertheless also distinct! Notice some more Bible passages that reveal a distinction between the Persons in the Godhead:

Daniel 7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

Verse 13 shows that there is clearly a distinction between the Son of Man and the Ancient of Days. The UPC advocate would have to maintain that all of this is only symbolism.

Notice another passage:

Revelation 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.

Here again, although there is some symbolism, the Lamb is clearly shown as distinct from the One sitting on the throne.

Stephen's testimony also refutes the heresy:

Acts 7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

Here Stephen saw Jesus AND God the Father. The UPC advocate would have to say this is all figurative. But if the "right hand" is only figurative, it must be elsewhere as well:

Mark 15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

Would the Oneness people maintain that the thief was a "manifestation" or "title" of Jesus and not distinct from Him? Of course not. Yet, they would have to maintain this if they will claim that the "right hand" is only a figurative expression (see also Mt.10:37,40).

Hebrews chapter 1 is even clearer. It shows a discourse between two Persons of the Trinity. It would be absurd to say this is only one Person having a conversation between the differing "manifestations" or "titles" of Himself:

Hebrews 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

Thus, this ancient heresy of modalism, taught by UPC advocates, is rebuked by these Scriptures.

In defense of their position, Oneness advocates must create a straw man. They must pretend that Trinitarians believe in three "gods." Yet, to do so, they must ignore the Trinity doctrine as traditionally stated by Christians. Trinitarians believe that God is ONE, but that this ONE GOD is in THREE Persons. Oneness people will at that point claim that such a concept does not "make sense." They will do this, while they are at the same time telling us that all the verses that speak of a plurality of Persons in the Godhead must not be interpreted according to our own understanding! It is one thing to say that there are things that God has revealed about Himself that we cannot fully understand. It is quite another to say, as most UPC advocates do, that we are to "turn off our minds" when we come to the Scriptures! The former would be Christian humility (Rom.11:33,34). The latter is Eastern Mysticism (2Thess.3:2).

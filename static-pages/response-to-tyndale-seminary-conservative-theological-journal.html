            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Response to Tyndale Seminary (Conservative Theological Journal)</strong></p>
Charles H. Ray, the Associate Editor of "The Conservative Theological Journal" (August 2005; Tyndale Seminary, Fort Worth: pp.268-269), has written a review of my book "The Rod: Will God Spare It?"

After stating the full title and general teaching, Ray writes:
<blockquote>Jody Dillow and Zane Hodges hold to similar views. The book is endorsed by several, including George Dollar and Robby Dean. Several passages are listed and explained in support of this teaching (often called kingdom-accountability), yet only two will be discussed in this review. One such verse is 2 Timothy 2:12, 'If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us (NASB; all of the quotes in the book are from the KJV which makes reading this volume all the more difficult).</blockquote>
I wonder what Mr. Ray means by "difficult"? Is he saying that the King's English is harder to understand? Or is he saying that he has become so used to newer versions that he can no longer bear with the Authorized Version? It is hard to imagine why a theologian from a seminary called "Tyndale" would find reading a book that quotes from the KJV difficult. All of the older sermons, books, debates, etc., use this Bible. If he means that it is more difficult to understand, then he should read the documentation that proves that the AV is actually on a lower grade reading level than the modern versions.

Ray writes:
<blockquote>"At first glance it appears that this verse teaches that Christians must suffer now in order to reign with Christ later. That is not the proper understanding of this passage. It is a first class conditional, and thus it is very likely the ei has the sense of "since." Christians will suffer; of that there is no doubt (John 15:18,19). Even if Faust's interpretation were true, all Christians will be in the Kingdom because all suffer."</blockquote>
Ray missed the fact that "suffer" is contrasted with "deny":
<blockquote><em><strong>2 Timothy 2:12</strong></em> If we SUFFER, we shall also reign with him: if we DENY him, he also will deny us:</blockquote>
It is not Biblical or even historical to maintain that every believer will confess Christ when tried, or threatened:
<blockquote><em><strong>Matthew 10:28</strong></em> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. 32 Whosoever therefore shall CONFESS me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 33 But whosoever shall DENY me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</blockquote>
<blockquote><em><strong>John 12:42</strong></em> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many BELIEVED on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not CONFESS him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</blockquote>
No, every believer does not suffer for Jesus when tried or tested by the world or by the Devil. Such an idea would turn us into passive robots, and it greatly disarms the saints of the warnings they need in the midst of their trials.

If the "if" in 2 Timothy 2:12 should read "since," should the next "if" in 2 Timothy 2:13 also read "since"?:
<blockquote><em><strong>2 Timothy 2:13</strong></em> IF we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</blockquote>
Is this really supposed to read, "Since we believe not..."? Of course not! And neither does 2 Timothy 2:12 read or mean that every believer will suffer against sin and the world when tested.

Does James 2:18 also mean that all believers will fulfill the royal law?:
<blockquote><em><strong>James 2:8</strong></em> IF ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</blockquote>
All believers do not love their neighbors as themselves.

Would Mr. Ray also maintain that every Christian is faithful unto death?:
<blockquote><em><strong>Revelation 2:10</strong></em> Fear none of those things which thou shalt SUFFER: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: BE THOU FAITHFUL unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</blockquote>
If every believer is automatically faithful to endure sufferings and hardships rather than deny Jesus or shame Him, why then did Christ command these Christians to be faithful? And why did Peter write the following?:
<blockquote><em><strong>1 Peter 3:14</strong></em> But and IF YE SUFFER for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and BE NOT AFRAID of their terror, neither be troubled;</blockquote>
Will every believer automatically stand without fear? It is often possible, when motivated by fear, to escape persecution by compromising our obedience or convictions. Paul writes 2 Timothy 2:12-13 so that believers will think twice before compromising.

History reveals that early Christians went to their deaths with the hope of 2 Timothy 2:12 on their lips. They would have been amazed, as they faced the lions, to know that this promise actually means that every believer suffers, and will surely reign - regardless of his conduct or compromises! Before his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote:
<blockquote>"[Jesus] was crucified, that He might teach us to suffer and to die by His example, that there might be no excuse for a man not to suffer for Him, since He suffered for us; and that since He suffered for the sins of others, much rather ought each to suffer for his own sins. And therefore in the Gospel He threatens, and says: 'Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven; but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.' The Apostle Paul also says: 'For if we die with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.'....Whence the Lord exhorts and strengthens us to contempt of death, saying: 'Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to kill soul and body in Gehenna.'"</blockquote>
And again, he wrote:
<blockquote>"I do not give you orders as Peter and Paul did. They were Apostles; I am a convict. They were free; I am still a slave. But IF I SUFFER I shall be Christ's freedman and in Him I shall rise free."</blockquote>
Certainly, the early Christians did not interpret the "if" in 2 Timothy 2:12 in the same manner that brother Ray interprets it.

Ray writes:
<blockquote>"Another verse given in support of kingdom-accountability is 2 Thessalonians 1:5, 'This is a plain indication of God's righteous judgment so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.' Space does not permit a full analysis of this verse, but two ideas should be kept in mind. First, this verse is dealing with the Thessalonian church, not with individuals. The 'you' in 'you are suffering' is plural. Second, Paul is saying their endurance proves they will attain entrance into the Kingdom; it doesn't make them worthy."</blockquote>
The note about the plural adds nothing to this debate. Multiple saints are being encouraged by kingdom promises to continue in the faith, in the midst of tribulation. In regard to Ray's second note, if "their endurance proves they will attain entrance," then what would it mean if they were not enduring? Were the "brethren" who were not working, and who were living disorderly lives, "enduring"?:
<blockquote><strong>2 Thessalonians 3:11</strong> For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. 14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him AS A BROTHER.</blockquote>
If they were not "enduring," does this mean that these "brethren" will be eternally damned in the Lake of Fire? If they were "brethren," then we know that this cannot be true. Therefore, a few were not enduring. They were warned to repent or be excluded. But if "their endurance proves they will attain entrance," then let Mr. Ray tell us where they will spend the Millennium.

The truth of the matter is that Paul plainly said that these saints were suffering for the Kingdom of God:
<blockquote><strong>2 Thessalonians 1:4 </strong>So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 5 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, FOR which ye also suffer:</blockquote>
Next, Ray writes:
<blockquote>"If nothing else, these examples show the need to study the original languages."</blockquote>
It is amazing how two people can arrive at such opposite conclusions. I was just thinking what a confused mess people often end up with by appealing to the original languages! His appeal to Greek has proved nothing. "If" sometimes means "if it be true" or "since" in English, as Oxford reveals.Yet, I have shown that it does not mean this in 2 Timothy 2:12.

Ray concludes by writing:
<blockquote>"Faust seems to rely on quotes from men rather than on Greek and Hebrew."</blockquote>
To make this charge stick, I believe Ray had to add the words, "rather than on Greek and Hebrew." It would not be a true statement if he had written, "Faust seem to rely on quotes from men rather than on the King James Bible." While my book is filled with many quotes (in answer to the foreseen objection that this truth has never been taught), there are few doctrines that have more BIBLICAL support than Kingdom-exclusion and chastisement for some believers at Christ's return.

        <h1>THE COMMON MAN'S DEFENSE OF KJV ONLYISM - CHAPTER 3 - DID GOD FALL ASLEEP?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            KJV critics have trouble believing that God would care to maintain His Word. Again, this reminds us of the early Deists who did not believe that God cared to actively maintain the natural creation. Is the Bible important enough? Is it precious enough? Holy enough? Obviously, there is much reason to believe that if God would preserve anything, He would preserve His Word!

In regard to Deism, Gerald R. Cragg writes:

"As the eighteenth century began, there was a widespread assumption that the truths of Christianity could and should be made attractive to men of calm and dispassionate judgment....If there is such a thing as revelation, how can we recognize it? The Christians pointed to the 'evidences', as they called them - the unmistakable signs that demonstrate the divine origin of what has been revealed. The Deists, since they increasingly questioned the reality (even the possibility) of revelation, denied the sufficiency of the proofs advanced to support it...The later Deists felt obliged to prove that the New Testament writers were simpletons or knaves, who were either too naive to understand the facts, or wrote what they knew was not true...Deism, though worsted in the controversy, really collapsed through its own inherent weakness...In repudiating revelation and exalting the religion of nature, they believed that they were stripping away unintelligible irrelevances, but they ended by making religion seem commonplace and poor."1

One can insert "perfect, preserved Bible" for "revelation" in the above, and one will see that the controversy is still raging. KJV critics also attempt to appeal to men of "calm and dispassionate judgment"; men that do not mind God "winding up" a perfect Bible in history past, as long as He doesn't continue to preserve it to perfection in the common language of this latter age. Is there a perfect, preserved Bible today? If so, how would we recognize it? KJV Onlyists point to "evidences", - the unmistakable signs that demonstrate that the KJV is indeed the perfect Bible preserved for mankind in the last days. Yet, the KJV critics, since they question the reality, or even the possibility of a perfect, preserved Bible, continue to deny the sufficiency of the proofs advanced to support it. The KJV critics feel obliged to mock the KJV translators (and every Christian that believes they were used by God) as simpletons, too naive to completely understand textual criticism and the original languages. Yet, in repudiating a perfect, preserved Bible, and exalting modern, subjective scholarship, the KJV critics believe they are saving Christianity from a multitude of mistranslations, but end up making Christianity itself seem commonplace and poor. They teach that God has decided to allow errors to creep into the Bible and that these will never be entirely eradicated. Gleason L. Archer writes:

"It may be true that we no longer possess any perfect copy of the inerrant original manuscripts of the Bible. But it is equally true that we have only imperfect copies of the Lord Jesus available to us today...All the observer has to look at now are imperfect representatives and agents of His, in the form of sanctified and committed Christians."2

James R. White agrees:

"The scribes of old made errors, too...They made mistakes in what they were copying, even when they were copying the Scriptures...All of these things contributed to the fact that there is not a single handwritten manuscript of the Bible, in Greek or Hebrew, that does not contain, somewhere, an error, an oversight, a mistake. To err is human."3

D.A. Carson writes:

"All this sounds alarming. If no two manuscripts agree, how can we know what the Holy Spirit inspired the New Testament authors to write? The matter is, on the face of it, very difficultâ€¦Before taking the discussion further, I should pause and set at rest the troubled concern of anyone who, on the basis of what I have written so far, concludes that the manuscript tradition is entirely unreliable, or that we can not really be certain of any of it. There is no need for such rigorous pessimismâ€¦Many of the theologically significant variants can be sorted out quite easily by comparing manuscript with manuscript. The result, as I shall try to show, is a certain word from God."4
We can be sure we have a "certain word from God"? That is a far cry from being sure we have the perfect, preserved WORDS of God! These men toss around phrases such as "entirely reliable". Such phrases can mean anything. These KJV critics are doing their best to make their readers "feel better" after telling them that God has not preserved His WORDS in one place. Supposedly they are scattered to and fro throughout various, imperfect manuscripts, and only the skilled textual critic can even begin to find them. The common people will never entirely buy this idea. It is absurd. It makes religion a sham. Christ said "beware of the scribes" (Mark 12:38). How can Christians protect themselves from scribes if the sword of the Spirit is broken?
The old Deists believed that God wound up the universe and then left it to run on its own through natural law. Yet, Scripture tells us that the Holy Spirit is still working behind natural processes:

Matthew 10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

Matthew 5:45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

The Deists were wrong. They claimed that God is no longer involved in running His universe. Yet, the above Scriptures teach otherwise. They show that God is still working through and behind the "natural laws" of His creation. He has not left it all to run on its own.

It is interesting that saved KJV critics believe much like the old Deists believed. Perhaps KJV critics should be called "Christianized Deists." They believe that God wound up His Word and got it going in the original manuscripts, but that afterwards, He left it to man to permanently corrupt.

Notice another "anti-Deism" Scripture. Notice how it not only reveals that God is active and present in the intricacies of His natural creation, He is also actively involved in preserving His Word:

Isaiah 40:7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.
8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

God is even involved in the natural act of a flower fading! Who then, in his right mind, could believe that if God is so involved in a flower, that He would not be active in preserving His Word? God's Word shall stand for ever. God is not asleep. He will actively insure that it continues to stand. He has exalted His Word above His name! The Bible is obviously one of the most important things in the whole universe:

Psalms 138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.

Psalms 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

The Bible itself promises that God will preserve His words. Christianized Deism is wrong. God did not wind up the Bible and permanently turn it lose in the hands of man. If man corrupts His Word, He is able to restore it to perfection:

Jeremiah 36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.

Here we see that God is not bound by the sins and errors of men. He can preserve His Words by restoring them when men have corrupted them, through frailty or sin:

Exodus 34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

God has always been actively involved in preserving His Word. He is able. He is not asleep today. The grave could not bind the Living Word of God Himself. He resurrected. Why then do so many think that human error can bind the Written Word of God? Nothing can bind it as long as God is still God!:

Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

2 Timothy 2:9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

The Word of God is living. It is not even bound by its original, ancient languages:

Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

The early Deists argued against the scriptures and the idea that God worked through men to inspire them. Christians countered these arguments by pointing out how absurd it is for man to argue what God would or would not do. Joseph Butler (1692-1752) states:

"There are persons, who think it a strong objection against the authority of Scripture, that it is not composed by rules of art, agreed upon by critics, for polite and correct writing...Now, if the natural and the revealed dispensation of things are both from God, if they coincide with each other, and together make up one scheme of Providence, our being incompetent judges of one, must render it credible that we may be incompetent judges also of the other. Since, upon experience, the acknowledged constitution and course of nature is found to be greatly different from what, before experience, would have been expected...This renders it beforehand highly credible, that they may find the revealed dispensation likewise, if they judge of it as they do of the constitution of nature, very different from expectations formed beforehand; and liable, in appearance, to great objections: objections against the scheme itself, and against the degrees and manners of the miraculous interpositions, by which it was attested and carried on...And thus we see, that the only question concerning the truth of Christianity is, whether it be a real revelation; not whether it be attended with every circumstance which we should have looked for....in Scripture we are not competent judges, as we are in common books..."5

Butler silenced the Deists by reminding them that their arguments against Christianity and its scriptures are foolish presumptions. How can we dictate the precise manner in which God must communicate to man? When the Deist continued to press his presumptions, Butler simply applied their same objections to nature itself.

We may press Butler's arguments even further and use them to defend the perfection of the King James Bible from the attacks of the modern KJV critic. What objection may be brought against the KJV as God's perfect Word? It is the only Bible in modern times held to be the perfect, infallible Word of God. There is no other biblical manuscript, copy, version or translation esteemed like the KJV. What are the objections against its perfection?

1. God would not preserve His words by causing the King James translators to translate correctly.

Who said He would not? Did He not use fallible men to write the Bible in the first place? Why would He not use fallible men to simply organize and preserve it? Unless God has stated that He would not one day preserve His words through the King James Bible, there is no argument against Him doing so. The only question is whether or not the KJV bears the supernatural marks of God's providence. The KJV critic may argue that it does not. Yet, he cannot argue this on the basis that God would never preserve His words through the KJV. The KJV critic may indeed deny that the KJV bears the supernatural marks of God's providence. But then again, the Deists denied that Christianity itself lacked such evidences!

2. God would never use English. He must always keep His words in the original tongues.

Who said? Where did God ever state that He would never one day use English as the language to preserve His perfect words? The verses concerning preservation state nothing in regard to language. KJV critics start with the assumption that God must preserve His words in Greek and Hebrew; yet there is nothing in the Bible that teaches this.

3. God would never leave us with a perfect Bible. People would be tempted to worship it.

Who said? Where did God ever state that He would not preserve one perfect Bible? Were the original manuscripts of the Bible perfect? Of course! Did the apostles and early saints worship them? No. Then why is it so hard for KJV critics to believe that God would allow us to have a perfect Bible today?

4. KJV Onlyists must prove that the KJV is God's perfect, preserved Word.

Before looking at such proof, let us apply this to the KJV critic's own position. Let the KJV critic prove that God has decided to preserve His words imperfectly through a multitude of conflicting copies, versions, etc. The KJV critics will sometimes state that they believe that the words of God have indeed been perfectly preserved, yet they teach that no one can find them all at one time and place them in one Book. It therefore follows, according to this view, that God's words are not preserved in any real sense! They are not preserved enough to read in one Book. The KJV critic does not believe a person can read, from Genesis to Revelation, every perfect word of God that was found in the originals. How then can he call this "preservation"? Nevertheless, let the KJV critic prove his view of preservation. How will he do it? Will he use a bible that he claims is no longer 100% perfect?

5. There is no real scholar anywhere who believes such a thing!

When did God say that all the latter day scholars would recognize His perfect, preserved words? He didn't. In fact, He never even promised that most of them would recognize it. Christ told us to beware of scribes (Lu.20:46). The Bible promises a great falling away in the last days (2Thess.2:3, 2Tim.3:1-5). In light of these observations, the very fact that not many modern, popular scholars embrace KJV Onlyism is actually one of the best arguments for it!

6. But such and such a verse is mistranslated in the KJV.

The KJV translators did a great work; yet they were mere men. And to err is human!

What is the original, perfect standard one is comparing the KJV to? Who said the multitude of imperfect copies, versions and manuscripts etc., represent a better reflection of the inspired originals than the KJV? In order to correct the KJV, one must assume that the KJV is not a miraculous work of God's providence. Yet, this cannot be rationally assumed since God never told the KJV critic that He would NOT preserve His words in such a manner.

7. But God never said He would preserve His words for the last days through the KJV translators!

God did say He would preserve them (Ps.12:6,7, Lk.21:33). The Bible shows that God preserves by "reviving" (2Kings 22:8, Ex.34:1, Jer.36). This supports the KJV Only position. The KJV is an act of God supernaturally reviving His words in the mainstream. On the other hand, the Bible never shows God preserving His words imperfectly through a multitude of imperfect copies. Where is such a verse? At least the KJV Onlyists can prove their view by observing how God has preserved His words throughout Scripture. Yet, KJV critics do not have any ground for their belief other than the worldly canons of textual criticism commonly applied to ordinary, human books.

8. But where was the perfect, preserved Bible before 1611?

This is an interesting question coming from those who do not believe there has ever been a perfect, preserved "Bible" in over 1700 years! If we answer that it was scattered throughout various, "reliable" manuscripts, versions, etc., we will only be stating what the KJV critic believes. Yet, it is not necessary to trace the perfect, preserved Word of God throughout history in order to believe it is present today. Our responsibility is to find the fullest, most perfect revelation of God in our own day.

9. So people like Luther did not have the perfect, preserved Word of God?

According to KJV critics they did not. Yet, we will leave such questions to the realm of speculation since it is not necessary to know where the perfect, preserved Word of God has been throughout history.

10. Obviously Luther's bible was good enough for him! Why then do we need a perfect, preserved Bible today?
Luther will be judged for the light he had. It is the responsibility of every man to seek the greatest light possible in his own day. If God has indeed given us a perfect Bible in the English language, it is sin against light to reject its witness.

11. But there are conflicting editions of the King James Bible. How then can it be perfect?

In answering this question, the reader must absolutely understand that the so-called "Revised Version" of 1881 is NOT an "edition" of the KJV. Before dealing with the above question in detail, it must be asked why variations in editions prove the KJV is not God's perfect, preserved Word? God never promised that He would not first work through the KJV translators to translate correctly and then work out various printing errors through a few subsequent editions of the KJV (ending well before the start of the 19th century). Was not Christ Himself perfect as a babe? Yet, did He not have to grow up to manhood physically? Did not the perfect, sinless Christ, have another "perfection" to experience (Heb.2:10)? It is therefore reasonable that the written Word of God would be revived to perfection in 1611, and then "grow up" in print and letter style as they stabilized a few years later. Even when Jesus Christ resurrected, there were subsequent "stages" revealed. At first, He would not let Mary touch Him (John 20:17). This is a perfect picture of the written Word of God. In 1611, it resurrected in perfection in the English language. Yet, there were still more stages as the printing caught up and was able to fully represent the original intent of the translators. It is the later edition of the KJV that is held to be the final stage of the perfect, preserved Word of God.

Early "KJV Onlyists" opposed subsequent revisions of the KJV. These revisions were found to be of a different nature than earlier "revisions." For example, in 1857, A. Cleveland Coxe wrote, "An apology for the common English Bible; and a review of the extraordinary changes made in it by Managers of the American Bible Society." Coxe revealed that the American Bible Society was going beyond the earlier revision of Dr. Blaney. Blaney had simply desired to "restore the text of the English Bible to its original purity." He removed printing errors and updated spellings, etc. (There were no standards for spelling in 1611.) Later revisers went way beyond these previous revisions. They assumed that the KJV translators had made mistakes that they needed to correct. Coxe quotes the report from the Board of Managers (1851) in regard to their revision of the King James Bible (which began in 1847):

"â€¦here we find that the committee have desired to restore the English version to its original purity, â€˜saving the necessary changes of orthography, and other like variations which would assuredly be acceptable to the translators themselves were they living at the present dayâ€¦â€™â€¦I do not think they can be quite sure what Bishop Andrewes and others, almost his equals in learning and piety, would have done in 1851, to amend their labours of three centuries ago. I am hardly less surprised at what follows: - â€˜The committee have had no authority, and no desire, to go behind the translators; nor in any respect to touch the original version of the text; unless in cases of evident inadvertence, or inconsistency, open and manifest to all.â€™â€¦"6

Coxe blasts the revisers for arrogance and hypocrisy. He shows that their new "edition" of the KJV is not the same as the earlier revisions, and that they did indeed "go behind the translators". Coxe argues that such minor changes in the AV would open the door to a total apostate revision in less than 30 years:

"Thirty years more, and another generation may see a new experiment, under the sanction of this, which will be carried further; and a vast body of Neologists may entirely control the work of a new translation. Experience demonstrates that I am not a gratuitous alarmist."7

History itself now clearly reveals that Coxe was certainly not a "gratuitous alarmist." His book was published in 1857. In less than thirty years, Brooke Foss Westcott (1825-1901) and Fenton John Anthony Hort (1828-1892) would begin their work of "revising" the KJV, exactly as he predicted (i.e. the RV of 1881). They were precisely the type of men that Coxe had warned about! Since Wescott believed in evolution, he obviously believed that his generation could do a better job than the KJV translators. Wescott writes:
"On the one side our outward life is conditioned by our ancestryâ€¦Each man is at once an individual of a race and a new power in the evolution of the race."8
John Wahnert reminds us:

"It is Wescott and Hort, who were Darwinian evolutionists, who accepted the destructive higher critical position, who were of the party of the Church of England that repudiated the Reformation and desired a return to Rome, and who worshipped Mary. On October 18, 1865, Hort wrote to Wescott: â€˜I have been persuaded for many years that Mary-worship and Jesus-worship have very much in common in their causes and results.â€™[Life, Vol.II, p.50]â€¦It seems difficult for many to realize that Satan does indeed translate the Bible, just as he quotes Scripture."9

D.A. Waite, writes:

"Since Westcott and Hort were heretical in so many areas, their veracity on their theories of the New Testament textual criticism cannot be trusted. Any men who would twist the Bibleâ€™s clear meanings as Wescott and Hort have done in these above areas, cannot be trusted in any other Biblical area as well! The Wescott and Hort THEORY of New Testament Textual Criticism which has dominated the field since the production of the English Revised Version (ERV) of 1881 based on their FALSE GREEK TEXT, cannot be accepted on face value, because the perpetrators of such a theory have been proven to be deceivers and APOSTATES and HERETICS in so many other areas of Bible doctrine."10

In the face of these plain facts, James R. White has the audacity to state:

"KJV Only advocates love to hate B.F. Wescott and F.J.A. Hortâ€¦Entire books have been published that seek to do nothing but vilify these men."11

This is incredible! James White himself goes to great lengths to criticize Peter S. Ruckman for his strong language against those who profess to find mistakes in the KJV.12 Yet, when KJV Onlyists reveal that Wescott and Hort believed in Darwinian evolution, engaged in occult necromancy, 13 and held numerous heresies, they are accused of vilification and hatred! If it is "hatred" to expose men who attack the Deity of Christ and openly pervert the Scriptures, what is it called when one criticizes another for simply using strong language? It would appear that many modern KJV critics desire to sweep the views of Wescott and Hort under the rug. When James R. White does deal with a few of their heresies, he implies that such views are perfectly normal since these men were not "fundamental Baptists". White goes on to write:

"Were they influenced by events in their day, movements, and theological opinions that many would find objectionable? Yes, they wereâ€¦" 14

Thus, White turns heretics into passive victims of their age. Yet, even Wescott and Hort themselves knew that they were heretics in the eyes of Evangelical Christians. In 1861, Hort wrote to Wescott:

"I have a sort of craving that our text should be cast upon the world before we deal with matters likely to brand us with suspicion. I mean, a text, issued by men already known for what will undoubtedly be treated as dangerous heresy, will have great difficulties in finding its way to regions which it might otherwise hope to reach, and whence it would not be easily banished by subsequent alarms." (Life, Vol.I, p.445).

All new translations, from 1881 onward, have been of the same nature as the corrupt RV of Wescott and Hort. Most appear to be motivated by filthy lucre (1Pet.5:2). They are all based on the assumptions that God has not preserved His words to perfection and that there will never be a perfect Bible that Christians can hold in their hands and actually read. Coxe was right when he warned that any tampering with the Authorized Version would bring upon Christendom "great evils". We can now see that he was absolutely correct.
The King James translators finished what men such as Wycliffe and Tyndale had started. Coxe reminds us:
"â€¦it was the Bible which had been winnowed from whatever was unsubstantial in the fruits of all their labours, and which combined the merits of all; it was the finest of the wheatâ€¦"15

But when something is finished, it is finished! The old proverb of Joseph Mede (1586-1638) is correct:
"Over-doing always undoes."16

No other editions of the English Bible were ever blessed by God. The public rejected them; and those that have been received to any extent have produced rotten fruit. These modern translations are based on the theories of Wescott and Hort. These men assumed that the KJV translators did not have the "best" manuscripts from which to translate. They assumed the KJV could be improved upon by using the same textual criticism scholars use with ordinary books. KJV critic D.A. Carson, in his book, "The King James Version Debate" writes:

"But almost universally accepted today is the contention of Wescott and Hort that the Byzantine tradition does not antedate the middle of the fourth century and represents a relatively late conflation. It is on this basis that Bible translations since 1881 have, as compared with the KJV, left out some things and added a few others."17

Thus, Carson admits that modern versions are based on the theories of Wescott and Hort. These men were heretics who denied the inerrancy of Scripture. It is therefore unreasonable to think that God would bless them with any godly wisdom in regard to Bible translation or textual criticism. History reveals that God did NOT bless them with such wisdom. All later "revisions" of the Authorized English Bible have produced nothing but devilish confusion, exactly as the early KJV Onlyists predicted. Coxe in 1857 warned:

"Can it be necessary to argue that no one can inflict a graver wound on the unity of the race, and on all the sacred interests which depend on that unity, under God, than by tampering with the English Bible?â€¦the text, the text, let us have it as our fathers left it! Progress is a good thing in a proper place; but this sewing of a new patch here and there, on a â€˜raiment of wrought goldâ€™ must strike minds as a species of sacrilegeâ€¦â€˜The more they dare, the more adventurous will they grow in daringâ€™â€¦If then they succeed in this venturous experiment, where will their courage make a halt? What next?" 18

It is for this reason that no "revision" of the English Bible in the 19th, 20th or 21st century should be accepted. The modern scholars cannot be trusted. Darwinian evolution and post-millennialism have corrupted their minds. They believe that Bible translations get better and better the closer we get to the final last days. The Bible teaches otherwise:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

Timothy did not have the "original manuscripts." Yet, he had inspired Scripture. Likewise, the Christian today can be "assured" that the Authorized Version is a perfect translation of the inspired Scriptures. God has put His blessing and stamp upon it. Paulâ€™s warning to Timothy was prophetic. Evil men will wax worse and worse. Christians should hold fast to the KJV and reject all other modern translations.

Further objections from KJV critics could be multiplied. Yet, all of them are based on assumptions similar to those raised against Christians by the early Deists. And all of these objections, if turned back on the KJV critics themselves, expose their position to be much more slippery than that of KJV Onlyism.

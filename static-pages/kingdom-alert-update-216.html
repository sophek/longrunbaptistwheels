THE BIBLE'S SCIENTIFIC FOREKNOWLEDGE (Part 4)

*****************************************************

Examples of the Bible's scientific foreknowledge already noted:

1. Differing time zones (daylight on one side of the earth, while it is dark on the other) [Luke 17:30-35]

2. Fire beneath the earth [Job 28:5, Luke 10:15, Matthew 18:9]

3. Digging technology: ability to place colonies beneath the earth [Amos 9:2, Philippians 2:10, Revelation 5:3]

4. Space technology: ability to place colonies in outer space [Obadiah 1:4, Deuteronomy 30:4, Mark 13:27]

5. The earth hangs upon nothing [Job 26:7, 38:4, 6]

6. The water cycle (rivers, and evaporation) [Ecclesiastes 1:7, Amos 9:6, Psalms 135:7]

7. Stars too numerous to count [Jeremiah 33:22, Deuteronomy 4:19]

8. Implant (microchip) technology [Revelation 13:16]

9. Wind circuits [Ecclesiastes 1:6]

10. Ocean currents [Psalms 8:8]

11. The moon shines by reflected light [Job 25:5, 31:26]

12. Satellite television technology [Revelation 11:9-10]

13. Air has weight [Job 28:25]

14. Earth must be exact size to support life [Job 38:4-5]

15. Waters must be in exact proportion and bounds to support life [Job 28:25, Psalms 33:7, Isaiah 40:12, Jeremiah 5:22]

16. There are springs in the sea [Job 38:16]

17. Air is moved (i.e., wind) by sunlight [Job 38:24]

18. Each star differs in glory [1 Corinthians 15:41]

19. The circular shape of the earth [Isaiah 40:22]

20. There is water in outer space [Psalms 148:3]

21. Light is not stationary [Job 38:19]

22. Celestial bodies emit sounds [Job 38:6-7, Psalms 148:3]

Are these amazing wonders simply coincidental? Are we reading modern science into the ancient text? In 1936, Harry Rimmer answers:

"We would be willing to concede six or eight or a dozen of these coincidences, but when they begin to multiply and number scores, SOME OTHER EXPLANATION MUST BE FOUND....for there are in the word of God literally scores of these anticipations of our so-called modern science."
(Harry Rimmer, "The Harmony of Science and Scripture," 1936)

Indeed, after listing forty or fifty wonders, we would simply ask the unbeliever to bring us any other book (e.g. Koran, Vedas, Book of Mormon, or the collected writings of any philosopher or religious leader in history), and show us HALF the number of similar scientific foreknowledge.

The unbeliever would be forced to confess, at the very least, that the HOLY BIBLE is a unique Book on the face of the earth! In fact, we could stand against any other book with an Authorized Version and let the unbeliever pretend that there were no Scriptures before 1611. Many of these wonders have only been discovered or proved by science AFTER 1611!

And most have been scientifically verified in our generation. Thus, as man grows increasingly wicked, the infallible proofs for Christianity continue to INCREASE, heaping greater guilt upon modern man. But how is infidel science faring in comparison? In 1897, the infamous infidel, Robert G. Ingersoll, wrote:

"At first, the Bible was the standard, and all facts inconsistent with that standard were denied. But in a little while science became the standard, and the passages in the Bible contrary to that standard had to be explained or given up....The pious professors twisted and turned but found it hard to reconcile the creation of Adam with the slow development of man from lower forms....For many years the pulpit has been losing influence...."
("Faith Or Fact," 1897)

This was, of course, the wishful thinking of a man who thought decadence was progress. He simply replaced the Christian religion (with all its evidences) with his own fabled religion of "science falsely so-called."

Again, we ask, How is this infidel science faring in comparison to Christianity? Rimmer, in 1936, responds:

"The reader may recall that famous list of fifty-one scientific facts published by the French Academy of Science in 1861, all of which contradicted some statement of Scripture....there is not a living man of science today who holds one of those fifty-one so-called facts that were at one time advanced in refutation of the inspiration of the Scripture."
(Harry Rimmer, "The Harmony of Science and Scripture," 1936)

Let us scorn this infidel religion for arrogant monkey men, and let us, as upright men and women, continue to examine the Bible's remarkable, scientific foreknowledge!

23. THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

==========================================

Psalms 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, ALL OF THEM SHALL WAX OLD LIKE A GARMENT; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

"The second law of thermodynamics [refers to the fact that]...in any energy transfer or change, although the total amount of energy remains unchanged, the amount of usefulness and availability that the energy possesses is always DECREASED. This principle is also called the law of entropy increase....the physical universe is, beyond question, growing old, wearing out, and running down." (Henry M. Morris, "The Bible and Science," 1951)

"...everything tends to deteriorate, order moves toward disorder and all systems tend to wear out....Isn't that amazing again - the second law of thermodynamics clearly stated in the Bible thousands of years before men of science discovered it?"
(Sydney C. Phillips, Creationsciencemessages.com)

=========================

24. THE GENETIC CODE

=========================

Psalms 139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and IN THY BOOK ALL MY MEMBERS WERE WRITTEN, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

Scientists in the 1960's discovered that the DNA molecule is like a WRITTEN message.

"Human code SPELLED OUT in three billion DNA 'letters'....Scientists have finished reading the 'BOOK OF LIFE', the three billion letters of DNA that spell out the recipe of a person. Half a century after scientists in Cambridge first unveiled DNA's double helix molecular structure, an international team yesterday unveiled an accurate DNA recipe - genome - of a human being." (telegraph.co.uk, 2003)

Notice how the media refers to this amazing code as a "book"!

"...our DNA was programmed - much like a computer - in the very beginning of life....How did David know that God had written down his genetic code in a 'book'? After all, this part of the Bible was recorded thousands of years before science learned that the fertilized egg in a mother's womb is programmed with data 'written down' for each cell."
(George Carman, "Science Proves the Bible," 1986)

"To make the system even more incredible we find the complete DNA genetic code is present in every nucleus of every cell of every plant and animal and of course is specific for that kind of plant or animal. To change a fruit fly into a butterfly would present scientific barriers that cannot even be imagined."
(Sydney C. Phillips, Creationsciencemessages.com)

In every one of our 10 trillion cells there are 3 billion bits of DNA. The fact that the Bible says that all our members are written in God's BOOK is amazing in light of the fact that scientists have discovered that man carries a written, programmed code in every cell of his body! And again, the media continue to refer to this code as a "book":

"Row over 'Book of Life'....A row has broken out between the two groups of scientists who have worked out the sequence of the human genetic code....About 30,000 genes are written in our DNA, which is wound up into 46 chromosomes."
(BBC News, Feb. 12, 2001)

Many scientists "resent" this language. They clearly understand that a "code" or a "book" implies a WRITER!

=======================================================

25. THE VISIBLE WORLD CONSISTS OF INVISIBLE ELEMENTS =======================================================

Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not MADE OF THINGS WHICH DO APPEAR.

"The best statement of the atomic theory that literature contains is found in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, in the third verse....Dr. Millikan received the Nobel Prize of almost two score thousand dollars for proving this theory. Paul the Apostle did not receive so much as a dime for anticipating the discoveries of Millikan by eighteen centuries! The point we now raise is, How did Paul the Apostle know of the atom these hundreds of years before men discovered it?" (Harry Rimmer, "The Harmony of Science and Scripture," 1936)

"In other words, the matter of the universe is not ultimately physical, but is composed of something which is not 'apparent.' All the mysterious nonphysical entities with which science deals - energy, electricity, magnetism, waves, gravity, etc. - though intimately related and associated with 'things that are seen,' are in themselves 'things which do not appear.'" (Henry M. Morris, "The Bible and Science," 1951)

=================================

26. ALL FLESH IS NOT THE SAME

=================================

1 Corinthians 15:39 All flesh IS NOT THE SAME flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

Rimmer, when a young lad in school, was once ridiculed by a teacher for being a Christian. The teacher referred to 1 Corinthians 15:39 as "evidence" that Christianity was in error. Yet, the error was in his own science falsely so-called:

"Since we are speaking now of the archaic days of biology, something more than twenty years ago, it might be wise to remind the reader of this famed Continuity Theory. This idea was predicated upon the supposition that all cell structure was the same. Early investigations discovered that the cells of all living creatures contained a basic substance called protoplasm. They jumped to the conclusion that all protoplasm was the same, therefore, that all cells were the same. Thus they built up the evolutionary hypothesis..."
(Harry Rimmer, "The Harmony of Science and Scripture," 1936)

==============================================

27. VALLEYS AND MOUNTAINS ON OCEAN FLOOR ==============================================

Jonah 2:6 I went DOWN to the bottoms of THE MOUNTAINS; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

2 Samuel 22:16 And the CHANNELS OF THE SEA, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.

Job 38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?

In the 1900's oceanographers discovered deep canyons in the oceans. Jonah had already been "in the search of the depth," and told us about the mountain ranges in the seas. Mountains in the seas? Jonah, in the whale's belly, went DOWN to the bottoms of the mountains. But this ancient understanding of the oceans was far in advance of modern science:

<span style="font-size: x-small;">"Before 1850, people guessed the ocean floor was smooth and featureless. Now maps display great mountains and canyons."
(University of Houston, </span><a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.uh.edu/engines/epi363.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.uh.edu/engines/epi363.htm</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Â </span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">"It seems as though there could not possibly be any place left on the planet that is yet to be explored and exploited. Nevertheless THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAINS AND DEEPEST CAVERNS REMAIN UNEXPLORED UNDER THE SEAS, many out of human reach. In fact, 60 percent of the oceans' waters and inhabitants are more than one mile below the surface. This book, a companion to the BBC/Discovery Channel television series and also available on video, is a feast for the eyes..." (</span><a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.Enotalone.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.Enotalone.com</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">, review of "Blue Planet," by By Andrew Byatt, Alastair Fothergill, Martha Holmes, 2002)</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Â </span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">"...surprisingly little is known about seamounts. Says Ron Kaufmann of the University of San Diego, 'There are over 30,000 seamounts in the Pacific Ocean alone, yet only about 100 to 150 have been studied. They are indeed one of the deep mysteries of the sea.'"

<span style="font-size: x-small;">====================================</span>

28. THE EAGLE'S ACUTE VISION

=====================================

Job 39:27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and HER EYES BEHOLD AFAR OFF.

"While humans typically have 200,000 light-sensitive cells per square millimeter of retina, eagles may have 1 million - five times more....where people see just three basic colors, eagles see five, enabling them to pick out even well-camouflaged prey." (PBS.org)

<span style="font-size: x-small;">"Eyesight is the most keenly developed of all the eagle's senses, and the one depended on most by the eagle to survive. They use their vision, above all else to find their food. A fish swims just beneath the water's surface, quietly at the edge of a marsh. The fish is all but invisible in its camouflage. An eagle, riding a river of wind a thousand feet above somehow spots this fish far below....An EAGLE CAN SPOT A FISH FROM TWO OR THREE MILES AWAY." (</span><a href="http://www.fishcorpuschristi.com/eagles.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">http://www.fishcorpuschristi.com/eagles.htm</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The Bible knew this thousands of years ago. Yet, in the 19th century, scientists generally guessed that eagles hunted their prey through an acute sense of smell!:</span>

"The SENSE OF SMELL in birds has afforded subject-matter for much discussion, and great obscurity still exists with reference to the extent to which they make use of their olfactory organs. It has been GENERALLY ASSERTED that birds of prey are gifted with an ACUTE PERCEPTION OF ODOURS, and are THUS ENABLED to discover their food at a DISTANCE..." ("Cassell's Book of Birds," Volume 1. pp 9 - 10, 1869-1873)

=============================================

29. FOREKNOWLEDGE OF STAR CONSTELLATIONS =============================================

Job 38:31 Canst thou BIND the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?

In chapter 38, God asks Job if he is able to do the wonders that He Himself has already accomplished. For example, in verse 35, God asks Job if he can "send lightnings." God can, and does, send lightnings. In verse 8, God asks, "who shut up the sea with doors...?" God is the One who has done this marvelous act of creation. Therefore, in context, when God asks Job, "Canst thou BIND the sweet influences of Pleiades...?" it must mean that He has already BOUND Pleiades. And when He asks if Job can LOOSE Orion, it must mean that HE has loosed them. We should therefore find in modern science that Pleiades is BOUND and Orion is LOOSED. Using high-powered, modern telescopes, this is exactly what we find!:

"We learned in this century that the stars of Pleiades are gravitationally bound and the stars of Orion are not." (ChristianEducation.org)

"The cluster of the PLEIADES is an odd one out as far as star clusters go.

Because of the small amounts of dust and gas between the stars in the cluster, it is called a galactic or open cluster, but unlike many such open clusters, it is not breaking up. It is the classic example of a 'bound' cluster. [i.e. "Frontiers of Astronomy" by Prof. F. Hoyle, p. 236,
238 ff.] The energies of motion of the individual stars cannot ever overcome the 'chains' of gravity and allow them to move away from the cluster. Nor, indeed, is the cluster expanding, as it has been calculated that it would take 1,000 million years to significantly change the diameter of the cluster. [i.e. 1a. "Caxton Atlas of the Universe," p. 204.] This situation is very uncommon as the reverse is usually true of all open or galactic clusters....The constellation of ORION is one of the most outstanding star groupings in the heavens....Despite its size of about 350 light years diameter and despite the vast quantities of gas and dust it contains, the whole system is gravitationally unstable and is steadily expanding outwards [i.e. 2. "The Oscillating Universe," by Prof. E. Opik, pp. 96-101.]....The gravitational 'bands' holding the constellation together have indeed been loosed, just as God said to Job.

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Not only that, but even the smaller clusters of stars within the association are fragmenting....'Can you bind the sweet cluster of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?' Our answer, of course, is the same that Job had to give in all humility - 'No Lord, such things are beyond men.' But the same humbling question is also a wonderful display of the inspired accuracy of the Word of God. All the more so when we realize that it was given thousands of years before the law of gravity was discovered or the telescope invented." (</span><a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.AnswersInGenesis.org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.AnswersInGenesis.org</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">, Barry Setterfield)</span>

************************************************************************

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CHARLES DARWIN (THE PROMOTER OF THE EVOLUTION LIE)

************************************************************************

Charles Darwin: "Man is descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears...." ("Descent of Man")

Darwin, as a young man, was a believer in the Bible:

Charles Darwin: "I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible." ("Life and Letters," Vol. I, p. 39)

As an elderly man (the theory of evolution having destroyed his faith in God), Darwin rejected the inspiration of the Holy Bible:

Charles Darwin: "For myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation [from a God]..." ("Life and Letters," Vol. I, p. 277)

Thomas Carlyle (the famous historian and essayist) wrote:

"I have known three generations of the Darwins - grandfather, father and son - atheists all....I saw [Darwin] not many months ago; told him I had read his Origin of Species and other books: [and] that he had by no means satisfied me that we were descended from monkeys, but [that he] had gone far to persuade me that he and his so-called scientific brethren had brought the present generation very near to monkeys...A good sort of man is this Darwin, and well meaning, but with a very little intellect."

In regard to how life originally began, Darwin confessed:

Charles Darwin: "I am in a hopeless muddle."

Darwin could never fully trust his own logic since his theory that man's mind had developed from monkeys caused him to doubt his own reasoning powers!:

Charles Darwin: "Can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animals, be trusted...? (Biography, 1876; quoted by his son)

Darwin finally confessed that evolution had no true scientific basis:

Charles Darwin: "There are two or three million of species on earth, sufficient field, one might think for observation. But it must be said today that in spite of all the efforts of trained observers, NOT ONE CHANGE OF A SPECIES INTO ANOTHER is on record."
("Life and Letters," Vol. III. p. 25)

Although there is no clear evidence that Darwin ever repudiated his fabled theory, the following words were recorded by Lady Hope at Darwin death bed:

Charles Darwin: "I was a young man with uninformed ideas. I threw out queries, suggestions...and to my astonishment the ideas took like wildfire. People made a religion of them...."

It is clear that the Devil played upon the desire of mankind to escape responsibility before God. Hitler later used Darwin's ideas to justify the killing of "the weak" (and those he decided were weak). The Bible predicted that this rebellion would occur:

2 Thessalonians 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day [the coming of Jesus to judge the world] shall not come, except there come a FALLING AWAY FIRST, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the LAST DAYS scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

1 Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the LATTER TIMES some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy...

Will you not repent of this evolution lie, and receive Jesus Christ as your Saviour today - before it is too late?:

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

**********************************

THE BATTLE OF MONTGOMERY

**********************************

Our prayers are with the many saints gathered together today to support Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore (a Southern Baptist). The core of the issue concerns the rapid deterioration of state rights:

"Attorney General Bill Pryor said Thursday he would refuse to help Moore violate the court order, which could result in contempt fines of about $5,000 a day against the state....Supporters cheered Moore's claim that a federal court doesn't have the legal authority to make a state judge remove the monument....Pryor said he personally believes the Old Testament laws can be displayed LEGALLY but that doesn't change his responsibility as attorney general. 'I have a duty to obey all orders of courts even when I disagree with those orders,' Pryor said in a statement."(Cnn.com, August 15, 2003)

Does not Pryor (a Roman Catholic) basically admit that it is ILLEGAL, constitutionally, for the federal court to enforce such an action against a state? How far, then, would he be willing to go with his idea that it is his responsibility to obey all court orders, regardless of their legality?

Does he also view his allegiance to the Pope in the same light? It would have been impossible for Nazism to commit one crime without the thousands of people who supported it, "out of duty," against their own consciences.

It is insane to try to hide the history of the founding of America upon Christian and Biblical principles. But the underlying issue to debate is not whether we agree that the Ten Commandments should be displayed, but whether or not it is constitutionally (and therefore legally, and
honestly,) proper for the federal government to enter into the controversy at all.

While we must guard against a Catholic (or Protestant) Church-State "theocracy" which punishes people for the "first table," we must also realize that all true laws have a moral basis, and that America is a country founded upon CHRISTIAN morality (not Hindu or Muslim). This balance made America great. It allows freedom of conscience in religion, while recognizing Biblical principles as a foundation for ethics:

"It is abundantly manifest that, when Roger Williams declared to the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay that the civil magistrate had no right to punish men for the violation of the first table - that is, the first four commandments of the Decalogue - he advanced a principle which had been held more than a hundred years earlier by Hubmaier and had been urged by his own countrymen when Williams was a mere youth." (Benjamin O. True, "Baptists and Religious Liberty")

The following is an excellent poem written by Justice Roy Moore:

"America the Beautiful or so you used to be Land of the Pilgrims pride, I'm glad they'll never see.

Babies piled in dumpsters, Abortion on demand, Oh, sweet land of liberty, your house is on the sand.

Our children wander aimlessly poisoned by cocaine, Choosing to indulge their lusts, when God has said abstain.

From sea to shining sea our Nation turns away From the teaching of God's love and a need always to pray.

So many worldly pastors tell lies about our Rock, Saying God is going broke so they can fleece the flock.

We've kept God in our temples, how callous we have grown, When earth is but His footstool and Heaven is His throne.

We've voted in a government that's rotting at the core, Appointing Godless judges who throw reason out the door, Too soft to place a killer in a well-deserved tomb, But brave enough to kill a baby before he leaves the womb.

You think that God's not angry that our land's a moral slum?

How much longer will He wait before His judgment comes?

How are we to face our God from whom we cannot hide?

What then is left for us to do, but stem the evil tide?

If we who are His children will humbly turn and pray Seek His holy face and mend our evil way, Then God will hear from Heaven and forgive us of our sins, He'll heal our sickly land and those who live within.

But America the Beautiful if you don't, then you will see, A sad but Holy God withdraw His hand from thee. "

California Pastor, Wiley Drake, writes:

<span style="font-size: x-small;">"While serving my Country in the late 60's I became a Christian, while on board the aircraft carrier, U.S.S. Kitty Hawk. After I became a Christian, I was invited to a CHAPEL service on the hanger deck, where the Chaplain led us to pray for wisdom, and Godâ€™s protection, before our ship entered the battle zone, in Viet Nam. Judge Roy Moore in Montgomery Alabama has been in battle for several years in an attempt to protect the ability of a U.S. citizen to acknowledge Almighty God in a public place. In his duty as the Chief Justice of the State of Alabama he installed a monument to the 10 Commandments, in the Alabama State Supreme Court building. For several years he has battled, and lost, to maintain this freedom. We are praying that the Supreme Court of the U.S. will hear this case.

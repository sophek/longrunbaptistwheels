STAGE-SETTING FOR THE MARK OF THE BEAST  (NEWS REPORT)
***************************************************************
"Paying for drinks with wave of the hand - Club-goers in Spain get
implanted chips for ID, payment purposes (April 14, 2004, WND, Sherrie
Gossett)...Being recognized has never been easier for VIP patrons of the
Baja Beach Club in Barcelona, Spain. Like a scene out of a science-fiction
movie, all it takes is a syringe-injected microchip implant for the
beautiful men and women of the nightclub scene to breeze past a 'reader'
that recognizes their identity, credit balance and even automatically
opens doors to exclusive areas of the club for them. They can buy drinks
and food with a wave of their hand and don't need to worry about losing a
credit card or wallet. 'By simply passing by our reader, the Baja Beach
Club will know who you are and what your credit balance is,' Conrad K.
Chase explains. Chase is director of the Baja Beach Club in Barcelona.
'From the moment of their implantation they will also have free entry and
access to the VIP area,' he said....'The objective of this technology is
to bring an ID system to a global level that will destroy the need to
carry ID documents and credit cards,' Chase said."

THE PRAYER POWER OF THE SEPARATED LIFE (Sermon, Pastor Joey Faust)
************************************************************************

Note: Pride and self-righteousness are certainly great sins that will
hinder our prayers (Luke 18:14). However, many today appear to have the
idea that being "loose" in obedience is the safest way to guard against
such sins of the Pharisee. They forget that the Publican's prayer was
heard (before the Pharisee's prayer) because he was confessing and
forsaking his sins! We should not despise others, or judge motives, in
self-righteousness. But we must soberly reflect upon the fact that
multitudes of professing, Christian people have been preaching loose
living (to piously guard against legalism) for many decades now. And all
we see in the mainstream is a "revival" of Roman Catholicism and
pop-psychology marketing promotions disguised as devotional books! What
has happened? I say that we have no great move of God's Spirit because
many Christians have stopped praying FERVENTLY, CONSISTENTLY, with HOLY
hands:

1 Timothy 2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up HOLY
hands, without wrath and doubting.

To be "HOLY" today is to risk being despised or ridiculed as a "Pharisee."
This is a great trick of the Serpent. The Devil has robbed multitudes of
believers of power in prayer. For this reason, let us go back in time, not
many decades ago, and let us hear from a man of God who beheld and
experienced a great work of God's Spirit. Let us hear what he had to say
about REVIVAL. His words agree with Scripture. The following words of
Oswald J. Smith, quoted in my sermon notes below, are ABSOLUTELY in
contradiction to what most modern preachers, speakers, writers, and
commentators are teaching the churches. Let us put aside these modern
words of religious apostasy that attempt to hide under the cloak of an
abused (if not fabled) "Pauline pragmatism." Let us return to the old ways
of MUCH PRAYING, lifting up the HOLY hands of a separated life to God. It
brought forth fruit in the Bible. It has brought forth fruit in history.
And even though we are living in the latter times, it can still bring
forth much fruit today! Let us have faith enough to separate and persevere
in prayer!

THE PRAYER POWER OF THE SEPARATED LIFE
 
TEXT: Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men
OUGHT ALWAYS to pray, and not to faint;

I intend to preach on how SIN affects prayer. Let me give you a few
verses, and then we will look at others:

Psalms 66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
tongue.
18 If I REGARD INIQUITY IN MY HEART, the Lord will NOT hear me:

Proverbs 15:8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD:
but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
29 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of THE
RIGHTEOUS.

Proverbs 28:9 He that turneth away his ear from HEARING THE LAW, even his
prayer shall be abomination.

John 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

We should not be discouraged from prayer by the false idea that we must
meet an impossible standard. Let us go to God and confess our sins. If we
cover them, we will not prosper. But we must not forget the reality that
we DO HAVE POWER TO LIVE AT A HIGHER OR LOWER LEVEL of holiness in Christ.
And there will be a daily choice: Will we enjoy having power with God in
prayer, or will we enjoy a certain sin (for a season)? It is FAR BETTER to
have power with God! But oftentimes Christians say:
"I will be happier with my sin than by having God hear my prayers." This
is not only hurtful toward ourselves, it is very selfish! We have the
privilege and duty to intercede for people with God! And the amount of sin
we have will greatly determine whether or not we prevail with God, or to
what degree.

We can now understand when the Bible warns:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.
2 For men shall be LOVERS OF THEIR OWN SELVES...

People are running blindly to destruction and ruin, in this life, and the
next. The plea goes out for someone to stand in the gap and intercede with
God. But no one is found! Why? Because they ask: "Uh, how much TIME is it
going to take? I'm on my way to a restaurant." And for those who will take
the time, there is still one last hurdle: "Well, I tried it, and it didn't
work. So I am giving up on praying for people." Why don't you try to clean
up your life in some areas, and then pray again...? "Hmm...I pretty much
like everything the way it is. And if I have to change some things to get
more power in prayer, I think I'll just forget the prayer thing."

In other words, just as the Bible predicts, people are TOO SELFISH! They
are too in love with sinful pleasures to give them up to have power with
God for others!:

Ezekiel 22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
hedge, and STAND IN THE GAP before me for the land, that I should not
destroy it: but I FOUND NONE.
31 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed
them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon
their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

Isaiah 59:16 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
no intercessor...

In the last days, there will be few like selfless Moses, who was willing
to stand in the gap for others:

Exodus 32:10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath
wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land
of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?

Psalms 106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
should destroy them.

There is not a single Christian that does not have this potential power
with God, IF, he or she is only willing to:

1. Be unselfish and loving enough to take the time to pray fervently. (We
have not because we ask not).

2. Be unselfish enough to forsake certain sins that our prayers may avail
much with God.

It's as if God has given to you a talent. And He says, "Hold it up to me,
and I will have mercy on these people, and turn them from sin and
destruction."

"God, I am holding it up, but it is not working. They are dying, God."

"Yes. You have idols. Take the talent and quickly crush your idols. The
people are perishing. Love them enough to crush your idols, and then hold
it up to me again."

...But the man walks away in sorrow. He buries his talent, AND KEEPS HIS
IDOLS!

This is what is happening. It is through preaching AND PRAYER that God
saves many, or keeps them from sin and destruction:

1 Timothy 2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
truth.
 
So we have not because we ask not. Many people are too selfish to even
take the time to ask God for souls and for wandering Christians to be
restored.

And even in regard to those who will pray, we must remember that FORSAKING
SIN AND WORLDLINESS gives our prayers POWER WITH GOD. But Christians are
growing increasingly selfish; they will not give up worldliness to have
power in their prayers for others. But it is a fact that God wants us to
pray always, and to pray fervently for others without ceasing, that they
may be saved and blessed. And then, when it is not working, we should not
to give up; we should search our ways, and examine ourselves, and cleanse
our hands, and purify our hearts - and then try again, over and over:

1 John 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments, and do those things that are PLEASING in his sight.

Can you say that such and such a thing is PLEASING in God's sight? Instead
of asking whether or not God will kill you for something, it is far better
to ask, "Is this thing PLEASING to God?" Is it PRAISEWORTHY? If we please
God, we can have faith that our prayers will be heard, and we will be of
great benefit to others!

Another great record of selfless intercession (as a picture of our Lord
Jesus Christ) is the story of Abraham and Lot. It is clear that Lot was
rescued out of Sodom, due largely to the importunate prayers of Abraham:

Genesis 18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I
will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not
destroy it for ten's sake.

Genesis 19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
plain, that GOD REMEMBERED ABRAHAM, and sent Lot out of the midst of the
overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

Abraham not only took the time, he was also willing to keep knocking! But
let us not forget one more important thing: Abraham had power with God TO
WIN THESE SOULS because HE WAS SEPARATED! He was not IN Sodom. This is a
picture of Christian keeping himself unspotted from the world. Lot chose
the land "close" to Sodom! And he soon learned that if you make provision
FOR the flesh, you will soon be IN the flesh! But Abraham kept to the
PILGRIM walk. Lot (or at least his friends) probably thought that Abraham
was an old fool: "You don't have to life like this, man. You are way too
uptight out in the wilderness. God doesn't expect you to live like this.
You have to MEDDLE with them who are given to change. Go mingle among
them. When they see that you are like them, you can win them."

Well, it's a good-sounding theory. It certainly SEEMS like this would be
the best plan. Let's see if it worked:

Genesis 19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the
LORD will destroy this city. BUT HE SEEMED AS ONE THAT MOCKED UNTO HIS
SONS IN LAW.

He couldn't even influence his relatives! And he couldn't pray them out.
And Lot lost most of his family. His daughters married Sodomites. The two
that came out were morally confused. He lost his wife. But Abraham's
family was safe.

So Abraham prevailed with God. He proves to us that we can win souls. He
won some out of Sodom itself! If we are NOT winning souls and seeing
revival among us, it may be because we are too lazy and selfish to pray
hard, and then go soul winning. Or it may mean that we have idols and sin
in the camp:

Joshua 7:8 O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
before their enemies!
10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus
upon thy face?
11 Israel hath sinned...they have even taken of the accursed thing...
12 ...NEITHER WILL I BE WITH YOU ANY MORE, except ye destroy the accursed
from among you.
13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, SANCTIFY YOURSELVES...

Something is wrong today. Most everyone can see it. It's as if much of
Christianity is having to sell out to even look like it has some life.
Everyone is buying the idea that we must get worldly to win souls. But
soul winning is a spiritual work. It takes God's power.

Would it not be wise to go back to people who actually had great revivals
and hear from them, testing their words from the Scriptures? We hear what
people are telling us today, and it seems like wisdom. But it is not
working. The soul-winning and life changing power of God's Spirit is not
with many of our churches any more. There is a lot of Laodicean machinery
and glamour. But we must confess that God must be warning us:  "Up,
sanctify the people, and say, SANCTIFY YOURSELVES..." There is PORNOGRAPHY
in our churches, in the homes of Christians. There are many things that
the world doe snot view as wrong. But these things grieve God's Spirit.
Let us hear the words of Oswald J. Smith (who spread revival far and wide)
years ago, and APPLY THEM today. Let us get on God's side, and quit
hindering those who are trying to call the people to sanctification, so we
can have Spiritual power in our prayers:

"It is doubtful if there ever was a time when the note of separation
needed to be sounded more than today. The world has become so churchy, and
the church so worldly that it is hard to distinguish the one from the
other. The line of demarcation has been so completely broken down that
churches, where revivals once flourished, whose spiritual life was at one
time deep and strong, are today mere social centers, over which God has
long ago written the word 'Ichabod.' 'The glory has departed.' But
worldliness in the professing church is only another sign of the end of
the age. The prophetic utterances of God's Word are being literally
fulfilled. It cannot be long now before He comes. People seem to have the
idea that we must mingle with the world and become like it in order to win
souls and influence lives for God. Yet, when a man falls into a deep well
no one ever dreams of jumping down alongside of him in order to get him
out. Instead he stays away up at the top and from there let's down a
ladder or rope and then lifts him up. Ah, no! The men who have won souls
and influenced other loves for God have been the men who have walked with
God far above the masses, and from this altitude of spirituality have
drawn others up to their level. The only way to win others is to be
different ourselves, and thus attract by something they lack, and BY
PREVAILING WITH GOD, prevail with men. Had Abraham gone to live with Lot
in Sodom his influence would have availed but little. IT WAS WHEN HE
SEPARATED HIMSELF AND STOOD FAR AFAR OFF ON THE HIGHLANDS OF FAITH WITH
GOD THAT HIS INTERCESSIONS SECURED LOT'S DELIVERANCE. Let us separate. We
must dwell apart with God. Then I want to say that the world expects the
Christian to be different. It has its own standard of what a saint should
be. AND EVEN WHEN IT SUCCEEDS IN DRAWING US DOWN TO ITS LEVEL, IT BUT
MOCKS AND LAUGHS at our plight. No longer does it respect us nor reverence
our position. We are no better than others. If WE DRESS AND ACT LIKE THE
WORLD, how can anyone tell whether we are Christians or not? There must be
a difference. Now, separation has always been God's standard. Abraham had
to leave his country, and his father's house....Yes, separation is still
the call of God. 'Come out...' The world must be forsaken and separation
maintained. Now the separated life means separation from worldly pleasure.
The dance, the theater, and the card party are not of God, but of the
world....The spirit of the world pervades such pleasures, and prayer and
testimony in the midst of these things is out of the question. The two
simply don't go together....But you say, 'How can I give up [worldly
companions]? Child of God, you will not have to give them up. You live a
separated life and they will soon give YOU up. Make friends of God's
children, and whether they be brown, or yellow, black or white, you will
find them more precious...and more binding than even that of blood
relatives out of Christ. They will understand when the members of your own
family do not."
(Oswald J. Smith, "The Separated Life," "The Man That God Uses," 1942)

2 Corinthians 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,

James 4:4....whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the
enemy of God.
5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye
may be healed. The effectual FERVENT PRAYER of a RIGHTEOUS man availeth
much.

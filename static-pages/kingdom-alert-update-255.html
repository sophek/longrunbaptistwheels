LAODICEAN DISINTEGRATION: THE PREPARATION FOR ROME'S BLOODY REVIVAL
(EXPOSING THE RADICAL ANTI-HEAD PASTOR MOVEMENT)
************************************************************************
These articles on church government have been organized online
(http://www.kingdombaptist.org) under the heading: Church
Government/Elders.

If you are not a part of the RADICAL anti-head-pastor movement, then this
article is not written directly to you. I am writing against those who
think it is their duty to "deliver" people out of Baptist churches, simply
because such a church has a head-pastor.

In future articles in this series, I intend to provide more evidence that
the "angels" in the seven churches of Revelation are head-pastors. We will
examine the history of the Jewish synagogue, and notice how the word
"angel" (i.e. messenger) was already in use as a title for God's earthly
servants, both in the inspired Scriptures, and in Jewish history. We will
examine additional objections to the head-pastor model, and deal with them
one by one. In this article, I simply intend to alert readers to the
dangerous spirit that is brewing, that seeks to draw people out from their
churches. Many of these teachers relate having a head-pastor to manage the
affairs of a local church under Jesus (much like a quarterback, under a
coach), to the abuses of the Roman Catholic hierarchy! These teachers use
these later perversions of the Catholic Church to pry up TOO MUCH of the
foundation. The Devil always uses one extreme to scare some Christians
into an opposite one. He did the same thing with Purgatory. Many
Christians ran from this error, to such a degree, that they ended up with
a shallow Judgment Seat of Christ. And instead of realizing that the
earlier, so-called "church fathers" taught something entirely different
than later ones, they concluded that the whole foundation of chastisement
at the Judgment Seat must be in error. Mede has rightly observed that
"over-doing always undoes." This is true in regard to running from the
Judgment Seat, and it is true in regard to running from the doctrine of
head-pastors. We can become so gun-shy of Rome that we end up running from
one error right into a greater heresy of Rome (e.g. many run from the
heresy of "Purgatory" so fast and far that they are willing to teach the
pope's eternal salvation by grace AND fruitbearing!). Seventh Day
Adventists have long attempted to use history and the so-called "Catholic
Sunday" to draw people out of Baptist churches. In the same manner, many
of these people in the anti-head-pastor movement are using similar
tactics. I will show that many of the Plymouth Brethren (Darbyites) were
doing the same thing in the 19th century.

It is no longer prudent to remain passive concerning the claims that are
being made by some in this anti-head-pastor movement. Many of these
teachers are not passive. They are sowing discord and dividing many good
churches. They are on the offence, and the zeitgeist of the age is, sadly,
blowing in their direction. However, this movement will lead to
disintegration and chaos. The Devil is attacking the institution of the
family, and the institution of the local church:

Psalms 11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

By calling people out of churches with head-pastors, many are perhaps
unaware of how they are contributing to the rise of Rome (the very
heresies they claim to be avoiding). The last church that Jesus addresses
in Revelation 3 is in "Laodicea." This is a literal church in the first
century, but it is also prophetic of the "falling away" that will occur in
many churches at the end of this age. "Laodicea" means "laws or customs of
the laity." The Holy Scriptures and its commands are being replaced by
self-rule and worldly customs. And God's true ministers are being despised
and replaced by "puppets" that will entertain and tickle the people. Rome
smiles at the chaos and disintegration (Revelation 17). In government,
immoral anarchy leads to tyranny. In the same manner, as Laodiceanism
abounds, it will leave such wreckage in its midst, that many will gladly
embrace Romanism for "security" and "final authority" (Revelation 17).
This radical movement against head-pastors is simply one more component in
fulfilling the warnings in 2 Peter (and Jude) about these last days:

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
uncleanness, and DESPISE GOVERNMENT. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled,
they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
19 While they PROMISE THEM LIBERTY, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.

I must add a serious disclaimer. There have been many in history (as well
as today) who have (at least in profession) believed that having a
head-pastor is an error. For example, there have been many wonderful
Plymouth Brethren that have greatly blessed future generations with their
writings, and testimonies of their lives. I think of R.C. Chapman, George
Mueller, and G.H. Pember (to name a few). However, even in their days,
there were others who took a more militant view, and appeared to set up
their own views of church government as the most important thing in the
Bible. They were unbalanced. They became aggressive and divisive, and
began to entice others from Baptist churches, and the denominations. What
was then only a "seed" (perhaps a Devilish test-run!), has begun to
blossom today, in the Laodicean age. Often, good men cannot see the final
fruits of their own errors in the days in which they live. Therefore, on
one side, some of the older Brethren writers are some of my favorite to
read. And I am aware that there are multitudes of good men today that
believe in a plurality of pastors (no head-pastor), that do not seek to
become divisive, seditious, and "robbers of churches." They have the
maturity to agree to disagree, and they understand the danger of pulling
Christians out of strong, healthy churches over some minor doctrines. One
writer (who is writing against these anti-head-pastor advocates) observes:

"In truth, the difference between churches with elders and those with a
pastor-deacon-people type government is normally very small in actual
practice. Often the major differences lie in the definitions of words and
the divisions of duties." (1)

In other words, a large church that has a head pastor, with assistant
pastors and deacons, will often not look much different from a church with
a so-called plural eldership. Assistant pastors often preach. And there
are many times that head-pastors decide issues by taking a vote of chief
men, or even seeking unanimity among them. Therefore, it would be absurd
to use the head-pastor model to leave a church where there are years of
history and roots, only to attend (or start!) a church with plural elders,
that is run practically the same way as the previous church, except in
name. There are many that understand these things, and they hold to their
views of plural eldership in a balanced manner.

But there are others (and their numbers are increasing) that are on a
campaign to pull people out of Baptist churches, one by one. They seek to
first infiltrate, and then to indoctrinate. They have many similarities
with Seventh Day Adventists:

"Unfortunately there are some in elder rule churches that are turning the
issue into one of major proportions claiming that their churches are more
Biblical and spiritual than those with the pastor-deacon-people
polity....I have valued friends who practice elder rule polity. This is
not one of the Fundamentals of the Faith.  Unfortunately, some with that
polity are parading themselves as those that are the most Biblical and
that this matter is so important that they feel led to 'deliver' poor
souls bound in pastor-deacon-people type of churches. I believe that these
proponents of elder rule are misguided and often inconsistent for two
reasons. First, because they think that their polity is far more
scriptural and second, because they have overly emphasized the importance
of this matter....Could we not suspect another motive behind such an
intense promotion of polity differences? Could it possibly be the desire
to obtain people from other churches who are doing the work of evangelism,
follow-up and training without having to expend such effort? Only God
knows these things. But such inconsistencies have a foul odor....People
who get in the habit of migrating from church to church will never know
the joy of using their spiritual gifts to bear long term fruit in the
Lord's work." (2)

If this reproof against some of these anti-head-pastor advocates sounds
severe, one must remember the damage that can be caused by enticing people
out of strong churches, for minor or doubtful disputations. There are
certainly legitimate, doctrinal reasons to leave churches. But the Devil
is more than happy to use ANY minor issue to plant or stir up a murmuring,
disgruntled, discontented spirit in a church member, and provoke him or
her to leave the hedge of protection (the local church):

1 Timothy 3:15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou
oughtest to behave thyself IN the house of God, which is THE CHURCH of the
living God, the PILLAR and ground of the truth.

The institution of the local church (a pillar, itself founded on the Rock
of Jesus), is one of the foundations that is being destroyed. Once a
person is disconnected from the church, the goal will then often be to get
her into a new "fellowship" with another center of control. Not only does
this assume that the new "fellowship" will be as adequate a spiritual
covering as the former church, but it also assumes that the newly
disgruntled person WILL make the transition, and will not backslide and
end up entirely shipwrecked. It is therefore crucial that pastors lay
again the Biblical supports for a head-pastor, and reprove this teaching
that seeks to draw Christians out of Baptist churches. It is one thing to
stand against the modern, super movie-churches with disco dancers (and
everything else that comes along with them). It is another thing to teach
that the entire concept of so-called modern church is Roman Catholic and
Satanic, and leave young Christians scorning everything that has to do
with it. It is not necessarily the government of the church that is wrong.
Various doctrinal weaknesses and strengths are found within every type of
government.

The truth is, this spirit (i.e. decrying the head-pastor concept to draw
people out of churches) is nothing new. It was sharply exposed and rebuked
by an earlier generation of Christians. Spurgeon was one of the most
outspoken critics of the anti-head-pastor advocates. However, this was
mainly a defense against their attacks. Some would stand in front of his
church, and hand out tracts, and seek to draw people out of his church. It
is no wonder that he responded sharply against this branch of the Plymouth
Brethren movement. Many were attacking him! (People often think that
head-pastors should be so nice that they allow people to be misguided and
scattered). After some tracts were circulated by Brethren calling Spurgeon
a blasphemer, Spurgeon wrote:

"We have been requested to reply to a small tract which has been given
away at the door of the Tabernacle, by one of the 'Plymouth Brethren,' but
it is so devoid of all sense, Scripture and reason, that it needs no
reply....Our name and character are in too good a keeping to be injured by
these dastardly anonymous attacks. Neither Mr. Newton nor Mr. [George]
Muller would sanction such action..." (3)

Spurgeon had warm fellowship with B.W. Newton (an early Brethren founder)
and George Muller (who would sometimes speak at his church). But he had
little patience with radical Darbyites. (Newton himself first divided with
Darby when Newton no longer embraced Darby's radical
anti-head-pastor-isms; Muller would also later divide with Darby over
issues of church discipline).

Spurgeon was passively premillennial, and he respected
premillennial-futurists like Robert Govett (not a Brethren writer), and
G.H. Pember. However, perhaps this is one reason that he did not give the
Second Coming, and other aspects of Bible prophecy, the Biblical emphasis
they deserved. An emphasis on Bible prophecy was perhaps wrongly
associated with these Plymouth Brethren. Notice the following words of
Spurgeon against the anti-head-pastor advocates in his day:

"The outcry against the 'one man ministry' cometh not of God, but of proud
self-conceit, of men who are not content to learn although they have no
power to teach." (4)

"Do not be startled at the sound which seems to have such terrors for
certain brethren. I have heard the cant of those who object to a 'one-man
ministry,' a ministry to which all the while they usually submit in their
own meetings..." (5)

"The 'one-man ministry,' as certain wise men call it, has been far more
used of the LORD than trained bands with their officers." (6)

"Every now and then we hear some simpleton or other talking against a
'one-man ministry,' when it has been a one-man ministry from the
commencement of the world to the present day; and whenever you try to have
any other form of ministry, and doing it thoroughly and heartily and
independently and bravely in the sight of God, you very soon run upon
quicksands." (7)

And perhaps Spurgeon's most thorough and firm rebuke of this movement is
found in an article in his magazine, "The Sword and Trowel." It was a
review of a book by Grant, who had also written against the Plymouth
Brethren:

"As on all hands, with a diligence never exceeded, and a subtlety never
equaled, they [the Plymouth Brethren] are laboring to seduce the members
of our churches to the subversion of the truth and the overthrow of the
needful order and discipline of our Zion, it may be well to disseminate
information concerning their sentiments and tactics. There is nothing
which they have so much to dread as being thoroughly unearthed and
exposed; for their grosser errors are not generally made known to their
dupes until they are fairly in their meshes....whose secret but rapid
growth is among the darkest signs of the times....women are almost
invariably the parties whom they seek to 'convert.' They are wise enough
in their generation to know that if a man's wife is got over, she will
give her husband no rest until she has made a resolute effort to prevail
on him to join the 'gathering' along with her....It is as true of them as
a body as it was of those women to whom Paul in his Second Epistle to
Timothy alludes when he represents them as creeping into houses. Their
favorite plan is to single out the best members of other evangelical
churches, and endeavor to get them over; and when they have succeeded in
inoculating them with Brethrenism, they are advised not at once to leave
the church of which they are members, but to remain for a time, in the
hope of being able to convince others of the error of their way in
'sitting under such teachers.'....The new 'sister' commences with certain
stereotyped phrases in endeavoring to bring over the party aimed at, by
remarking that the pastor of the particular congregation is a good man - a
very excellent man according to the amount of his knowledge of the truth -
but that he is not sufficiently taught of the Spirit on certain important
points of doctrine....'Oh, yes, my dear sister;' 'oh, no, my dearest
sister,' were phrases spoken in the most tender tones, and were among the
weapons which were liberally employed with the view of ensuring another
recruit....It matters not to them that, by going into churches or chapels
in this way, in parts of the country where the minister, owing to the
smallness of the number of his congregation, has the greatest difficulty
imaginable to continue to maintain the Christian ministry...The minister,
with his wife and family, may he thrown destitute on the world. The
minister's heart, indeed, may be literally broken - still that will not
cause them to experience a momentary pang. No amount, indeed, of misery
they may have brought on God's faithful ministering servant will give them
even a moment's uneasiness. On the contrary, they will rejoice at the ruin
they have wrought in breaking up a church, because believing they are
thereby doing God service....others have been made miserable for life by
the dissensions which these 'troublers in Israel' have occasioned in their
churches....A Congregational minister in the country, writes to me on this
matter as follows: - 'What the Plymouth Brethren have done in country
towns no one but those who are intimate with the life of country churches
can tell. There is no Congregational minister, either Baptist or
Independent, who is not ready to denounce them as the greatest troublers
of the peace of Israel since the days of Ahab. Much in these days is said
about the Jesuits, but the Plymouth Brethren will compare with them, both
in respect to stealthy slyness and persistent effort to make converts.
There are always in every church a few disaffected spirits, who only need
the voice of the tempter to make them cantankerous. These are so much
tinder to the spark of the Plymouth Brethren's tongue of fire...'let us
get away from all this, and have no church, but just read the Bible for
ourselves.' A division ensues, and soon, instead of reading the Bible for
themselves, one man gets the whole thing into his own hands, and another
church is formed, virtually where there was to be NO church and NO
minister....With this feeling is naturally associated an amount of
arrogance in the assertion of their own views, which those who differ from
them often find to be unbearable...." (8)

George N. H. Peters, around 1883, gives a similar testimony and rebuke
against the Plymouth Brethren. Peters wrote the mammoth (three-volume)
work, "The Theocratic Kingdom" which is one of the greatest defenses of
premillennialism ever penned. Peters teaches a pre-trib rapture (of
watching saints), and mainly exposes the errors of amillennialism and
postmillennialism. In our day, such views have been ignorantly, with one
blanket, labeled "Darbyism." Yet, such views were taught in "The Rainbow,"
by Robert Govett and other writers, by J.A. Seiss, J.R. Graves, and many
other dispensationalists, without any hint that they originated with
Plymouth Brethren. I mention these facts in order to show that these
rebukes of the Plymouth Brethren were not due to some prejudices against
premillennialism, literal interpretation, or prophetic studies. George
N.H. Peters was at the forefront of such studies. Yet, Peters writes:

"...we are compelled to dissent from the exceeding lax views of the
'Plymouth Brethren' respecting church government....We cannot, therefore,
sympathize with the 'Brethren's' tirade against 'Clericism,' simply
because, if followed, it would result in DISINTEGRATION and
perversion....The result is, that however honest in their views, they are
only injuring the truth by associating such demoralizing opinions,
unnecessarily disquieting others in the church relationships, and
increasing the number of sects by forming, with special and extraordinary
high spiritual claims, another....[Brethrenism] raises up an antagonism to
other churches, which, to say the least, is uncharitable, and
unchristian....It will be well for these 'Brethren' if they have the
piety, usefulness, etc. that many in these churches manifest. This intense
bigotry (and there are others who just as freely condemn the 'Brethren')
is the natural, logical outgrowth of their system, and evidences that it
is based on error." (9)

Again, in another place, he writes:

"The principles [of the Plymouth Brethren] are disintegrating, and have a
tendency to alienate..."

These reproofs of the Plymouth Brethren reveal that Peters was not in any
way concerned that he was overthrowing the foundations for
premillennialism or the pre-tribulational rapture by rebuking Darbyites.
This is because the teachings of premillennialism, futurism, literal
interpretation, literal Israel, the secret coming, the rapture, etc. did
not arise, nor were they dependent upon, Darbyites. It is true that Darby
emphasized the differences between Israel and the Church to a greater
degree than most other premillennialists (who were known as
dispensationalists). But to many, this was not a plus. It was seen as
another unbalanced extreme that would produce lawlessness by cutting up
the New Testament too rigidly (leading to the excesses of
hyper-dispensationalism). Many Darbyites were known for teaching that sins
should not be confessed by believers, and that there is no need to ask God
for forgiveness. This type of excessive division between the disciples of
Christ in the Gospels, and those in the Epistles, often caused many
prophetic truths to be thrown out with the bathwater by those teachers who
rightly fled such errors.

The discordant church-wreckers rebuked by Spurgeon and Peters would be the
first to deny that they despised authority (2 Peter 2:10). But it must be
remembered that Jude predicted that many in the last days they will walk
in the "gainsaying of Core" (Jude 1:11). And Korah did not BLATANTLY
despise government! He only claimed that Moses was wrong for exercising
TOO MUCH authority (i.e. Darby's rebuke of Newton):

Numbers 16:3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing ALL
THE CONGREGATION are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them:
wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?

The Levites were called to be "assistants" to the house of Aaron. This was
a blessed place of service, but the Levites (led by Korah) wanted the
priesthood to be shared by all the Levites.

Those who decry the head-pastor system would, of course, argue that
head-pastors are not in the place of Moses today. We are all priests.
However, Jude (a New Testament epistle) teaches that the same sin will be
committed by many in the last days. Certainly, then, there are many
applications of this sin in this modern age. And I believe that those who
bitterly deny one head-manager in the home (under Jesus), and those who
bitterly deny one head-manager in the church (under Jesus), are examples
of the sin of Korah in these last days. The language and spirit of many in
this anti-head-pastor movement sounds frighteningly like the language used
by Korah. For example, Frank Viola writes:

"There is not a single verse in the entire NT that supports the existence
of the modern day Pastor! He simply did not exist in the early
church....Never in the imagination of a hallucinating man would any
first-century Christian conceive of the modern pastoral office!....The
unscriptural clergy/laity distinction has done untold harm to the Body of
Christ. It has ruptured the believing community into first and
second-class Christians. The clergy/laity dichotomy perpetuates an awful
falsehood. Namely, that some Christians are more privileged than others to
serve the Lord....The one-man ministry is entirely foreign to the NT, yet
we embrace it while it suffocates our functioning. We are living stones,
not dead ones. However, the pastoral office has transformed us into stones
that do not breathe....Permit me to get personal. The pastoral office has
stolen your right to function as a member of Christâ€™s Body! It has shut
your mouth and strapped you to a pew. It has distorted the reality of the
Body, making the Pastor a giant mouth and transforming you into a tiny
ear." (10)

If these brethren were only writing against the perverted abuses of the
unbiblical, Roman Catholic clergy, all would be well. But they are
including in these Romish errors ALL CHURCHES that have a head-pastor
(regardless of how the church operates). This movement will spread like
Preterism. It is a movement whose time has come. While it is true that
some churches need to wake up and liven up; and they may need to allow
more opportunities for testifying and contributing, there is also much
poison in this teaching. Under it, many will be robbed of opportunities
for abundant fruitbearing in pastor-led churches. Many will abandon strong
churches to sit at home on the Lord's Day (or go to secular work). They
will scorn the so-called "churches." Their only "ministry" will be to
deliver some other poor soul out of the Baptist church, into the same
alienated bitterness they have fallen into:

Jude 1:16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in
admiration because of advantage.
19 These be they who SEPARATE themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.

There is, therefore, no greater time for pastors to obey the command to
Timothy:

2 Timothy 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
after their own lusts shall they HEAP to themselves teachers, having
itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto FABLES.

One "fable" is this idea that every church is allegedly infected with
Roman Catholicism if it has a head-pastor (regardless of whether or not he
lords over the flock).  The "bait" on their hook is the claim that the
idea of a head-pastor originated in Romanism, or a post-apostolic
departure from Biblical order. Whenever it is documented before them that
the head-pastor model is seen in early Christian writings, long before
Constantine, or diocesan bishops arose, it is sometimes claimed that this
is because these earliest writings have been tampered with, and they are
not to be trusted. Seventh Day Adventists have used a similar argument to
teach that the first day of the week is not the Lord's Day. They say the
first day was designated as the Lord's Day by the Roman Catholic Church.
Yet, when it is shown that Christians were meeting on the first day of the
week in the earliest ages after the Apostles, and that they referred to
the first day as the Lord's Day, we are then told by Adventists that these
early writings have been perverted by Rome! Therefore, they are free to
make an appeal to history to prove their case, but any historical facts
that are against them are considered "corrupted."

Is it true that the practice of having a head-pastor originated in a
departure from Biblical truth? Before we look at the inspired Scriptures,
I would like to once again remind the reader of the historic facts. G.H.
Lang (a writer I often quote and admire on many other subjects) was a
Plymouth Brethren writer. Therefore, he argues that any other form of
church government than that of the Open Brethren, is in error, and
originates in the apostasy of Catholicism (or its early seed). Lang
writes:

"...as sub-apostolic literature shows, new principles of church order were
instilled and adopted....Ignatius of Antioch, WHO FIRST EXALTED
EPISCOPACY, thus starting the Church on a fatal decline, right willingly
gave his body to the beasts of the amphitheatre....IT WAS NOT LESS THAN
TWENTY YEARS ONLY FROM THE DEATH OF THE LAST APOSTLE [John] that the
devoted Ignatius had thus departed from apostolic church order!" (11)

Here, Lang rejects the notion that the writings of Ignatius on church
government are corrupted. It is obvious that if Rome had perverted these
writings, they would have inserted their own views concerning bishops,
etc. But in Ignatius, a bishop has authority only over a LOCAL church. And
while Ignatius appears to teach that bishops and elders are of a different
order, there is no evidence that he denies that the head bishop of the
local church is also an elder (and vice versa). On this, Chrysostom
writes:

"'To the fellow-Bishops and Deacons.' What is this? were there several
Bishops of one city? Certainly not; but he called the Presbyters so. For
then they still interchanged the titles....So then, as I said, both the
Presbyters were of old called Bishops and Deacons of Christ, and the
Bishops Presbyters; and hence even now many Bishops write, 'To my
fellow-Presbyter,' and, 'To my fellow-Deacon.' But otherwise the specific
name is distinctly appropriated to each, the Bishop and the Presbyter...."
(12)

This is an important point. I know of many churches today with a
head-pastor, multiple assistant pastors, and deacons. It would be
perfectly normal to address a letter: "To the Pastors and Deacons of
______ church." No one would think by such a letter that I had denied that
such a church had a head-pastor. He would simply be addressed along with
the other assistant pastors.

But what are we to make of Lang's assertion that so quickly (barely twenty
years), Ignatius had already introduced so great an error concerning
church government? Anyone who reads the various epistles of Ignatius
should be able, at once, to see the error of such a view. One would have
to conclude that Ignatius was not only in error, BUT THAT HE WAS INSANE!
His views on church government are derived from personal letters to real
people in history. If there were no head-bishops of these churches, then
those who received the epistles must have thought the man had lost his
mind! And Ignatius does not write from the standpoint that these churches
have suddenly changed in their government. Therefore, one is forced to
conclude (if he will deny a head-pastor), that the churches that the Lord
Jesus addresses in the Book of Revelation (for Ignatius writes to these
same churches) were, at the time Jesus addressed them, ALREADY IN ERROR,
since they possessed head-pastors (called bishops by Ignatius). Why then
would the Lord appear to encourage such an error by addressing His letters
to a single "angel" (messenger) of each church? Three of the seven
churches are addressed by Ignatius. Why doesn't the Lord rebuke these same
churches for having head-pastors? No, the anti-head pastor advocates have
a serious roadblock in the way of their views in these earliest,
extra-biblical Christian writings. They are representative of the entire
practices of many well-known churches at the time of John the Apostle's
death. I CERTAINLY do not deny that Rome later perverted church
government. And perhaps some careless language by Ignatius helped to plant
the seeds for Rome's later perversions. But we must remember that
Nicolaitan popery is only one side of the error concerning church
government. There is an equal error on the other side, which is
Laodiceanism. And while Ignatius (who did not write under inspiration) was
perhaps guarding against the sins of Laodiceanism (i.e. the rebellion of
Korah), the Devil was launching a counter-attack on the other side, in
preparation for Romanism. Therefore, the lesson of this history would be
to watch for dangers on BOTH sides. Church leaders must sanctify the Lord
before their congregations (Numbers 27:14), and churches must respect the
offices God has ordained.

Ignatius DIED between 98 and 117 A.D. He writes:

"Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on
account of his youth..." (13)

These writings do not reveal any sign that Ignatius was teaching something
controversial concerning churches having a head bishop. He was not
creating a new office. He was writing to multiple churches which ALL had
the same set up: a head bishop, other assistant elders, and deacons. He
was writing at practically the same period that the Lord addressed seven
letters to the ANGELS of the churches in Asia Minor. Ignatius addresses
the head-pastors by name:

"I know that you possess an unblameless and sincere mind in patience, and
that not only in present practice, but according to inherent nature, as
POLYBIUS YOUR BISHOP has shown me." (14)

Ignatius refers to himself as the bishop of Syria (Antioch). He writes to
POLYCARP the bishop of Smyrna. He also writes to Philadelphia and Ephesus.
Therefore, only a FEW YEARS after the Lord addresses the seven churches,
and their ruling angels, Ignatius writes to THREE OF THE SAME CHURCHES.
They have ruling bishops. In fact, Ignatius maintains in his epistle to
the Ephesians that ruling bishops were settled everywhere, in all churches
at this time. The writings of Justin Martyr (who died in 165) show forth
the same teaching:

"And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country
gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the
writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then when the
reader has ceased, THE PRESIDENT verbally instructs, and exhorts to the
imitation of these good things." (15)

The practice of a plurality of assistant bishops (in larger churches)
being led by a "president" (head-pastor) is the norm in these earliest
writings. Justin was not a Jew. Yet, he uses the same terminology that the
Jews often used to refer to their head-elder in their synagogues
("president"), as if it was common to do so. We see this Jewish head-elder
in many passages in the New Testament:

Acts 18:8 And Crispus, the CHIEF RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE, believed on the
Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and
were baptized.

The "People's New testament Commentary," on this verse, writes:

"Though the synagogue opposed, ITS PRESIDENT became a Christian with all
his family. Paul baptized him with his own hands."

In the synagogues, there were "rulers" (plural), and there was a president
among the rulers (Acts 13:15). However, at times ALL the rulers (the
president and the elders) are addressed as simply "rulers" (with no
distinctions being noted). It is the same way with bishops in the Bible.
It is the same way today.

G.H. Pember (a Brethren writer), notes:

"....the institution of presbyters [elders], being no new thing, is not
noticed in [NT] Scripture..." (16)

We simply add that the same thing is true concerning the chief
administrator, or president among these elders (as James in Acts 15), and
that the language ALREADY IN USE (i.e. "angel of the congregation") is
endorsed by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself (Revelation 1:20).

Next time, God-willing, we will examine the abundant evidence for this
word "angel" being already recognized for head-administrators of
synagogues and congregations in the first century. I will demonstrate that
it was not a strange thing to these early Christians when John wrote to
them. It was the explanation of the symbol. The first century Christians
would not have thought it to be enigmatic that the Lord would refer to
their head-pastors as "angels." I will also show that there should not be
any reason for modern Christians who study their Bibles to see it as a
strange thing.

In conclusion, we should remember that Rome will again arise and become
drunk with the blood of the saints. Let us avoid anything that will
unlawfully or unnecessarily break Christian unity. I am very willing to
take a stand on serious issues, even if almost the whole, modern Christian
world runs contrary to them. However, I also know that we must be very
careful and prudent about how, if, and when a person should leave a strong
church. The Holy Ghost equates forsaking the assembling with making great
provision for willful sin (Hebrews 10:25-26)! The head-pastor model has
enough Biblical support to reject the claims of those who seek to divide
Christians over it. And it certainly has brought forth fruit in history.
On the other hand, the anti-head-pastor movement appears to have a history
of disintegration and division.

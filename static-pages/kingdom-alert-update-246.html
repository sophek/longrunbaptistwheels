[The following sermon, preached in 1840, is a much needed rebuke to the
secular, "worldly-television-and-movie-watching" that is so prevalent
among Christians today. May these words from generations ago stir many
Christians today to forsake non-Christian entertainments and thus keep
themselves unspotted from the world. - Joey Faust.]

EXCERPTS FROM: INFLUENCE OF THEATRES: A LECTURE ON THE NATURE AND TENDENCY
OF THE STAGE, BY THOMAS BRAINERD, 1840
***************************************************************************

Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners. - 1 Cor. 15:33.

â€¦We see how these establishments force themselves upon our notice. We see
how they are commended to our families. Shall we put away the prejudices
of education, and go with our children to share in the amusements of the
theatre?

I am no enemy to necessary recreation and safe amusements. Theatres are
either safe or pernicious, either moral or immoral, in their tendency. If
they be moral and instructive, as they claim to be, then it is my duty to
urge you to go, and my duty to lead the way. If, on the other hand, they
be wasteful of time and money, and most pernicious in their moral bearing,
then I am under a solemn obligation to warn this audience against their
influence. If theatres be necessary and safe, it is not enough that the
pulpit is silent; it must mingle its voice with the daily press in
chanting their praises. But if these establishments be always pernicious -
if, from their very nature, they are fountains of moral corruption, and
the pests of society - then the more embellished and attractive, and the
more commended by the daily press, by so much the more is every preacher
of the gospel under obligations to strip off their false covering, and
raise a salutary note of alarm.

â€¦These are public institutions daily forced on your attention and mine.
Believing them to be most mischievous in their moral tendency, most
ruinous to the happiness of families, and most fatal to the prospects,
temporal and eternal, of our youth, - who has a right to complain if I
express concerning them my deliberate convictions?â€¦

The first objection which I shall urge against theatrical amusements, is
their waste of time.

This is an argument better estimated at the close of life than in its
progress. However anxious some may be to kill time in the days of health
and prosperity, they learn to appreciate its value as its last hours plume
their wings for flightâ€¦

It is the nature of theatrical amusements to induce a desire for
repetition. The thrilling excitement which they create and sustain,
originates a disrelish for more sober recreations; and hence when one has
become accustomed to such amusements at the theatre, he is dissatisfied
with an evening spent out of the theatre.

Four hours of the evening devoted to laughing at comic buffoonery, or
weeping luxuriously at the catastrophes of mock tragedy! Employ this time
in business, and, with the blessing of God, it is transmuted into the
means of present competence and of future wealth: employ it in useful
readingâ€¦and it accumulates a treasure of useful knowledge to be the
cheerer of solitude, the means of respectability and usefulness, the
ornament of wealth, and the refuge of adversity. Occupy these wasted hours
in the family circle in cheerful converse, and in mutual efforts to
promote social felicity, and they would render home a spot verdant and
beautiful in the desert of the world: occupy them in seeking out and
relieving the sorrows of the poor, the sick, the homeless stranger, and in
binding up the heart crushed under life's woes, and you light up many a
gloomy dwelling with renewed hope and peace; you rekindle warmth on the
cold hearth of the orphan, and make the heart of the widow, sitting
desolate and solitary, to sing for joy. Use these hours for the service of
God - in the closet, the social meeting, and the sanctuary, or in active
efforts to restore the prodigal, exiled and starving, to the bread of his
father's house - and you open, by the grace of GOD, over your own undying
spirit, a window through which the light and peace of a better world dawns
upon your hopes; and you prepare yourself, as one who has turned many to
righteousness, to shine as a star, undimmed even by the brightness of
Heaven's firmament, for ever and ever. With the possibility, the
necessity, the privilege - nay, the solemn duty of using time for some of
these noble purposes, who can afford to waste his hours amid the mockery
of theatrical amusements? Remember it was the UNPROFITABLE servant who was
cast into outer darkness.

My second objection against theatrical amusements, is the waste of money
which they occasionâ€¦It not unfrequently happens that children in poverty
and starvation would be greatly blessed by the money which their parents
have squandered in fashionable folly. But admit that your means are so
abundant that your own family, in your estimation, is placed almost beyond
the possibility of want, just open your eyes to the condition of the
suffering poor in this city - let the vail of widows and the cry of
orphans break upon your ear - go and gaze upon the mother who attempts to
save her children from the winter's blast by drawing them to her own
chilled bosom - go and look at six hundred millions of Pagans waiting to
be supplied with the word of God, and the institutions of civilization and
Christianity; - and then, in view of your final account, ask if you can
squander your money upon the theatre without guiltâ€¦.

My third objection against theatrical amusements is, that their moral
tendency in all ages and among all nations has been most eminently
pernicious. This is a grave charge and requires to be sustained by strong
testimony. A theatre always furnishes facilities for intemperanceâ€¦the
peace of so many families - the blood of so many immortal souls - always
rises and flourishes under the shade of a theatreâ€¦.

How many of you would hold a seat in a house thus haunted by the dark
spirits of evil? Some may say these scenes show to our children the world
as it is. But is it safe to associate youth daily with corruption to show
them the world?

'Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, That to be hated needs but to be
seen; But seen too oft - familiar with her face - We first abhor - then
pity - then embrace.'

â€¦The theatre is immoral in its tendency, be cause of the false standard of
character which it sets up and applauds. Our youth, in public journals,
find constant commendations of theatre actors - in the theatre they see
these favorite performers welcomed with shouts of applause. The love of
praise is a universal, and, under proper limitations, a salutary
characteristic of every human being. No passion is stronger than the
desire of fame. When applause follows virtue, then it ennobles and
elevates the aspirations of youth. But when it is lavishly poured out upon
persons of loose moral principle and of licentious lives, upon persons who
have conferred upon community no substantial benefits, and whose lauded
gifts terminate, perhaps, in the power of memory and mimicry, then
applause becomes a premium for corruption - and no wonder if we find our
clerks and apprentices, ourâ€¦sons and daughters, in the rehearsal of comic
buffoonery, or in the heroics of mock tragedy, on their way to immortal
fame. Could not many fathers and many masters in this city testify that
this is the process by which their children or their apprentices have been
led to ruin?â€¦.

And what is generally ridiculed in modern comedy? Not intemperance,
unkindness, libertinism, idleness, profligacy, fraud and impiety.
Simplicity is ridiculed under the imputation of ignorance of the world.
Honest labour is made contemptible by its association with blundering
stupidity. Religion is reviled under the caricature of cant or hypocrisy.
Gentleness and forbearance are made odious by association with a spirit
mean and cowardly. The applauded hero of the modern drama is the rich,
proud, chivalrous, revengeful and buckish dandy. The heroine is the idle,
romantic and passionate belle. Whoever saw the character of the skilful
and laborious mechanic - of the enterprising merchant - of the faithful
teacher of our youth - of the honest labourer, represented with eclat on
the stage?

â€¦Hence the stage, by establishing a false standard of character - by its
inability to encourage men in the sober duties of life - by its direct
ridicule of these duties, and by commendation of passions at once violent
and pernicious, has always been and always will be most immoral in its
tendencies and results. Parents, would you lead your children where they
would see a character constantly applauded, the very opposite of that
which you wish them to exhibit in life?

Fourthly, The tendency of dramatic tragedy is to harden the heart against
sympathy with real suffering. In real life, human sufferings are
contemplated at periods relatively infrequent, so that the heart has power
to recover itself from one shock before it feels anotherâ€¦Hence few
individuals are daily wrought up to that excessive excitement in view of
suffering, which, in its reaction, finally benumbs the heart and chills
the sympathies. In dramatic tragedy, all this is reversed. The characters
selected occupy just that lofty station in life which makes a fall most
appalling. One scene of suffering is made to follow another in rapid
succession. The changes of an entire life in the history of kings and
princes are compressed into a few hours. By this process, the passions are
wrought up to excessive and thrilling excitement. This excitement, though
coveted, is unnatural, and the heart, striving against the sympathetic
pain of its presence, and seeking natural repose, becomes more and more
indurated, so that finally the tragedy, which once convulsed with sobs and
tears, can be witnessed without emotion! Habit makes suffering familiar,
and strips it of power to excite sympathy. Thus, by the common law of
England, a butcher was not allowed to pronounce as a juror on the guilt of
a man tried for his life. This, while it acknowledged our principle,
pushed it to a ridiculous extreme. In Rome, under Nero, ladies could look
on not only without pain, but with every demonstration of pleasure, to see
Christians wrapped in combustibles and burning, as tapers, to illumine the
public walks, or torn in pieces by wild beasts in the amphitheatreâ€¦.Now,
if the heart finally becomes hardened by habit, so that it can view the
astounding catastrophes of dramatic tragedy with almost no emotion, what
must be its effect in steeling the sympathies against the ordinary
miseries of life? There may be a starving family in a neighbouring court,
a sick and dying domestic in a garret, or a poor relative reduced from
affluence to beggary. But what are all these to the theatre-going lady,
who has been accustomed every night to see kings dethroned, imprisoned,
and murdered; princes wandering in beggary and starvation; nobles outlawed
and put to death; mothers butchered in presence of their children, and
maidens betrayed and seeking revenge with a dagger or with poison? What
are the real ills of life to one who lives amid scenes like these?â€¦.In the
worst days of the French Revolution, when the streets of the capital
flowed with warm blood, the theatres were never better attended.
Multitudes went with a high zest from the mock tragedies of the drama to
gaze delighted on the real tragedies of the guillotine. Save me and mine
from the tender mercies of such as have daily poured out their sympathy on
fictitious sorrow, until the hackneyed heart has now no deep affections; I
would as soon trust the strength of a man who had kept an open vein for
the daily waste of his own blood.

Finally, Contemplate the impurity of most of the plays acted in the
theatre. Here, for many reasons, I prefer to use the language of Dr.
Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and President of
the College of New Jersey. In a published article, he says:

'Where can plays be found that are free from impurity either directly or
by allusion and double meaning? It is amazing to think that women who
pretend to decency and reputation, whose brightest ornament ought to be
modesty, should continue to abet, by their presence, so much unchastity as
is to be found in a theatre. How few plays are acted which a modest woman
can see consistently with decency? No woman of reputation, much less of
piety, who has been ten times in a play house, durst repeat in company all
she has heard there. With what consistency they return to the same school
of lewdness they themselves best knew.'

I think it was Cicero who said he wondered how two heathen priests,
conscious of imposing on the credulity of the people, could look each
other in the face without laughing. We may be allowed to wonder how two
modern fine ladies, in their exit from a theatre, can look each other in
the face without blushing.

You may imagine that the speaker is bigoted and illiberal. Listen then to
the testimony of moralists of other ages and nations.

Plato says, "Plays raise the passions and pervert the use of them, and of
consequence are dangerous to morality."

Aristotle says, "The seeing of plays and comedies should be forbidden to
young people, until age and discipline have made them proof against
debauchery."

Tacitus says, "The German women were guarded against danger, and preserved
their purity, by having no play houses among them." Germany sent out no
missionary dancers in the days of Tacitus.

The poet Ovid, himself not too moral, advises the Emperor Augustus "to
suppress theatrical amusements, as a grand source of moral corruption."

Rousseau, resisting the introduction of the stage into Geneva, calls it "a
monument of luxury and effeminacy," and asks, "Where would be the
imprudent mother who would dare to carry her daughter to this dangerous
school? And what respectable woman would not think herself dishonoured by
going there?"

Archbishop Tillotson calls the play house "the devil's chapel, a nursery
of licentiousness and vice, which ought not to be tolerated among a
civilized, much less a Christian people."

Dr. Johnson, speaking of Collier's view of "The Immorality of the English
Stage," says, "The wise and pious caught the alarm, and the nation
wondered that it had suffered irreligion and licentiousness to be taught
openly at the public charge."

President Dwight says of plays, "What art, labour, and genius are engaged
in them to garnish gross and dreadful vice? How great a part are mere
means of pollution: all the course of exhibition, except a little part
thrust in as a sacrifice to decency and reputation, is formed of polluted
sentiments and polluted characters. From the stage, men are directly
prepared to go to the brothel. The corruption of the one fits the mind to
direct its course to the other."

You see how heathen moralists and Christian divines harmonize in their
views of the stage. The speaker, then, in raising a note of warning
against its temptations, only echoes the almost unbroken and universal
testimony of good men, that theatres throw a moral miasma on every
community doomed to endure their presence and polluting tendency. The
Dramatic Art took its rise at Athens, amid the orgies of Bacchus. It was
an exhalation from the frantic revels of a periodical national abandonment
to intoxication and debauchery; and though at first limited and regulated
by law, and more recently refined by public sentiment, as to its grosser
abominations, it has retained, in all ages, a tendency to lead back
communities and nations to the Bacchanalian corruption in which it
originated.

To this view of the nature and tendency of the stage, I have only to add
the exhortation of the text, "Be not deceived."

1st. "Be not deceived" by your past experience. Moral poison is not like
the venom of the asp, killing by one deadly blow. It more resembles the
contagion of a fatal disease, which insinuates its virus without any pain
to startle, or any immediate effects to alarm. That you are not conscious
of any pernicious effects is no evidence that your moral principles have
not been impaired; for moral poison, while it taints, also benumbs the
conscience and the heart. The causes of your ruin may be accumulating and
combining, while you are more and more secure in moral apathyâ€¦

2nd. "Be not deceived" by evil example. In the road to ruin there was
never a want of very respectable and fashionable pioneers. The most ultra
fashionable and exquisite, if they associate with the mass no where else,
have generally not been so "exclusive" as to refuse to walk with them in
the "broad road." It was once fashionable in a certain place to cry
"Crucify him, crucify him - away with this fellow from the earth." When
agitating the question how we may protect our present and eternal
interests, and how by example we may shelter the young from those vices,
which ruin alike the body and the soul, we cannot pause to inquire what
may, in any given time and place, be fashionable.

But it is denied that in this city it is fashionable to attend the
theatre. Probably not one in twenty of our citizens ever enter these
establishments. Among the most respectable and wealthy merchants, among
the great majority in the learned professions, among the enterprising
mechanics, among the really intelligent, refined and virtuous portion of
the female sex, how few enter the doors of a theatre? Indeed, it would
ruin the commercial credit of any young man, to be known as devoted to
theatrical amusements. The habit of attending at these establishments
creates a suspicion as to moral worth, in either sex - a suspicion which
the closest scrutiny into the most redeeming excellencies can hardly
remove.

3rd. "Be not deceived" by your own hearts. Inclination is an unsafe moral
guide. The head of our race consulted his inclination rather than duty,
and brought the curse of sin and the penalty of death over the whole
earth. Benedict Arnold followed his inclinations when he attempted to
betray his country. He covered his name with everlasting infamy. It is not
in vain that the Bible admonishes us that he who trusts his own heart is a
fool. You may tell me, perhaps, that you are acquainted with some who have
been long in the habit of witnessing theatrical performances, but are
still apparently uncorrupted. This may be true. I have seen several
persons who escaped unhurt from the fearful wreck of the PULASKI - but
those who perished in that awful catastrophe I have not seen, nor shall I
see them until the "the sea gives up its dead."

Those whom the stage has ruined, you see not. They have passed from the
circle of respectable society, to association with profligates - to the
revels of the grog shop - to the practice of gambling and licentiousness -
to crime, degradation, and a premature grave. They have sunk too deep to
leave a ripple on the surface of respectable society. Their names you will
find on the annals of public justice, and in the records of our
penitentiariesâ€¦.May you never, like them, follow a depraved inclination,
to share their crimes and their punishment!

4th. "Be not deceived" by the public pressâ€¦As most of the worthy editors
of our daily papers may not have reflected sufficiently on the effects of
the drama to estimate its baleful influence on the public morals, we can
give them our personal respect, while at the same time we caution the
young not to be deceived by commendations of the stage. These
commendations contradict the experience of all ages.

To professors of religion, I would remark, that in this discourse I have
aimed to reach the class most exposed to temptations from the stage. It
seemed almost libellous to assume that in this enlightened age, and in
this city of churches and revivals, any professors of religion could be
patrons of a theatre.

An English writer in the time of Charles I. "made a catalogue of
authorities against the stage, which contains every name of eminence in
the heathen and Christian world - it comprehends the united testimony of
the Jewish and Christian churches - the deliberate acts of fifty-four
ancient and modern, general, national, and provincial councils and synods,
both of the western and eastern churches; the condemnatory sentence of
seventy-one ancient fathers, and one hundred and fifty modern Catholic and
Protestant authors."

With this clear, decided, universal and almost unbroken testimony of the
whole church of God - with the repeated warnings of the Holy Scriptures
against "conformity to the world" - with a perception of the ruin to which
theatres in this city have hurried so many of our youth of both sexes -
with a knowledge of the baneful influence exerted by professors of
religion when they sanction iniquity by their presence, and thus hold out
false lights to beckon souls to shipwreck and to death; - with all this in
view, it seemed slanderous to suppose that members of our churches could
so far forget their high obligations, as to abet in any manner the
abominations of the stage. If any can so tamper with temptation - if any
can so betray the honour of the Saviour, the peace of their churches, and
the safety of immortal souls under their influence, they must have
acquired a moral obtuseness and hardihood adapted to discourage any effort
for their reformation. Such would do well to remember that they may
perhaps be preparing to act as principals in a real tragedy, the most
appalling ever exhibited on earth - the tragedy of a hopeless death-bed!
From such a final "Act" in the drama of life, may GOD in his mercy
preserve them. To them I would emphatically say, "Be not deceived. God is
not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."

With this view of the Stage, and these cautions against its influence, I
have only to say to my people, in the language of the sacred volume, "Have
no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove
them."

Note:

-The American Congress, soon after the declaration of independence, passed
the following resolution.

"Whereas, true religion and good morals are the only solid foundation of
public liberty and happiness: "Resolved, That it be and hereby is
earnestly recommended to the several states, to take the most effectual
measures for the encouragement thereof - and for the suppression of
theatrical entertainments, horse-racing, gaming, and such other diversions
as are productive of idleness, dissipation, and a general depravity of
principles and manners."

WHAT SATANISTS THINK ABOUT WORLDLY TELEVISION (Wilkerson)
********************************************************************

"So called Christians going to rental stores, and renting these films. You
can go the hills of Kentucky or West Virginia and to the lonely towns of
Alaska. All through America from one end to the other, and see the big
satellite (dishes) even in the smallest towns, and now in the places where
people didn't even talk about certain things, it's happening!! The
countryside is full of incest! The number one problem now is molestation
of our children. Where are they getting it?  Could the cause be that the
very trap door of hell is open in the living room?'â€¦I'm told that many
believers are being deceived by Psychologists and being told that mature
Christians will not be affected. Who would you think wrote these words?:

'There are television sets in every home, every restaurant, every hotel
room, and every shopping mall - now they're even small enough to carry in
your pocket like electronic rosaries. It is an unquestioned part of
everyday life. Kneeling beforeâ€¦the ray god, with our TV Guide concordance
in hand, we maintain the illusion of choice by flipping channels (chapters
and verses.)'

The writer was the man who founded the most famous public Satanist
organization in America (the Church of Satan founded in 1966), Anton
LaVey. He is also the author of a number of other books including 'The
Satanic Bible'â€¦LaVey continues to promote the religious significance of
television:

'....The birth of TV was a magical event foreshadowing its Satanic
significanceâ€¦.TV's infiltration has been so gradual, so complete, that no
one even noticed. People don't need to go to church anymore; they get
their morality plays on television.'

LaVey compares satellite dishes and antennas to church-top crosses and
notes that TV has become, in effect, the major religion of the masses,
even calling the television set the Satanic family altarâ€¦In his book
entitled the 'Devil's Notebook,' published in 1992, LaVeyâ€¦describes in
detail how he sees television as THE MAJOR MAINSTREAM INFILTRATION OF THE
NEW SATANIC RELIGION.

Anton LaVey sees television as the medium through which Satanism is being
promulgated more and more. What then is Satanism?â€¦Satanism for LaVey boils
down to the worship of man. It is nothing but evolutionary humanism (man
is an animal and man sets the rules) which is the underlying philosophy of
most television programming. No wonder Lavey characterizes television the
way he does.

In his Satanic Bible, LaVey quotes someone else as saying: 'Times have
changed. Religious leaders no longer preach that all our natural actions
are sinful. We no longer think sex is dirty - or that taking pride in
ourselves is shameful - or that coveting something someone else has is
vicious...If you want proof of this, just look at how liberal the churches
have become. Why, they're practicing all the things that you (Satanists)
preach.'

LaVey goes on to say, 'Satanists hear these, and similar statements, all
the time; and they agree wholeheartedly'..."
(David Wilkerson)

NOTES AND NEWS
***********************
I am sorrowed to hear of the passing away of the lawyer, and Christian
brother, Al Cunningham. He had abundant knowledge concerning church-state
issues. He was the lawyer that represented IBT. I am thankful for the
opportunity, though brief, that I have had to know him. May the Lord bless
his wife and family.

=============================================================

Jack Van Impe has repackaged his video against my book called "The
Protestant Purgatory." His new, appealing title is: "OLYMPIC GAMES &
ETERNAL REWARDS." I do not yet know if he has changed any of the content
of this video. However, it is interesting that he now even advertises the
video by the question: "What will it take to hear Jesus say, 'Well done,
thou good and faithful servant?'" His reason for removing the warning in
matthew 25:30 from believers is that this is "for the Jews." Yet, his
quote in his promo (as well as many in the video) is from this same
parable. Therefore, I can only suppose that Van Impe believes that every
Christian will be found a "good and faithful servant" and only some of the
Tribulation Jews have to worry about Matthew 25:30. This is modern
Christianity for you since the days of Dr. Spock. But we know that Van
Impe
really does not believe that every Christian is a good and faithful
servant. Therefeore, what we have is Van Impe inserting his own idea about
what will occur to the unfaithful servant, in the very face of our Lord's
own words concerning the matter.

The JVI promo reads:

"Can a believer lose eternal rewards already earned? The Bible clearly
states "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that which
he has done, whether it be good or bad" (II Corinthians 5:10). This is the
fire test of all our works, good and bad, before the Throne of God! In
this exciting video, Dr. Jack and Rexella Van Impe answer all of your
questions concerning this judgment, including:

-What will happen when your works are fire-tested?
-Will God judge works by quality or quantity?
-Does God grade on the curve?
-Will there be sorrow in heaven as a result of this judgment?
-Can you lose previously earned rewards through careless living?
-What will it take to hear Jesus say, 'Well done, thou good and faithful
servant?'

In this powerful video teaching, Dr. Jack and Rexella Van Impe all your
questions about the judgment of believers, and show you how the life you
live today can let you shine at that moment, earning eternal crowns to
cast at the feet of the Savior!

This video was previously released as The Protestant's Purgatory."

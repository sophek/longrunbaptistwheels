            NO RESPECT FOR THE SACRED: AMERICA GROWS INCREASINGLY PROFANE This past week, two events occurred that continue to reveal to us that we are in the perilous times of 2 Timothy 3: 2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall come. 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, DESPISERS OF THOSE THAT ARE GOOD, 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, LOVERS OF PLEASURES MORE THAN LOVERS OF GOD; 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. First, pastor Greg Dixon (Sr.) sat across the street from his former church building (IBT) and watched the bull-dozers begin to tear it down. Such a sordid event, concerning God's property, has never occurred in U.S. history that I am aware of. Second, WND reported the following story on May 31: "City seizes church's land - California congregation battles government over property - The city of Cypress, Calif., has authorized the seizure of a local church's land, arguing that a house of worship is not the 'best and highest use' for the property. City officials hope to take ownership of Cottonwood Christian Center's land through eminent domain. While city officials say that economic development on the property would be better for the citizens of Cypress than a church, the church complains the city is being discriminatory. Cottonwood fears that if it succumbs to city officials' dictates, a precedent will be set and cities across the nation will be encouraged to seize church property to build businesses that will provide more tax dollars....Belmer said the city is considering approving the construction of a Costco warehouse on the land and that he does not believe seizing the land is in violation of the RLUIPA. Eminent domain laws were originally designed to make way for roads and dams, but cities are routinely using them as a means to build businesses...." What does this all mean? It means Americans have lost RELIGION. They have only a from of godliness at times. They are, as Esau, PROFANE: Hebrews 12:16 Lest there be any fornicator, or PROFANE person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. 17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. Profane: "irreverent to anything sacred" (Web.1828) If so many Christians currently choose money, food or the praise of men over conviction and truth, then what can we expect from these lost worldlings? There was a time when even the average citizen or political leader had some profession of the FEAR OF GOD. But now we have lost it in our country. If Christians would begin to exercise reverence and godly fear before God, perhaps the unbelievers would have some alarm. But if they see the saints without fear, and without fruit, what must they think about our God? Let us pray for our leaders in America, secular and religious. We are in great need of mercy and revival in our churches. The average American sees the local church as simply another American business. Let's do everything we can to show them that this is not so; that there IS a difference between the holy and the profane.

FROM THE EDITOR

I have been engaged in an ongoing email "debate" with a man named Herb Evans over the subject matter of "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" It is not a formal debate (he will not agree to such). But there have been hundreds of pages already on dozens of warnings passages. If you are interested in receiving these e-mails just send me back and e-mail and let me know. Aside from his railings, it is a good opportunity to see the issues "debated."

I had a blessed time in Chattanooga and met some new friends. Many thanks to Pastor Daniels, and the folks who put on the Bible conference there. They are all dear folks who love the Lord.

************************************************************
AN EXHORTATION CONCERNING CHURCH HOPPING
************************************************************

2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;

Genesis 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:

3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

There has never been a more crucial time to join a godly church or stay rooted in the house of God. If you have wandered away from Bethel (the house of God), it is past time to change your garments and get back to the pillar and ground of the truth! We have multiple families who have moved across the country (or are changing countries) to raise their families in a good church. May the Lord bless them. We need them.

Yet, on the other hand, there are people leaving fundamental churches, and joining with pastors who have made a choice not to preach the whole counsel of God, or they have lowered Biblical standards, for the sake of a crowd. These people are leaving churches that could be blessed by their participation, gifts and funds, to serve lukewarm churches. Some have pulled their tithes and support during godly building projects for wrong reasons (a type of extortion or attempt at pastoral blackmail!). What does the Lord think of people telling pastors, "I will leave, and talk others into leaving, and starve your family and attempt to cause this work to cease, if I do not get my way!" 

From hearing pastors, and speaking with them, and from my own experience, here are some ungodly reasons why some Christians are leaving godly churches in these final days before our Lord's return:

1. They want to "find a wife," and they think they have to do it at a lukewarm church on Sunday (forgetting that God said to love Him and His truth above such things. Besides, I have never yet seen God bless such an attempt. But I have seen Him curse it many times).

2. They got their feelings hurt (forgetting that those who love the Lord's law are not easily offended).

3. They didn't get their way, and so they will punish others by leaving in bitterness.

4. The pastor didn't let them bully others (this is his part of his job).

5. They were rebuked for gossip.

6. They want an "exciting children's program" (forgetting that a godly church is the best program, and they can play kickball somewhere else on Saturdays).

7. They wanted the thrill of leaving and having everyone concerned, chasing them, etc.

8. They realized that if they stay, they would have to grow in maturity, or be pressed to give up some fleshly sin or habit.

9. They are chasing Mammon over God, and they knew that they would soon be held accountable for working on Sundays.

10. They let a bitter sheep destroy their joy and give them a bad attitude about their church.

There are many more, but you can see some reasons why there are some Christians (who should know better) leaving and putting their time, effort and money in lukewarm churches (or simply changing to another church for an unbiblical reason). These saints may expect some immediate "blessings" (Jonah just "happened" to find a ship going away from God to Tarshish). But the whale of affliction will come in the end. And he that will not be reproved by doctrine and word must be reproved by the rod. And the rod of chastisement lasts longer, and cuts far deeper than we ever expect. Long after we have finished with sin, and are saying, "Yes Sir!" to God in repentance, the afflictions are still burning. I have a handful of letters and phone calls (more than I would like to have) from people that, after five or so years (maybe more, maybe less), want to express their regrets, or warn others not to do what they have done. I recently heard from a young woman from many years ago that expres!

 sed some deep, painful regrets.

Perhaps you would like to share your thoughts or experience (pastor or church member) for inclusion in this newsletter. We would love to hear from you. And I think many would be strengthened by your testimony of something you personally experienced yourself, or saw someone else experience.

PROPHECIES IN THE OLIVET DISCOURSE ARE FUTURE AND LITERAL: PROVEN BY THE HISTORICAL EXAMPLE IN A.D. 70
********************************************************************

Luke 21:5 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
6 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?

Matthew 23:38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

Luke 19:41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,

44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

Jesus predicted a destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. In A.D. 70, Rome attacked Jerusalem. Yet the prophecies of our Lord looked forward to a far future time, when the temple in Israel will be rebuilt and destroyed again. Another temple must be rebuilt for Antichrist to desecrate. It will be destroyed in the future. This is called double fulfillment prophecy. The first step towards a rebuilt temple is a re-instituted nation! And the nation was restored to the land in unbelief in 1948.

Forty or so years later, in A.D. 70, the Roman general, Titus, besieged Jerusalem, and destroyed the temple. Notice some history concerning the destruction in A.D. 70:

"...Titus resolved to surround the city with a wall...this work, which was worthy of months, was with incredible speed completed in three days....when the Romans had taken Jerusalem, Titus ordered his soldiers to dig up the foundations both of all the city and the temple....Terentius Rufus, who was left to command the army of Jerusalem, did with a plough-share tear up the foundation of the temple...great riches were found among the ruins, and the Romans dug it up in search of the treasures..."

(Thomas Newton, "Dissertations on the Prophecies," 1758)

"The emperor Nero, informed of the rebellion, sent his most famous general, Vespasian, with a large force to Palestine. Vespasian opened the campaign in the year 67...But events in Rome hindered him from completing the victory, and required him to return thither. Nero had killed himself. The emperors, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius followed one another in rapid succession....Vespasian, in the year 69, was universally proclaimed emperor, and restored order and prosperity. His son, Titus, who himself ten years after became emperor...then undertook the prosecution of the Jewish war, and became the instrument in the hand of God of destroying the holy city and the temple. He had an army of not less than eighty thousand trained soldiers...In April, A.D. 70, immediately after the Passover, when Jerusalem was filled with strangers, the siege began. The zealots rejected, with sneering defiance, the repeated proposals of Titus and the prayers of Josephus, who accompanied him as interprete!

 r and mediator; and they struck down every one who spoke of surrender...The crucifixion of hundreds of prisoners (as many as five hundred a day) only enraged them the more. Even the famine which began to rage and sweep away thousands daily, and forced a woman to roast her own child, the cries of mothers and babes...could not move the crazy fanatics....[The temple] was burned on the tenth of August, A.D. 70, the same day of the year on which, according to tradition, the first temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar." (Schaff, "History")

This has stirred a debate among fundamental Christians, and the liberal higher-critics. And in our times, the view of the old liberals and infidels is growing in popularity.

The controversy is rooted in the proper method of Biblical interpretation:

Literal Interpretation 
vs.
Allegorical (Figurative) Interpretation

Liberals think that only the spiritual "truths" are inspired. They really don't believe the Bible is true in anything else. They do not hold it to be a true history, or a true guide to geography, biology, astronomy, physics, or even psychology. To these liberals, the Holy Bible is simply a devotional for obtaining a good "Positive Mental Attitude."

This is why they have to chop it up so much - to take all the "beware," and "thou shalt not's," out of it.

They do not take the Bible seriously as a letter from God to mankind, telling us what is wrong with us, how we can be saved, how to think, and how to act.

The problem is that they think that they are too smart for the Bible. And they are too afraid of appearing foolish in the eyes of the world. They love the praise and esteem of man more than the praise of God. And to the degree that you think the Bible is true, and the degree you believe that it should rule and guide your life, is the degree that you are a usually deemed to be a fool in the eyes of the world!:

1 Corinthians 1:23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

1 Corinthians 3:18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

This means that if you desire for the majority of scholarly, "educated" people in the world to pat you on the back and say that you are smart, and educated like them - YOU WILL HAVE TO BELIEVE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU IGNORANT IN GOD'S EYES! But if you want to be wise in God's eyes, you must believe things that will make the world mock you and laugh at you!:

Luke 16:15 ...that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

Malachi 3:15 And now we call the proud happy...

Romans 2:29 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly...whose praise is not of men, but of God.

John 12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:

43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

Luke 9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

We must begin, right now, to despise the shame the world will heap upon those who will say: "I believe that if Jesus said it, that settles it!"

But preterists cannot go this far. So they must retreat into figurative interpretation. What is the end result of all of this liberal, figurative babble? It would mean that the days that were supposed to be the worst that the world will ever see, are made to be all behind us! The prophecies of Jesus are all behind us. They are all figurative.

Such ideas will obviously keeps sinners and carnal Christians in their sins. Noyse was a so-called Bible teacher in the 19th century who adopted this figurative view. He said everything in Matthew 24 occurred in A.D. 70. Since he thought he had gotten rid of the Second Coming, and the judgment, he started a free-love commune, one hundred years before Woodstock!

This view is called PRETERISM (for past). It is opposed to FUTURISM (where we obviously see the word future).

PRETERISM (i.e. The temple prophecies, etc., were all completely fulfilled in A.D. 70)

FUTURISM (i.e. Jesus was looking far past the first, partial destruction of the temple in A.D. 70, to a time that is still future to us today - though approaching quickly.)

Preterists also teach that the prophecies in the Book of Revelation all relate to the Roman attack upon Jerusalem in A.D. 70, even though the Book was written at least 20 years after that war. But they hold to an early date, in order to teach their view - even though the earliest Christian writings hold that the Book was written after A.D. 70.

If Jesus was only referring to a destruction of the temple in His generation, then we must hold to figurative interpretation of many of the prophecies our Lord gave in Matthew 24. For this reason, preterists believe that the coming of the Lord and the gathering of the elect by angels, are figurative events.

Notice some other things that Jesus predicted would occur at the same time:

Luke 21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

Jerusalem was surrounded by the Roman army, and it, and its temple, were attacked and destroyed around 40 years or so after the Lord uttered this prophecy. But what about the roaring waves? The signs in the sun, moon and stars? And most of all, what about the Son of man coming in a cloud?

Hold these thoughts, and let's look at Mark's version:

Mark 13:14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:

19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.

24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
25 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

Immediately, any eight-year old, who can read, can see that when the temple is destroyed, the Lord appears in the sky and will literally gather His people to Himself!

But the problem is that these latter things are abominable to the worldly wise. They describe a world situation where THEY are not in control. God is reaching IN to the aquarium, so to speak!

So what do they say? They are forced to say that these words of the Lord all refer to the destruction in A.D. 70, and the other events predicted by the Lord are all speaking of basic, earthly things, using apocalyptic or figurative language! In other words, they say, YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THESE THINGS LITERALLY!

But did you know that there is historical evidence for STRANGE SIGNS in the heavens in the 1st century? No, Christ certainly did not return then (literally or figuratively) as preterists say. However, those who will try to teach that this language in the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21) is FIGURATIVE, are refuted by the HISTORICAL EVIDENCE.

First, the fulfillments in the New Testament of Old Testament prophecy prove to us that prophetic language is literal (unless it is obviously symbolic, as when a symbol is explained by the Bible). For example, Jesus being born in Bethlehem, riding on an ass, and having stripes (Isaiah 53) on His body were all fulfilled literally in the New Testament. Added to this, we have the fact that prophecy often has a double application. There is a near, historical, partial application, and then there is the final, full, literal, future fulfillment. In other words, the events of A.D. 70 were only an EXAMPLE of the future fulfillment, when Israel will again be a nation, and the temple will be rebuilt, and then it will be destroyed again under Antichrist.

These last facts were mocked and derided until Israel became a nation again! Now the mockers are largely silent. If the nation has been restored (un unbelief), it is now reasonable to expect a temple to be rebuilt. And there are movements in Israel today, trying to accomplish this very thing! Unbelief is surely and interesting and sad thing to behold.

Of course, there is an ever-growing movement of preterists. It is a new generation of spiritualizers that have arisen in fulfillment of Peter's words:

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

These preterists are teaching that all the events of Matthew 24 have already been fulfilled in A.D. 70. They teach that we must understand "apocalyptic language." They say that the things that Jesus predicted (His coming in the clouds, etc.) are figurative. In other words, they say the coming of Christ was fulfilled at the coming of Titus (the type of Antichrist!).

We have already mentioned the fact that much of OT prophecy was fulfilled literally in the NT. This shows us that the REST of it, including NT prophecy, will also be fulfilled literally. But on top of this fact, every Christian who opposes preterism should realize that there is nothing wrong or unbiblical about seeing the events of A.D. 70 as an EXAMPLE. The bouncing ball of prophecy often hits once, before it finds it final mark. And when we begin to examine the events of A.D. 70, we find immediately that the preterist refutes himself with his own example! The preterist believes that A.D. 70 was a total fulfillment of Matthew 24. Yet, when we study the historical events of A.D. 70 we find that EVEN IN THE PARTIAL FULFILLMENT THE LANGUAGE WAS FULFILLED LITERALLY! Remember again the Lord's prophecy:

Luke 21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

Now if we examine the PARTIAL (example) application of our Lord's words, and find that the desolation of Jerusalem was a literal desolation of a literal city, and then we find out that, incredibly, the signs in the heavens were LITERAL signs, this leaves us with the only conclusion that the sea and waves roaring, and the return of the Son of Man will be just as literal! In A.D. 70, the Lord has given us a firstfruits example. He has given us the earnest of the coming fulfillment:

Luke 21:11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

If city meant city, and destruction meant destruction, and sights and signs meant sights and signs from heaven, then the preterist, by calling attention to the events of A.D. 70, has robbed himself of his one argument (and it was a weak argument to begin with). He has disproved his own theory. He has used the events of A.D. 70 to teach that Jesus meant only these events, yet by doing so, he has called attention to the fact that JESUS WAS NOT USING FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE! When the Lord uses figurative language, He begins His section on the parable of the fig tree. The earthquakes, the sea roaring, the signs and sights from heaven, the signs in the sun, etc. are ALL LITERAL.

LITERAL SIGNS IN THE HEAVENS IN A.D. 70:

"[Josephus] relates accordingly, that a star hung over the city like a sword, and the comet continued for a whole year...[and] that before the setting of the sun there were seen over all the country chariots and armies fighting in the clouds, and besieging cities...But it may add some weight to his relation, that Tacitus [56-120], the Roman historian, also gives us a summary account of the same occurrences."

(Thomas Newton, "Dissertations on the Prophecies," 1758)

"I suppose the account of it would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armour were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities." (Josephus, "Jewish Wars")

Tacitus was neither a Jew nor a Christian. And, as Newton reminds us, he attests to the same LITERAL signs in the heavens:

"[The army of Titus included] a strong contingent of Arabs, who hated the Jews...With this force Titus entered the enemy's territory, preserving strict order on his march...At last he encamped near Jerusalem....Things sacred with us, with them have no sanctity, while they allow what with us is forbidden....The Egyptians worship many animals and images of monstrous form; the Jews have purely mental conceptions of Deity, as one in essence. They call those profane who make representations of God in human shape out of perishable materials....Jerusalem is the capital. There stood a temple of immense wealth....Titus himself had Rome with all its wealth and pleasures before his eyes. Jerusalem must fall at once, or it would delay his enjoyment of them....The temple resembled a citadel, and had its own walls...There had been seen hosts joining battle in the skies, the fiery gleam of arms, the temple illuminated by a sudden radiance from the clouds. The doors of the inner shrine were!

  suddenly thrown open, and a voice of more than mortal tone was heard to cry that the gods were departing. At the same instant there was a mighty stir as of departure. Some few put a fearful meaning on these events, but in most there was a firm persuasion, that in the ancient records of their priests was contained a prediction of how at this very time the East was to grow powerful, and rulers, coming from Judaea, were to acquire universal empire. These mysterious prophecies had pointed to Vespasian and Titus, but the common people, with the usual blindness of ambition, had interpreted these mighty destinies of themselves, and could not be brought even by disasters to believe the truth." (Tacitus, "Histories")

Since the historical EXAMPLE was ALREADY literal, we can expect the final fulfillment to also be literal. If the firstfruits be literal, then the whole harvest is literal.

And if the temple and city were literal, and the destruction was literal, and the signs in the heavens were literal, why would anyone expect the COMING of the Lord and the ANGELS, and the GATHERING of the elect to be FIGURATIVE?!:

Luke 21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
 
Matthew 24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

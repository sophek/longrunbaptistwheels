        <h1>DARE WE FORGET! ROMANISM RUINS LIBERTY</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "An impression is extensively prevalent that the Popery of the present day is something entirely different from the Popery of the dark ages, when amidst the gloom and the superstition of the world's midnight, it reigned Despot of the World. Yet while this change for the better is charitably believed by some lukewarm protestants, who are contented to lay down their weapons and forsake their watch-tower, it is absolutely and unequivocally denied by the most celebrated champions of Rome."
(John Dowling, "History of Romanism," 1881; reprinted by Vance Publications)

Increasingly, fundamental Christians are yoking with Romanists in the defense of liberty and justice for all. As governments grow to mammoth proportions, and personal freedoms are encroached, it is often easy to leave one gate unguarded as we watch and pray to secure another. But let us remember that Romanism is no friend to liberty! Wherever and whenever it gains any ascendancy, it breeds the ruin of freedom, prosperity and truth.

In the first few centuries after Christ, the Roman bishops labored hard to bring all other bishops under their control. The early Roman councils soon determined that Christians should be tortured or executed if the Roman bishop deemed they were "heretics." It was Romanism that buried the West into the miry dark ages, blinded the people in fanatical superstition, and murdered innumerable Christians for centuries to come. Has this diabolical system, in our day, lost its lust for blood and power? Have its popes ever sincerely repented of their antichristian claims and deeds? Do not the Holy Scriptures themselves plainly predict the FUTURE rise of this papal, whorish persecutor, directly before the coming of Christ?:

Revelation 17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.

But how will such incredible things come to pass? Where does the land of liberty sink to with her wonderful Constitution? Who allows this totalitarian, Romanist Church-State to arise, and destroy again, in the name of tolerance and Christianity? Who forgets the clear lessons of history? Could it be that the watchmen on the wall should fall asleep in the land of liberty? Could it be that the smooth, siren songs of the television and movie theaters are rapidly deluding preachers into losing their hatred for sin and lies? Shall we applaud this diabolical system that is the most intolerant of all institutions and an enemy to liberty and truth? Bible believing Christians do not call for the persecution of Roman Catholics. We abhor the very thought. However, it is a sad, dangerous day for liberty and truth when toleration is proclaimed as meaning that no lie is to be exposed by Scripture and reason, and no corruption is to be publicly rebuked! Compromised preachers, daily soaking in the bluish glow of the world's filth, do not even realize that they are losing their intensity and boldness. The dire prophecies of Scripture certainly must be fulfilled; but they do not have to come to pass because of our own culpability! Shall we not sound the alarm? If we do not, the responsibility for the future martyrdoms in Revelation 17 will rest partly upon our own heads for failing to warn people (Ezekiel 33:6). Are these words simply bigoted, alarmist propaganda? No! The following quotes and facts will prove that I am not mad, but that I am speaking forth the words of truth and soberness.

Early Romanism: An Enemy to Truth and Liberty

Today, too many people are unfamiliar with the arrogant rights that Romanism has granted to itself throughout history. These supposed rights to control the property, wealth, speech, and even the THOUGHTS of the world, by divine sanction, have never been given up and laid aside by Rome. John W. Robbins writes:

"In a letter to the archbishop of Ravenna (1198), Innocent III wrote: 'Ecclesiastical liberty is nowhere better cared for than where the Roman church has full power in both temporal and spiritual affairs.' That is the meaning of RELIGIOUS LIBERTY in the thought of the papacy down to the twentieth century: full power for the Roman Church-State in both temporal and spiritual affairs." (John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.120-121)

Robbins continues:

"In the sixteenth century, the Council of Trent declared that the pope has 'all power on Earth....All temporal power is his; the dominion, jurisdiction, and government of the whole Earth is his by divine right. All rulers of the Earth are his subjects and must submit to him.'"(John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.131)

Romanism in the 19th Century: Still an Enemy to Truth and Liberty

Romanism was not shy about decrying freedom of conscience, speech and of the press in the 19th century. It could not and would not conceal its diabolical hatred for America:

"On December 8, 1864, Pius IX issued the encyclical Quanta Cura, containing a 'Syllabus of Errors,' not Roman errors, of course, but a vitriolic condemnation of all modernity....Here are a few of Pius IX's own words: 15. No man is free to embrace and profess that religion which he believes to be true, guided by the light of reason....24. The [Roman] Church has the power of employing force and of exercising direct and indirect temporal power....54. Kings and Princes are not only NOT exempt from jurisdiction of the [Roman] Church, but are subordinate to the Church in litigated questions of jurisdiction. 55. The [Roman] Church ought to be in union with the State, and the State with the [Roman] Church....77. It is necessary even in the present day that the [Roman] Catholic religion shall be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship.' Six years later, after Pius IX had rigged the first Vatican Council so that it would officially declare him infallible, William Gladstone, Prime Minister of England, wrote a pamphlet titled, 'The Vatican Decrees and Their Bearing on Civil Allegiance after 1870.' In his pamphlet Gladstone wrote: 'With this decree, the claims of Innocent III over mankind have BEEN RESURRECTED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY - LIKE SOME MUMMY PICKED OUT OF ITS DUSTY SARCOPHAGUS.'" (John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.144)

Again, Robbins writes:

"The Roman Church-State denounced equality before the law, for the simple reason that no other society on Earth is in fact its equal. Leo XII wrote: 'The cause of all these evils lies principally in this: that men have despised and rejected the holy and august authority of the [Roman] Church....We declare THAT WE SHALL NEVER CEASE TO CONTEND FOR THE FULL OBEDIENCE TO OUR AUTHORITY, FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL OBSTACLES PUT IN THE WAY OF OUR FULL EXERCISE OF OUR MINISTRY AND POWER, and for the RESTORATION to that condition of things in which the provident design of the Divine Wisdom HAD FORMERLY PLACED THE ROMAN PONTIFF...' (Leo XIII, quoted by John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.146)

Romanism continued to grow in mammoth proportions in 19th century America:

"The Roman Church-State is the oldest institution continually in existence, tracing its roots at least to the sixth century....though its fortunes fell after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, IT HAS MADE A REMARKABLE RESURGENCE IN THE PAST CENTURY....by the last third of the nineteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church had become the LARGEST religious organization in the United States." (John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999, p.9, 81)

These facts did not go unnoticed by some preachers and writers of the 19th century. There were many warnings given to Christians in those days, which clearly documented the fact that Romanism had NOT changed its designs, methods, claims, or intentions. These men proved from Roman Catholic writings themselves, that Romanism was an enemy to both Gospel truth and the American Constitution.

For example, in the 19th century, Baptist writer, John Dowling called attention to the incredible words of the Pope himself, as well as to strong statements found in many Catholic periodicals; he proved that Popery was not changed in its heart. He quotes an Encyclical from Pope Gregory XVI, in 1832, which states:

"From that polluted fountain of indifference flows that absurd and erroneous doctrine, or rather raving, in favor and in defense of 'liberty of conscience,' for which most pestilential error, the course is opened by that entire and wild liberty of opinion which is everywhere attempting the overthrow of civil and religious institutions....hence, in one word, that PEST OF ALL OTHERS most to be dreaded in a state, UNBRIDLED LIBERTY OF OPINION....Nor can we augur more consoling consequences to religion and to government, from the zeal of some to SEPARATE THE CHURCH FROM THE STATE, and to burst the bond which unites the priesthood of the empire. For it is clear that this union is dreaded by the PROFANE LOVERS OF LIBERTY, only because it has never failed to confer prosperity on both.....Hither tends that worst and never sufficiently to execrated and detested LIBERTY OF THE PRESS for the diffusion of all manner of writings, which some so loudly contend for and so actively promote." (John Dowling, "History of Romanism," 1881)

Dowling continues:

"A few extracts from Roman Catholic papers are here collected to show that the intolerant, and persecuting, and grasping spirit of popery remains unchanged....says the 'Pittsburg Catholic Visitor': "For our own part, we take this opportunity of explaining our hearty delight at the suppression of the protestant chapel in Rome. This may be thought intolerant; but when, we ask, DID WE EVER PROFESS TO BE INTOLERANT OF PROTESTANTISM, or to favor the doctrine that protestantism ought to be tolerated? On the contrary we HATE protestantism - we detest it with our whole heart and soul, and we pray our aversion to it may never decrease....we are sincerely glad the enemies of truth are no longer allowed to meet together in the capital of the Christian world.' The 'Shepherd of the Valley,' published at St. Louis, says,'....When protestants ask Catholics to declare that they accept the foolish proposition that absolute toleration is the duty of all governments, they ask them to assent to a statement which is repugnant to faith, to sound reason, to the practice of all governments, Christian or pagan, Catholic or Protestant, and to the common sense of mankind....The right of preventing the introduction of protestantism into countries in which it has not appeared, is simply the right of repressing doctrines subversive of that social order which government is instituted to preserve....Liberty of conscience, in the sense in which protestants use the words...which frees conscience from the obligation of conforming to the truth, is NOT ADMITTED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. To say that a man is a Catholic, is to say that he rejects it: and THE SOONER OUR PROTESTANT FRIENDS UNDERSTAND THIS, THE BETTER....'....In another article....this same 'Shepherd of the Valley' says,...'We say that temporal punishment of heresy is a mere question of expediency; that protestants do not persecute us here, simply because they have not the power, and that where we abstain from persecuting them, they are well aware THAT IT IS MERELY BECAUSE WE CAN NOT DO SO, OR THINK THAT, BY DOING SO, WE SHOULD INJURE THE CAUSE WE WISH TO SERVE.' 'The Rambler,' another Roman Catholic paper, says, 'You ask if he (the pope) were lord in the land, and you were in a minority, if not in numbers, yet in power, what would he do to you? That, we say, would entirely depend upon circumstances. If it would benefit the cause of Catholicism, he would tolerate you; if expedient, he would imprison you, banish you, fine you - possibly he might even hang you - but be assured of one thing: he would never tolerate you for the sake of 'glorious principles' of civil and religious liberty.' In another number, the same paper says, 'Religious liberty, in the sense of a liberty possessed by every man to choose his religion, is one of the most wicked delusions ever foisted upon this age by the father of all deceit...No! Catholicism is the most intolerant of creeds. IT IS INTOLERANCE ITSELF, for it is truth itself.'....A recent number of the 'Paris Univers,' a Roman Catholic paper published in France, says, 'A heretic, examined and convicted by the church, used to be delivered over to the secular power, and punished with death. NOTHING HAS EVER APPEARED TO US MORE NECESSARY....As for myself, what I regret, I frankly confess, is, that they did not burn John Huss sooner, and that they did not also burn Luther. This happened because there was not found some prince sufficiently politic to stir up a crusade against the protestants.' The 'Catholic Review' says, 'Protestantism of every form has not, and NEVER CAN HAVE, any right where catholicity is triumphant...'....In relation to the designs of papists to take and to control the government of these United States, Father Hecker, in a recent lecture in the city of New York, said, 'The Catholic Church numbers one third of the American population, and if its membership shall increase for the next thirty years, as it has for the thirty years past, in 1900 Rome will have a majority, and be bound to take this country and keep it.' All of the above quotations are from Romish authorities." (John Dowling, "History of Romanism," 1881, p.618-621, 886-890)

A few years later, Isaac J. Lansing provided similar documentation. He writes:

"In the Encyclical and the Syllabus of 1864, the Pope denounces some of the dearest rights of man, because they are opposed to Romish absolutism....With fearful epithets the Pope denounces those who insist that governments should not inflict penalties upon such as violate the Catholic religion...[He] then proceeds to visit with his fiercest malediction, first, THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS; second, or the LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE and of worship; third, or the liberty of speech....seventh, those who declare that the church may not employ force....sixteenth, or that any other religion than the Roman religion may be established by the state; seventeenth, or that in countries called Catholic, the free exercise of other religions may be laudably allowed....Do you not see, that almost everything we hold dear is here assailed? You are accursed of Rome who maintain liberty of conscience and free worship, as do all Protestants of whom I have knowledge....this is the authority which all Romanists are bound to obey under penalty of being denounced as heretics....Cardinal McCloskey, who as Cardinal of Rome is a foreign prince exercising authority in the United States, contrary to the Constitution and the laws, says: 'The Catholics of the United States are as strongly devoted to the sustenance and maintenance of the temporal power of the Holy Father as Catholics in any part of the world, and if it should be necessary to prove it by acts, they are ready to do so.'....Father Hecker says, that ere long there is to be a state religion in this country [U.S.], and that state religion is to be Roman Catholic.' The Boston 'Pilot' says: 'The man today is living who will see the majority of the people of the American continent Roman Catholics.'"
(Rev. Isaac J. Lansing, "Romanism and the Republic," 1890)

The above writers sounded the alarm! They proved that Romanism had not changed and that it should not be cuddled and pampered. Interestingly, these men considered it highly unlikely that Rome would ever gain its foul intentions in America. They were simply pointing out that it was her GOAL to destroy American liberties and turn America into a Catholic nation. They were hopeful and confident that most Americans would awake and stop the menace of Romanism in their land of liberty. On the other hand, there were other men that understood that the Bible plainly warns that Romanism will rise again in its entire hellish monstrosity, directly before the second coming of Christ. They therefore had little confidence in the vigilance and resolve of American Christians and political leaders.

It is a fact that Christians largely ignored ALL of these warnings. The facts of history, reason and Scripture were set aside for the theater, the radio, and vain novels. This helped to create the environment we have today in our churches. Evangelical Christians in our age largely believe that Catholicism is simply a 'difference of opinion,' and that Roman Catholics are wonderful friends to liberty and truth.

Catholicism in the 20th Century: Still an Enemy to Truth and Liberty

After reading these warnings from over a century ago, it would be interesting to notice, from our standpoint, whether Catholicism ever accomplished its goals in the 20th century; and if not, how close is it to realizing them today, in 2002? Modern author, John W. Robbins, reveals that 20th century Catholicism DID NOT change its opinions in regard to the American Constitution and liberty of conscience. Instead, the Harlot is quickly climbing back into the saddle, to grasp the reins of the State. Notice the following excellent excerpts from John W. Robbins:

"The recent Council [Vatican II] reminded us...'...as all men follow justice and unite in charity, created goods should abound for them on a reasonable basis. ALL OTHER RIGHTS WHATSOEVER, including those of property and of free commerce, are to be subordinated to this principle.'" (Paul VI, 'Populorum Progressio, On the Progress of Peoples,' 1967; quoted by John W. Robbins)

"....it is the right of public authority to prevent anyone from misusing his private property to the detriment of the common good."
(The Second Vatican Council, "Gaudium et Spes," 1965; quoted by John W. Robbins)

When a person is forced to share, it is no longer "sharing," but STEALING! Romanism has always increased its own riches by stealing from others. Wherever its doctrines prevail, poverty reigns. Robbins continues to document that much of the increasing loss of American liberty in the present is due to a Roman Catholic influence on American politics:

"Pius XI told us that the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum' was instrumental in ending 'laissez-faire' capitalism in the twentieth century by ushering in the era of 'effective interference by the government.'....Pius XI's claims, though they need no confirmation, are corroborated by a column Joe Klein wrote for 'Newsweek,' February 19, 1996, titled 'A Lurch Toward Love.' Telling us that Pat Buchanan, who at that time was running for President, 'has got religion,' Kein explained: 'The religion is Roman Catholicism, the most significant in American politics, the ultimate swing vote. Catholics were the heart of the New Deal coalition. They were the Daley machine in Chicago, the Curley machine in Boston, Tammany Hall in New York, Jimmy Carter was the last Democrat to win a Catholic majority. Clinton got 43 percent of their support in 1992 (Perot had 20) [that leaves 37 percent for Bush], but Catholics voted overwhelmingly, 57 percent for Democratic Congressional candidates.' Much of the INTERFERENCE by federal, state, and local governments in the affairs of citizens, both Jo Klein and the papacy have told us, is due to Roman Catholic influence in American politics....In other nations in which Roman Catholic influence was greater, governments became even more socialist than they did in the United States....In a capitalist system, government does not own or control the means of production, subsidize churches or other institutions, provide or pay for education, retirement benefits, health insurance, recreation, or any of the other innumerable goods and services provided by governments at the end of the twentieth century." (John W. Robbins, "Ecclesiastical Megalomania," 1999)

Let us preach the Gospel to Roman Catholics. And let us never cease to proclaim the truth, and expose the lies of Romanism. This is the very thing Romanism fears the most. It has worked hard to silence the preachers and coax them away from sounding the alarm. It does not want its plans stagnated in the U.S.

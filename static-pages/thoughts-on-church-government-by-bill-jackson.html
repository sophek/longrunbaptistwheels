        <h1>THOUGHTS ON CHURCH GOVERNMENT</h1>
        <div id="content">
            By Bill Jackson (Christians Evangelizing Catholics):
Jesus had made it clear:
"Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."
Jesus is not saying it is wrong for you to have someone in the church who is great (megas, big) or chief (protos, foremost); He is merely defining the postures of those who are church leaders. We see, as church history unfolds, a three-fold result of ecclesiological leadership. To one extreme is the Roman Catholic paradigm. It is hierarchical, and it will behoove us to take some time to explore the origin of that word and its implications.
...Besides the direct words of Jesus quoted above, God gave us a further word to warn His people, and He used the one man who would be later charged with instituting the very system which God decried. In 1 Peter 5:3 we read:
"Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock."
...We must not...rush to the extreme of thinking that having a multitude of popes in every assembly is better than having one pastor, because these many popes can still exercise dictatorial principles on the people.
…Irenaeus realized the necessity of having some kind of a structure. The one that he proposed was not in itself sinful, but could have led either to corruptions that would be anathema to God, or those that were Biblical. His concept seemed to be that there should be leadership, but the coming centuries would prove how biblical that leadership turned out to be in the movements that sprang from the initial realization of the necessity of leadership.
One road this concept traveled was to elevate the leadership to have an area chief rule over several smaller churches, and, together with the role of the priest now called, by Cyprian, a hierus, you have the embryonic form of the Hierarchy, rule of priests (hierus-archy). Heading in this direction and spurred on by the Roman concepts of government, this quickly developed to the present set up we see in Catholicism – Pope, Cardinal, Archbishop, Bishop, Priest all in authority over the church.
The way to solve a problem is not to radically reject off hand everything that caused the development of wrong. This is what we call throwing the baby out with the bath water. After all, it was the baby who made the water dirty, so he should be chucked out as well.
The correct way to solve a problem is to look at the Bible to see what went wrong and, going back to that point in time, to proceed biblically. The question before us is two-fold. First, does the Bible allow for one-man-leadership in a local church and if so, what are the legitimate boundaries of his rule? We may, in the long run, although leaning toward one system or the other, find out that specifics are peripheral and should not cause division among the brethren. But we can find some Biblical principles that can be the measure of Scriptural correctness for any system.
There are bad examples of one-man-rule in the local church. A look at the Shepherding movement gives us one example of something gone very wrong...
...It would be hard to fit the heavenly angel in Revelation 2 and 3.

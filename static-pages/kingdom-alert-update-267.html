THE HORSELEACH: PASSIVE FATHERS AND VAMPIRE CHILDREN 
******************************************************************

Fathers don't let your babies grow up to be VAMPIRES! Will your children grow up to be vampires? What about your grandchildren? Will you be responsible for putting into motion their future fall? A generation of vampire children is coming to this world. In some ways, it is already here. I will explain exactly what I mean, directly.

Fathers are largely responsible for this state of affairs. And they can change it (at least in their own homes) if they would repent and trust God. But let us slow down, and lay a Biblical foundation for these claims.

I would like to call your attention to a prophecy in the Book of Malachi:

Malachi 4:5 Behold, I will send you ELIJAH THE PROPHET before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:
6 And HE SHALL TURN THE HEART OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

Elijah will come again to this earth in the Tribulation Period, right before Jesus comes to this earth to judge and reign. He will be one of the Two Witnesses in Revelation 11. He will have a "restoration" ministry. But it is important to notice the subject matter of Elijah's future sermons! ELIJAH WILL CALL FATHERS TO REPENTANCE FOR NEGLECTING THEIR CHILDREN!:

Matthew 17:11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly SHALL first come, and RESTORE all things.

There is so much that will take place in the future Tribulation Period that we are beginning to see already manifested in this age. EVERY PREACHER in this age; every man of God, should be diligently preaching in this same spirit of Elijah! We must lay again the foundations. We must restore the foundations of the fear of God (the beginning of wisdom), and the rightful place of the local church (the pillar and ground of the truth), and we must also restore the hearts of fathers back to their families. If this will be needed in the future Tribulation Period, it is likely needed in this age directly before it.

What does God want preachers to preach in these last days? Certainly, every preacher must preach the whole counsel of God, and stress the things that Scripture stresses. Yet, we can see from reading the Epistles to Timothy and Titus (especially chapter 2), that God is very interested in how FAMILIES are living. We must pause and deeply consider this important point: Elijah will come to call fathers to repentance in regard to their children. This is amazing! It teaches us something about the perilous state of things in the years to come. Can we not already see the alienation that exists between parents (especially fathers) and their children in this age?

John the Baptist came in the SPIRIT of Elijah. I believe that if more preachers had some of this same "Elijah spirit," our churches would not be in such a fallen state. I know some men who have some it, and I praise God for them:

Luke 1:13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.

16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
17 And he shall go before him IN THE SPIRIT and power of ELIAS, to TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

When God warns that He is coming, and that He will mercifully send a prophet as a warning, the very thing He brings up as wrong in the world is a BREECH or GAP between FATHERS and their children:

Ephesians 6:4 And, ye FATHERS, PROVOKE NOT YOUR CHILDREN TO WRATH: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

What we have today (and it will increase) is a generation of ANGRY kids! It is a morbid, depressed, angry generation. It is largely produced by selfish parents, who want children, the way many want a new puppy. But after the fun wears off, the kids are discarded, to be raised by themselves, by Hollywood perverts, or by the Nanny State. In contrast to this, notice the following response of Abraham to his son Isaac:

Genesis 22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, HERE AM I, MY SON...

Abraham did not make an idol out of his son, and place him before the will of God (like the later Israelites would do in Numbers 14:3). However, he also did not go to the other extreme. He was there for his son, to teach him, to guide him, to fellowship with him.

Many fathers have become shoulder-shrugging, passive, effeminate, uninvolved wimps, who could care less what their children do; or how they act. They have abandoned their children to the culture:

Genesis 35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and CHANGE YOUR GARMENTS:

3 And let us arise, and go UP TO BETHEL...
4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

Jacob had some failures. He had neglected his home. The young men had earrings in their ears (a sign of servitude on a male), and the clothes they were wearing were defiled. I believe there are many fathers today who have let the CANAANITE CULTURE infect their homes. They have passively, without a wimper, rolled over and played deaf and dumb before the antichrist culture. And the Devil has invaded their homes. Their children's toys are perverted. Their music is perverted. Their clothes are rebellious and immodest. But praise God that Jacob had somewhat of a revival! He told his family that they were going to change all their clothes, and get the earrings out of their ears, and get the wicked "gods" out of the home. He told them they were going up to Bethel (the house of God!). It is wonderful when a father firmly (though affectionately) commands his home, and guides his house BACK TO BETHEL (i.e. back to giving a true, godly, Bible-based church the place it should have in our lives).

John the Baptist, like the future Elijah, turned people to walk in the ways of God. He called disobedient fathers to repent, and walk in the wisdom of the just:

Luke 1:17...he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the wisdom OF THE JUST; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

The great preacher wanted their children to be blessed instead of cursed! A just man (in general) will have blessed children:

Proverbs 20:7 The JUST MAN walketh in his integrity: HIS CHILDREN ARE BLESSED after him.

Psalms 37:23 The steps of A GOOD MAN are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and HIS SEED IS BLESSED.

Why does the disobedient man raise CURSED children? In general, he will not search the Scriptures, and walk in the ways of God! He thinks he is wiser than the Scriptures; or he is too lazy to study them. And when the preacher studies them for him, and admonishes him, he stays out of church - or he is hardly ever there - or he simply ignores the preaching of the Word, despising the preacher. He is not a just man:

Proverbs 9:9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a JUST MAN, and he will increase in learning.

10 The FEAR OF THE LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.

What does it mean to have children who are blessed? Children that are blessed will NOT become victims of the depraved culture. They will be able to resist the foul winds of change. They will be able to be salt and light in a fallen world, without getting infected or defiled by the culture:

Psalms 1:1 BLESSED is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

Friendship with the world is enmity with God. Fathers, will your boys grow up to be BIBLE READERS? In other words, will your seed be blessed? Will they grow up to resist the rotten influences, and separate themselves from sinners? Will they be godly preachers, missionaries, or faithful servants and fellow helpers of pastors in the Lord's work? A disobedient, foolish man will not have this blessed seed! He chooses churches on the basis of "programs" instead of solid, Biblical instruction. He passively surrenders his home to the media devils of violence, lust, rebellion, and homosexuality, with the vain excuse, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."

Nine times out of ten, unless God intervenes, an unjust man will have cursed children, who will NOT walk in the counsel of the godly; they WILL be found hanging out in places where bad people are found; and their friends will be mockers and rebellious ridiculers of the ways of holiness! And notice also, cursed children will HATE the truths of the Bible. It will bore them. They will certainly not study the Scriptures daily, and they will avoid a Bible preaching church, and Bible believing people!

God has His exceptions (such as holy Josiah, whose father was wicked). Yet, in general, the just man will have blessed children; the unjust will raise cursed children:

1 Kings 22:51 Ahaziah THE SON OF AHAB began to reign over Israel in Samaria...
52 And he DID EVIL in the sight of the LORD, and WALKED IN THE WAY OF HIS FATHER, and in the way of his mother...
53 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that HIS FATHER HAD DONE.

Ahab married a wicked woman, and he raised a wicked son!:

Ezekiel 16:44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, AS IS THE MOTHER, SO IS HER DAUGHTER.

45 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children...

Wicked parents raise wicked children. Notice, wickedness in a woman is described as hating (or neglecting) her husband and children. This is why PREACHERS are called to exhort aged women to call mothers back to their homes:

Titus 2:4 [That the older women]...may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

Yet, I believe that if more men will lead the way back to the old paths, more women would follow.

Good men can get lazy or naive in certain areas; and there can be exceptions on each side, since the Lord is sovereign. But in general, good men like Abraham bring forth good men like Isaac. Notice what God says about Abraham:

Genesis 18:19 For I know him, that HE WILL COMMAND HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment...

===================================
THE COMING VAMPIRE GENERATION
===================================

But there are fathers that will not command their households. They are walking in sin themselves. They are trying to live like worldly teenagers. They are still in rebellion. And their children (even though they might have some affectionate feelings concerning them) are considered to be "in the way." These children will grow up ALIENATED and ANGRY (having been provoked to wrath). Money and fun will sometimes help to distract from the anger, but they can never be real substitutes for true love and godliness. Selfish parents will raise selfish children. And cycle will continue degenerating, until it ends in an antichrist generation of VAMPIRE CHILDREN:

Proverbs 30:11 THERE IS A GENERATION that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet IS NOT WASHED FROM THEIR FILTHINESS.
13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
14 There is a generation, WHOSE TEETH ARE AS SWORDS, and THEIR JAW TEETH AS KNIVES, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.

15 The HORSELEACH hath two daughters, CRYING, GIVE, GIVE. There are three things THAT ARE NEVER SATISFIED, yea, four things say not, It is enough:

16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.
17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.

A "horseleach" is a sort of vampire! (see vs. 14). For example, a vampire bat sucks the blood of horses. It has two razors that bite down on the victim! The leech also has two ends that it uses to attach itself, and suck the blood of horses that wade through ponds and streams:

"That here referred to...is remarkable for the coarseness of its bite, and is therefore not used for medical purposes. They are spoken of in the East with feelings of aversion and horror, because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and nostrils of horses when they come to drink out of the pools." ("Easton's Bible Dictionary") 

"Horseleach. An aquatic SUCKING WORM differing from the common leech in its larger size, and in the formation of the jaws."

("Oxford Dictionary")

The prophecy is clear! There is a VAMPIRE GENERATION that is coming! It is practically here!

Demonic vampires come from the demonology of ancient Babylon, which the Bible teaches will be revived in the last days.

It is no wonder that the sixties generation produced the GOTH GENERATION. It attempts to see beauty in destruction: Yin and Yang. They attempt to see beauty in hideous evil or darkness. Anne Rice has been an intellectual leader in this rebellious movement:

"I've always been fascinated by the [elegant] vampire...It's easy to say it's a metaphor for the outsider, the predator, anyone who feels freakish or monstrous or out of step but normal..."

(Anne Rice, quoted in "Omni Magazine," Oct., 1989)

Most have heard of the Goth or Vampire Culture from the Columbine Shootings! The liberal media played down the fact that the killers were into the Vampire culture! We were supposed to believe that it was an isolated case, and that such things as their Goth Culture (and psych-drugs) had little to do with provoking their inherent hostility and wrath.

Yet, this year, a similar outbreak occurred again in Minnesota. And, yet again, THE VAMPIRE CULTURE was present:

"A teenage high school student killed nine people, including his grandfather, and wounded more than a dozen others before turning the gun on himself in a shooting spree on the Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota on Monday...It was the deadliest incident of school-related violence since the shooting in Columbine, Colorado, that left 15 dead and 23 wounded in 1999...Students and others described Weise as a loner and 'GOTH KID' who always WORE A DARK TRENCH COAT to school. 'He's anti-social,' one student told The St. Paul Pioneer Press..." (Indianz.com, March 22, 2005)

Where was the father of this angry kid? He had selfishly committed suicide a few years before:

"Boy's father committed suicide four years ago....Wiese was described as 'a pretty bright kid, but he was lazy when it came to school. He missed a lot of school,'...'He was big into video games.' A sophomore, he enjoyed GOTH MUSIC such as performed by Marilyn Manson. 'He was constantly drawing stuff in his notebook that was EVIL AND DARK,' a source said."

("Grand Forks Herald," "Teen described as 'Goth,' 'loner'," March 22, 2005)

This is nothing but a revival of pure, ancient occultism! It is a wicked fascination with darkness, evil and BLOOD. The ancient priests of Baal, CUT THEMSELVES, and "moshed" in a circle!:

1 Kings 18:28 And they CRIED ALOUD, and CUT THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR MANNER with knives and lancets, till the BLOOD GUSHED out upon them.

 
The new "Vampire Generation," is also influenced by devils. The man that had a legion of devils, liked to hang out around the tombs! And until he found Jesus, he was naked:

Mark 5:5 ...in the tombs, CRYING, and CUTTING himself with stones.

Luke 8:27...there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and WARE NO CLOTHES, neither abode in any house, BUT IN THE TOMBS.

35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, CLOTHED, AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND: and they were afraid.

Now, let us go back to the generation of HORSELEACHES in Proverbs 30. The point is, there will one day come a final generation of BLOODSUCKING CHILDREN (Proverbs 30:15) with VAMPIRE TEETH (30:14)!

Do not miss this: This prophecy concerning the Vampire Generation contains both literal and spiritual truths. As with many things in the Bible, it contains a double teaching. For example, notice the same time of double application of literal and spiritual truths in the Book of Revelation:

Revelation 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and KEEPETH HIS GARMENTS, lest he WALK NAKED, and they see his shame.

16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

Revelation 3:18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and THAT THE SHAME OF THY NAKEDNESS DO NOT APPEAR...

In the last days, many believers will be spiritually naked (i.e. not abiding in the righteousness of Christ). They will be dressed up in psychological fables, positive thinking, etc., and will only have a form of godliness. Yet, many believers will also be LITERALLY NAKED!  In fact, many go to church dressed already in a manner that the Bible would refer to as nakedness. The news often contains reports of certain groups around the world protesting without clothes! And this depraved culture has infected Christian churches.

This type of double application prophecy is also seen in some of the fulfillments in the NT of OT prophecy. Beside the spiritual, devotional applications, we see, surprisingly, literal fulfillments (e.g. Matthew 2:15).

Therefore, the prophecy in Proverbs 30 also contains two aspects. The last days a generation OF LITERAL BLOODSUCKERS will arise! They will glorify vampirism and death! They will file and sharpen their teeth as razors! And they will suck blood like leeches! Already, public schools around the world contain children who have sharpened their teeth, or had surgical implants, to glorify the GOTH CULTURE OF VAMPIRISM.

WARNING: There will be more! Father, your own son or grandson may one day come home dressed like a vampire. He may already be listening to this evil music. One day, he may even be thrown in jail for participating in a Satanic, vampire ritual. Fathers, how far will you let things go before you wake up and TURN YOUR HEART TOWARD THE CHILDREN?

Where are the real men? Where are the Elijah's? Will someone stand up and begin to do something? The fathers are too afraid of the mothers! They don't want to offend anyone. And I will tell you the truth: If you plan on setting things straight, you will get some opposition. Not everyone will be able to see. Many will think with their emotions. They are clutching symbols of their independence. They have been taught to scream at any sign of oppression. And they are blind to the fact that the Devil and his devilish culture of sin are the real oppressors! We need some men who will stand up and NOT SPARE FOR THE CRYING. Listen to the watchmen (Jeremiah 6:16-17), who are sounding the true trumpets, and calling families back to the old paths, where there is rest! Will you wait until the children become a generation of naked, homosexual, bloodsucking cannibals before YOU WILL TAKE A STAND? Why don't you care? Man, the junk you are spending your money on is GOING TO BURN. Why don't y!

 ou do something for these children? Get back to Bethel. Change your garments. Let's teach our boys how to be men, and our girls how to be ladies.

Although there is literal truth in Proverbs 30 concerning vampires, the main point, is spiritual. The coming CURSED GENERATION will be filled with selfish, discontented, CRY-BABIES! They are spiritual vampires, preying on others; using them! They CRY "give [me], give [me]!" Just the other day, a boy shot his father because he bought ice-cream and didn't bring the kid any!

Where does the GOTH generation come from? It is the rotten fruit of the ME GENERATION! They scream out: "GIVE TO ME! I WANT MORE! Serve me, and cater to me, and do things MY way!" This is the OPPOSITE of CHARITY:

1 Corinthians 13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not...
5 ...SEEKETH NOT HER OWN, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil...

This is why "horseleech" is often used to describe a selfish person:

"Horseleach...A rapacious [i.e. dangerously greedy], insatiable [i.e. impossible to please] person."
(Oxford Dictionary)
There is coming (it is practically here) a generation of selfish, discontented, ungrateful people, who prey on others! They view their spouses as people who are there only to satisfy their whims and "needs." They are bloodsuckers, and they are never satisfied! They need a better wife or husband! They need a better church. They need a better house. They need a better "god"! They are restless and discontented:

1 Timothy 6:6 But godliness WITH CONTENTMENT is great gain.
7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

Hebrews 13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and BE CONTENT with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

Ecclesiastes 5:11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?

12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

2 Thessalonians 3:11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.

When men will not work (or they do not work enough), they become busybodies and discontented talebearers. And this brings us back to subject of fathers, and men in general. If we as fathers are USERS, and despise work, will we not raise a generation of BLOODSUCKERS, who will also prey on people and use them? If our hearts will be turned to our children, we must begin today to teach them by our example, to work, and not to use people:

"A [real] man's hands may well be able to perform delicate work...[as a musician or surgeon]. However, when the opportunity arises he does not mind getting those same hands dirty when a masculine dirty job has to be accomplished....The wimp would rather pay someone else....The wimp wants everyone else to do his dirty work....He does not want to pay for anything....He is a LEECH....He is A PARASITE who survives by sucking the life out of others....the wimp believes it is more blessed to receive than give. The wimp is a baby with a 'GIVE ME' mentality....The wimp believes that society owes him something....He often holds a grudge that people have not given him enough....The wimp lacks motivation to get off his rear end to help someone in need. He even lacks motivation to help himself....True greatness is revealed in faithful servanthood....most people that are lazy do not know it...."

(Collin Campbell, "Where are the Real Men of God?")

The children of the HORSELEACH CRY GIVE [ME]! They are selfish, discontented brats because their fathers are selfish leeches. They "may" hold down a job, yet they are not happy people:

Jude 1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds...

Notice, these USERS are preying on the charity of churches like bloodsucking leeches. They will hardly work. They still live off their mamas. And notice how they have no stability! They are carried about with every wind of lust.

 
But there is a generation that raises this generation! They did not get this way overnight! Where do BLOODSUCKING LEECHES on a horse come from? They come from another LEECH! Leeches spawn leeches! Are you listening? This antichrist generation is a selfish generation that is spawned by a former generation of men and women who did not care whether they honored the covenant of marriage. They left the children to themselves, to be raised by the culture, while they themselves sucked at the breasts of this world. Leeches come from leeches:

2 Timothy 3:2 For men shall be LOVERS OF THEIR OWN SELVES, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive SILLY WOMEN laden with sins, LED AWAY with divers lusts,

Notice the Bible stresses the two DAUGHTERS of the LEECH! They are selfish daughters, who only want to suck BLOOD! They are never satisfied.

A generation of selfish, ABSENT FATHERS produced a generation of WAYWARD, DISCONTENTED, SELFISH WOMEN, who are "led away" from homemaking, and godly femininity:

Proverbs 7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

Proverbs 5:6 ...her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.

These women are never satisfied. They cannot sit still. They are daughters of the horseleech. Many had selfish fathers who did not care about them. They were led away by the culture, to produce more leeches.

If you don't want to raise unstable, selfish, blood-sucking leeches - then begin by repenting of your own selfishness. Let's teach our children to be gracious, charitable, loving, kind, steadfast in godliness, unmovable in the ways of God! And the best way to do this is to be this way yourself!

We need strong, godly, firm, but loving, fathers in these last days that will get a burden for the family! We need men who will be strong and courageous as HORSES! Yet, many are spiritually becoming HORSELEACHES!:

Job 39:19 Hast thou given the HORSE STRENGTH? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

Fathers! Read about the WAR HORSE! He is not afraid to do battle. Are you afraid to stand up to the Devil and resist him with the spiritual weapons of God? Are you afraid to stand against this culture, and HINDER the antichrist spirit? We need men to be strong for their families in the last days:

1 Corinthians 16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you LIKE MEN, be strong.

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law CONTEND WITH THEM.

We are not in a circus. We are in a battle. And some people do not understand what all the fight is about. They don't understand the burden. They don't understand the fire God places in some men's bones and bosoms. We need men of God to stand up, and contend in love:

"...the wimp will not fight. He is afraid of danger. He lacks boldness....We have become spiritually fat and flabby..."
(Collin Campbell, "Where are the Real Men of God?")

God commanded Job to get himself ready:

Job 38:3 Gird up now thy loins LIKE A MAN; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.

An ancient man in the East might sometimes relax in a comfortable toga. But when it came time to get serious, or get to work, he would turn his toga into pants by tucking the bottom of it into his belt. I think it is tike for men to put some britches on. In other words, it is time for fathers to get involved, and to take the lead, and to get to work. Men need to nurture relationships with their children. But men are also called to watch over their families, and make sure the culture is not infecting them.

Where are the men that will be sober? Where are the fathers who will stand up and fight the satanic culture and forces, and will stand in the gap for their families? Instead of strong horses, we have too many horseleaches!

We have suckers; users; selfish manipulators, who care about no one but themselves (2 Tim. 3).

And this exactly the state of things the Devil desires. He is working overtime to produce, through the culture, a generation of passive men, who will be uninvolved, who will live to party, who will wear flowered-shirts, and will be slaves to pornography.

This is why the media is telling us that the traditional ideal-man is an endangered species!:

"Most ads have lumped men into one of two groups - the soft, caring type known as 'metrosexuals,' who are comfortable with facial peels and pink shirts, or the stereotypical 'retrosexuals,' who remain oafishly addicted to beer and sports. 'As the world is drifting toward a more feminine perspective, many of the social constructs men have taken for granted are undergoing significant shifts or being outright dismantled,' said Tom Bernardin, chairman and chief executive of Leo Burnett Worldwide....When asked which they would prefer, a higher standard of living with them staying home with the kids while the wife worked or a lower standard of living with them working and the wife staying home, 46 percent said THEY'D PREFER TO STAY HOME...." (Reuters, June 24, 2005)

"Macho man is an endangered species, with today's male MORE LIKELY TO OPT FOR A PINK FLOWERED SHIRT and swingers' clubs than THE TRADITIONAL ROLE AS FAMILY SUPER-HERO, fashion industry insiders say....'The masculine ideal is being completely modified. All the TRADITIONAL MALE values of AUTHORITY, infallibility, virility and STRENGTH are being completely overturned,' said Pierre Francois Le Louet, the agency's managing director. Instead TODAY'S MALES are turning more towards 'creativity, sensitivity and multiplicity,' as seen already in recent seasons on the catwalks of Paris and Milan....the 21st-century man who 'no longer wants to be the family super-hero'....Why not put on a pink-flowered shirt and try out a partner-swapping club?' asked Le Louet....'He is looking for a more radical affirmation of who he is, and wants to test out all the barbarity of modern life'...Reebok with its 'I am what I am' campaign had perfectly tapped into this current trend...."

("Agency France Press," 2005)

This is Crowleyite rebellion. It is "do what thou wilt." Fashion almost always has an agenda; a lifestyle change that goes with the new trend. The metro man or hybrid man is all about selling homo or bi-sexuality!

Notice, they are against the traditional role of the father as the "super-hero" of the family. This may not be the best language, but the idea behind it is not far from the Biblical ideal:

Proverbs 17:6 ...the GLORY of children are their FATHERS.

Therefore, the new "21st-century man" is out of step with God if he is not interested in being, in one sense, the glory of his children.

But where is this glory? It is indeed fading away! But the need is still here! Too many kids are growing up confused and betrayed; as victims of a rotten culture. They do not need spoiling. They do not need just a buddy! They need a FATHER who will perform the role of training them. There is ICHABOD being written over many homes. The glory has departed from the family.

Let's put God (the true glory) back into the home. And when He is obeyed, the fathers will turn their hearts to their children, and quit being passive. The world's new man may where a flowery shirt - but he will burn in hell-fire if he doesn't repent.

(Sermon preached 6-19-05, by Joey Faust; edited for reading)

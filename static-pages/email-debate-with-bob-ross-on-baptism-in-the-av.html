        <h1>EMAIL DEBATE WITH BOB ROSS ON BAPTISM IN THE AV</h1>
        <div id="content">
            ************************************************************************

AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH BOB ROSS OF PILGRIM PUBLICATIONS IN RESPONSE TO: "OUR BAPTIST BIBLE: PROOF THAT THE AV TRANSLATORS DID NOT TRY TO HIDE THE MEANING OF THE GREEK WHEN USING THE WORD 'BAPTISM'"

************************************************************************

ROSS: "The Pedobaptists have capitalized on this transliterated word for hundreds of years, using it to pull the wool over peoples' eyes in regard to the meaning of Greek word. It would be a betrayal of our Baptist forefathers to yield to them at this time, knowing as much as we do. Perhaps the greatest deception ever fostered on Christianity is infant baptism, and it could have been more effectively exposed with a proper translation in the KJV."

=======================================================

FAUST: "It is not historically true that they have used this word. First, until the middle of the 17th century, the majority of Pedobaptists DIPPED babies, unless they were sick. Secondly, even in the 19th century, Pedobaptists have argued that they know the earliest Christians immersed, and that this is the best meaning of the word. They rather argue on the basis of the form supposedly being a minor issue, and one that can be altered at whim. I have proven that 'baptism' was a proper translation, since it was a well known English word meaning to immerse at the time. Those who you claim have somehow capitalized on the later adopted changes in meaning (after 1611), would have also capitalized on ANY word that had been used. If they changed 'baptize' they would have changed any other word. For example, even the word DIP is defined by Webster in 1843 as: 'To moisten; to wet.' Thus, even the word 'DIP' would have been used to teach sprinkling by those looking for an excuse in a definition. But the real point here is that another fable has been exposed, and there are some folks that need to admit it, by the Lord's grace."

=======================================================

ROSS: "'I have proven that 'baptism' was a proper translation, since it was a well known English word meaning to immerse at the time.' Yeah, I have some acquaintences who believe Benny Hinn performs miracles."

=======================================================

FAUST: "Is that statement your scholarly answer to the research? With such a response, I would suppose that you have some great historical information that will refute these good Baptist historians that have proven that baptism was an English word that means to immerse in 1607-1611. But what you do not say is as telling as what you do say. And this argues that the issue all along is not an intellectual one, but a heart problem. Otherwise, you would have said, 'Thank you for the information; I never knew that,' and you would have proceeded to another alleged error, or you would have given up your views. But let the record be established by your response here, before man and God.

=======================================================

ROSS: 'But the real point here is...' ...that King James dictated that the Greek word would not be translated, but they would use the 'ecclesiastical' word as in the Latin Vulgate. Did I ever send you Ruckman's article in which he shows how 'baptize' came to England in the Latin Vulgate?"

=======================================================

FAUST: "Where it came from and whether or not it was an ecclesiastical word are NOT the issues - for the simple fact that the 'ecclesiastical' word had an ESTABLISHED MEANING as DIPPING. To my former article, the following facts may be added:

1.The word baptism had been an English word for centuries. Bede (700 A.D.) held that baptism meant immersion.

2. In the time of Queen Mary (1553-1558), the raging Catholic, only IMMERSION was allowed!

3. King James believed that 'baptism' meant immersion and rejected any other mode (see J.M. Pendleton, 'Baptist Church Manual').

4. All BAPTIST Confessions of Faith used the word 'baptism' prior to 1611.

Concerning the testimony of the AV Translators, where they write that, 'We have on the one side avoided the scrupulosity of the Puritans who leave the old ecclesiastical words, as when they put washing for baptism...', it is clear from history that some of these Puritans wanted 'washing' instead of 'baptism' because some of them were beginning to embrace 'sprinkling':

'The form of the Puritans was pouring; the form of the Baptists was immersion.' (Christian)

...Some of the Puritans wanted the word 'washing' to be used in every context. But the AV Translators rejected this as a constant translation, and used the ESTABLISHED word for immersion everywhere the religious ordinance is referred to. It is therefore ABSOLUTELY proven that King James and the AV Translators, instead of trying to sneak in SPRINKLING, were actually, if anything, trying to hinder its adoption! Again, this is why all Baptists before 1611 used the word 'baptism' in their confessions and translations (see Tyndale), and why the Baptists after 1611 used the AV, and boldly reproved anyone who thought to CHANGE it!

=======================================================

ROSS: 'I have proven that 'baptism' was a proper translation, since it was a well known English word meaning to immerse at the time.' Ruckman claims that 'baptize' got to England in the Latin Vulgate brough by Augustine, the monk, who in 597 is said to have baptized several thousands by sprinkling. (History, I:206)."

=======================================================

FAUST: "If he said that he is wrong there. It got in the Latin (and then in the Vulgate) through Tertullian.

=======================================================

ROSS: "The only issue is the fact that 'baptize' was used in the KJV because the King dictated that it be used."

=======================================================

FAUST: "Oh yes, and it was so he could make sure everyone was sprinkled, right? All we can see dear brother is that you are not able to handle the evidence presented, and you are unwilling to be honest about it."

=======================================================

ROSS: Peter S. Ruckman tells you how 'baptize' got to England: RUCKMAN EXPOSES WHAT EVANS CALLS THE 'BLACK HELICOPTER CONSPIRACY'....The words 'black helicopter, Catholic conspiracy' is the way Evans tries to discount the historical facts behind use of the word 'baptize' in the King James Bible and other Pedobaptist and Roman Catholic translations, as presented by Peter S. Ruckman in his "Church History" publication. But if Herb Evans had only read Ruckman's 'History' and a few other writings by 'Possel' Peter Ruckman, he could have easily found this 'conspiracy' exposed by Ruckman. Surely, Evans would accept what Possel presents. In fact, Possel refers to 'the POPE'S UNDERCOVER AGENT' who was largely responsible for the infiltration of 'baptize' into the language of the English speaking 'church.' (The History of the New Testament Church, Vol. I, page 262). That 'agent' is exposed by Possel as being a Benedictine monk by the name of 'Augustine' whom Possel reveals was later appointed by Rome as the Archbishop of Canterbury....It is clear from Possel Ruckman's History and his other writings that the transliterated word 'baptize,' which is in all Pedobaptist Bibles, including the Pedobaptist 'Church of England's' King James Bible...Possel Ruckman reveals that Augustine brought 'baptize' to England after it had been somehow brought forth by those of the 'Alexandrian Cult' down in Egypt. Centuries after being brought to England, the word 'baptize' eventually became creedally authenticated by the Roman Catholic Council of Trent as 'sacred,' and it was officially declared by the Roman Catholic Church that 'no one is to dare, or presume to reject it under any pretext whatever,' and the Council of Trent proclaimed that it has been 'preserved in the Catholic Church by a continued succession' by means of Rome's Latin Vulgate Bible (Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, Fourth Session). In due time, this transliterated word would also be regarded by the 'King James Only' group as part of the 'preserved Word of God,' in support of the Council of Trent's dogma. Possel says that Rome's Vulgate Bible is the 'ALEXANDRIAN Bible' (History, I:162, 173, 177, 195), and he alleges that 'God will send nothing through Rome but corruption; absolutely nothing' (ibid, I:180). 'Jerome came out with the Alexandrian Bible,' says Possel, referring to the Vulgate (ibid, page 173). Possel affirms that ST. JEROME was the creator of the Latin Vulgate Bible, the Roman Catholic Bible, and 'baptize' was in the copies of that Bible, which the POPE sent to England by Augustine the monk, the Pope's 'undercover agent,' according to Ruckman's history (History, I:206). This was 596 A. D., and in 597 the Benedictine monk 'SPRINKLED about ten thousand' at Christmastime, according to Possel (ibid), using the Latin Vulgate's word 'baptize' in reference to sprinkling. By this means, the meaning of 'baptize' was physically exhibited and this 'mode' became 'established' in the English mind, according to Possel's assistant Larry Vance (Bible Believers Bulletin, 7/95, page 17)....This deliberate lack of translating the word made it possible to 'define' the word to the ignorant and unlearned masses as having a 'meaning' other than what the Greek word actually means. And very few of those who knew the difference dared to stand up against the authority of the Pope and the Roman Church, so 'baptize' became the common word to refer to sprinkling. It was even established in the official English dictionaries, such as the Oxford English Dictionary....Was it a "Black Helicopter Conspiracy" fraud which is outlined by Possel Ruckman in his writings, or is he telling the truth? Since he is an

'ex-Catholic,' and had training from a Jesuit priest, it seems likely he would perhaps have legit 'inside' information on this, as he has presented." [Faust: I have deleted portions of Ruckman's alleged history here to save space, since he responded with an entire article found on his web site.]
=======================================================

FAUST: "Are you saying that you believe Ruckman on this issue?"

=======================================================

ROSS: "Why is it that when one differs with a KJVO, they are accused of dishonesty? Did King James dictate the use of 'baptize' or not? If he did, why do you accuse me of being dishonest?"

=======================================================

FAUST: You are not responding to the evidence that was given, and that is why you are not being honest. You have not answered the proofs given that baptize, as an 'OLD, ecclesiastical word' meant immerse at the time of James. Therefore, if he 'dictated' anything, he dictated that the word be not changed to washing so sprinkling would be supported.

=======================================================

ROSS: "I do believe that 'baptize' most likely made its way to England via the Latin Vulgate Bible. It was a word 'created' in the Latin language, transliterating from Greek. So how else could it have come into England but by those who used Latin?"

=======================================================

FAUST:

"1. What you apparently missed was that it entered the old Latin through Tertullian who understood immersion (like all the early Christians, until the perversion into sprinkling arose in FRANCE). And this is why the word meant immersion in English until the time of Westminster Confession.

2. Besides, Jerome (i.e. Latin Vulgate!) believed the word baptism referred to IMMERSION:

'Remember the day on which you enlisted, when, BURIED with Christ in BAPTISM, you swore fealty to Him...'

'We shall see the fountain in which the eunuch was IMMERSED by Philip...'

'The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His BAPTIMAL IMMERSION He has cleansed the Jordan...'

'If it were possible for us to be always IMMERSED in the waters of baptism, sins would fly over our heads and leave us untouched.'

'And thrice we are IMMERSED, that there may appear one sacrament of the Trinity.'

=======================================================

ROSS: "No one ever disputed that the word meant immerse, but that was not the exclusive 'meaning,' as I have shown in recent emails with Evans, etc. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as immerse, sprinkle, and pour."

=======================================================

FAUST: "The Oxford Dictionary was written long after the era of King James. What we are debating is what the word meant at the time of King James. What king dictated to Tyndale (who believed in immersion) to use the word 'baptism' is his writings and version?"

=======================================================

ROSS: "Are you alleging that 'baptize' was not used in England before King James to refer to something besides immersion?"

=======================================================

FAUST: "In early England, and especially in the time period of the AV, 'baptism' was a common English word that meant to dip or immerse. I have provided the evidence for the meaning of the word at the time. Present your evidence to the contrary."

=======================================================

ROSS: "I noticed in Schaff's Creeds, Vol. 3, page 521, a footnote indicates that in 1604 the Anglican Cathecism referred to 'the person baptized is dipped or sprinkled,' and was changed in 1661 to 'baptized.' I sell a booklet in the store by R. A. Venable who claims that sprinkling or pouring started with the baptism of Novation in the third century. If so, then I assume that the act of sprinkling or pouring was called 'baptism' back then."

=======================================================

FAUST: "Calvin (concerning the meaning of the word), the Waldenses, the Catholics in the Middle Ages, the Eastern Greeks, and ESPECIALLY THE ENGLISH (until Westminster) held that 'baptism' meant immersion, and they practiced it so.  In England, Ussher says that immersion was the mode. The Prayer Book elsewhere actually says the child should be DIPPED, UNLESS SICK and then he may be sprinkled, etc. Therefore the exception of sprinkling concerns a sick child. The word 'washing' was rejected by the AV Translators, and the common word for immersion was retained (as used in all early versions, court documents [see Hampton Court], liturgies, etc., and it always meant dip UNLESS it was referring to a special case. Baby dippers from the first few centuries who made the exception of pouring when sick, doubted that such should still be called baptism. Even Rome, when it later fell into sprinkling, argued against Baptists by admitting the meaning of the word, and saying none deny it. Therefore, the fable that the AV Translators or king wanted to adopt sprinkling is simply an unlearned claim that has been repeated until people started to believe it because it sounded good. The hyper-Calvinists, along with the Geneva version (which used 'washings' and justified sprinkling or pouring, since Calvin said that although the word means dipping, it is not important) were despised by King James. And they would not gain an upper hand until decades later AFTER he had died."

=======================================================

ROSS: "You did not say whether or not 'baptize' was used of sprinkling or pouring as far back - according to Venable - as the case of Novation. Likewise, I referred you to the Anglican  Cathecism (1604) which referred to 'the person baptized is dipped or sprinkled,' showing that 'baptize' was a word signifying more than one 'mode' to the English. You have presented no evidence that 'baptize' was exclusively used of dipping or immersion. Also, even the KJV translates the Greek words with 'wash,' 'washed,' 'washing,' 'washings,' 'dip,' and 'dipped,' which shows they obviously knew what the Greek words meant, but on the matter of immersion ('baptism') by the King's command they reverted to the Latin Vulgate's 'old ecclesiastical word' which had been applied over the years since the introduction of sprinkling and pouring to all 'modes' of 'baptism.'"

=======================================================

FAUST: I have been attending a conference this week, and have had to answer you without providing quotes. I will [now] try to provide some documentation for you here.

'Baptize' is an Anglicized word adopted directly from baptizein (Greek). It means whatever the Greek word means. And there is abundant literature in Greek, as well as lexicons and quotes AT THE TIME OF THE AV TRANSLATORS to show what the word means/meant. Even as late as 1687, Gabriel Towerson wrote:

'..as is evident from the NATIVE SIGNIFICANCE of the word 'baptism,' which signifies an IMMERSION or dipping into some liquid thing.'

Any who departed from the proper meaning by sprinkling or pouring did not justify their perversion on the basis of the etymology of the word in Greek or English. In fact, the opponents of dipping confessed that that the word means to dip or plunge!

Actually, the word 'baptize' was the best word to use in English, not just for its reverent tone, but also for its meaning. First, the word is plainly defined by the Bible as a burial and resurrection (Rom. 6, etc.). Therefore, anyone with an English Bible can discern the meaning (add to this the phrases concerning going down into the water and coming out, etc.). Secondly, we have already mentioned the abundance of Greek literature, versions, etc., where the word is used, along with older lexicons, etc. Greek is useful here since the etymology of the word is plainly seen to be derived from the Greek. Thirdly, the word 'immerse' does not completely describe the fact that the baptism is not a leaving under the water (forever submerged) since the word does not ALWAYS have to imply a raising up again (like dip or plunge, etc.). 'Immerse' is a good word when taken in its primary sense. But it does not always have the meaning of dip. 'Baptize' is the best word, and the one that suited that 'sect' (already called Baptists) the best! Baptists baptize with Baptist baptisms!

Now as to your Catechism that you mention in 1604: This was part of the Common Prayer Book. Notice what this Prayer Book commanded:

The First English Book of Common Prayer (Edward VI, 1549):

'Then the priest shall take the child in his hands, and ask the name. And naming the child, SHALL DIP IT IN THE WATER thrice...The third time DIPPING the face toward the font: So it be discreetly and warily done, saying. N. I BAPTIZE thee...AND IF THE CHILD BE WEAK, IT SHALL SUFFICE TO POUR WATER UPON IT...'

The Second Book of Common Prayer (King Edward VI, 1552), and also the First Book of Queen Elizabeth (1559), and that of KING JAMES (1604) called The Hampton Court Book (Pickering's Facsimile):

'Then the priest shall take the child in his hands, and ask the name, and naming the child shall DIP IT IN THE WATER, so it be discreetly and warily done, saying. '[Name] I BAPTIZE thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.' AND IF THE CHILD BE WEAK, IT SHALL SUFFICE TO POUR WATER UPON IT...'

The 'sprinkling' option in the 1604 edition in the catechism refers to an EXCEPTION, contrary to the regular understood meaning of the word:

Archbishop Usher: '...and our church allows no other [BUT DIPPING], EXCEPT in case of the child's weakness; and therein is expressed our Saviour's baptism, both the descending INTO the water, and the rising up."

Bishop Taylor (1613-1677), Church of England, The Rule of Conscience:

'...the custom of the ancient churches was not sprinkling, but immersion, in pursuance of the sense of the word in the commandment...And this is the sense and law of the church of England; not that it be indifferent, but that all infants BE DIPPED, EXCEPT in case of sickness, and then SPRINKLING is permitted.'

Conybeare and Howson (Church of England):

'It is needless to add, that baptism was (unless in EXCEPTIONAL cases) administered by immersion, the convert being plunged beneath the surface of the water to represent his death to the life of sin, and then raised from this momentary burial to represent his resurrection to the life of righteousness.'

This had always been the understanding of the Church of England:

Canon of the Council of Cachuth, A.D. 816:

'Let the presbyters also know, when they administer the holy BAPTISM, that they MAY NOT POUR the holy water over the infants' heads, but let them ALWAYS BE IMMERSED IN THE FONT; as the Son of God furnished by Himself an example to every believer, when He was thrice immersed in the waves of the Jordan.'

Tyndale's 'Obedience of a Christian Man' (1571 edition):

'The plunging into the water signifieth that we die, and are buried with Christ, as concerning the old life of sin which is Adam. And the pulling out again, signifieth that we rise again with Christ in a new life full of the Holy Ghost...Rom. VI.'

J. Lingard, 'History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church' (Vol. I., p. 317):

'The regular manner of administering it was BY IMMERSION...the place a baptistery...in which had been constructed a convenient bath called a font. When an adult solicited baptism, he was called upon to profess his belief in the true God, by the repetition of the Lord's Prayer, and the Apostles' creed; and to declare his intention of leading a good life of piety, by making a threefold renunciation of the devil, his works and his pomps. He then DESCENDED into the font; the priest depressed his head three times BELOW the surface, saying I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost...In the baptism of children the same rites were observed, with a few necessary variations...Each child was successively delivered undressed into his hands, and he PLUNGED it thrice into the water...'

Brenner (a Roman Catholic historian) writes:

'Thirteen hundred years was baptism generally and regularly an immersion of the person under water, and ONLY IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES a sprinkling or pouring with water; the latter was, moreover, disputed as a mode of baptism, nay even forbidden.'

Pope Gregory I (Order of Sacraments), states:

'Then let the priest baptize with a trine IMMERSION...'

Jerome (Com. On Eph.), writes:

'And thrice we are IMMERSED...'

(Conant, 1864)

As to Novation:

'About the year 251 A.D., Eusebuis informs us that one Novation, being ON A SICK BED, desired to be baptized. But he was thought too weak to be taken to the water, and so it was arranged to put A GREAT QUANTITY OF WATER upon him as he lay upon his bed, as the NEAREST POSSIBLE APRROACH to baptism under the circumstances.'
(Wilson, 'History of Sprinkling')

Conclusion:

Since those who sprinkle do not base their arguments on the word 'baptism,' it therefore follows that if the AV had used 'immerse,' it would have not stopped the practice of sprinkling. 'Immersion' would have simply become a religious, sacramental word that would have soon been defined by some dictionaries as 'a religious act of sprinkling by some churches.'

Now it is also important to realize how this all began: Anti-AV teachers spread abroad the FABLE that since Church of England always SPRINKLED (especially at the time of King James), that this is why they used the word 'baptize.' This fable has now been exposed. Anti-Av teachers must now say:

'Although baptism always meant 'dipping' throughout history, except in cases of sickness (and even then it was debated whether this could be called 'baptism'), and although the era of King James certainly dipped (except in cases of sickness), it appears that King James (who himself used the word 'baptism' in a speech to mean to plunge), was inclined to hinder the Geneva Calvinists (who were inclined to the word 'washings' so they could justify pouring), so the AV Translators used the word that had been used by Tyndale and all previous English versions, and Baptists, that was defined in the Greek lexicons of the day to mean 'dipping.' But in spite of all this, we think the word should have been 'immerse.'

Well think whatever you desire. But as Baptist, along with the Baptists before King James, the Baptists at the time of King James, and the Baptists after King James, I happen to think that the word 'baptism' was the grandest, safest, purest English word to use. And instead of hindering the Baptists, they multiplied! And instead of the opponents of immersion using the word baptism in its proper meaning as an argument, THEY FLEE from such an argument! This shows that the word baptism - as it is linked to history and the Greek, openly displayed in context in the Scriptures, is so powerfully against sprinkling that the opponents will not dare argue its meaning.

It is time for you to move on to another criticism, such as the word 'church,' or something. Any honest reader of these exchanges would be able to see that 'your ship has been baptized' on this issue - not by my skills, but by the true facts of history."

=======================================================

ROSS: "Joey, if you will go back to my original question, you will see that 'baptism' was not even the subject matter. Nevertheless, all of your quotations are fine, at least coming from those whom you quote, but some folks back before the KJV obviously  thought that 'baptize' also applied to pouring or sprinkling, too. Usage of the word even covered the 'exception' you mention. The usage was as if 'baptism' was a ceremonial, ritual name, not a word indicative of the specific method. If the King wanted to offset the Puritans, he could have ordered 'dip' or 'immerse,' but he chose the old Latin Vulgate word which was known to be an inclusive word for all supposed 'modes' for the 'rite' of 'baptism.' I am sorry, but your case for the exclusivity of the usage of 'baptize' to apply to immersion does not stand. It was in the Vulgate, and brought to England in that Bible long before the KJV, and became the common word in England usage for all 'modes' of baptism."

=======================================================

FAUST: "The more you respond without saying anything, the deeper you dig your hole on this issue. You write:

'If the King wanted to offset the Puritans, he could have ordered 'dip' or 'immerse,' but he chose the old Latin Vulgate word which was known to be an inclusive word for all supposed 'modes' for the 'rite' of 'baptism.'  

Please document any historical quote where you can show that someone interpreted 'baptism' as an 'inclusive word.' What you are giving is your own assumptions. But I provided you with the conclusions that were drawn by people in that day. I quoted Jerome to you, who wrote the Vulgate, who believed that baptism meant TRINE IMMERSION! Those who believed that baptism applied to sprinkling believed it was an EXCEPTION FOR THE SICK â€“ and NOT THE MEANING OF THE WORD! Show me anyone who wrote that 'baptism' (the word) meant anything other than dipping. No one in that day would have written that the exception for the sick proved that the word meant sprinkling! Even those in France, etc. (or the followers of Calvin), always conceded that the word MEANS dipping. If there was an attempt for anyone to endorse sprinkling as primary mode, then they would have tried to do it under the word WASHING when referring to the ordinance. And this is the very thing that the king CHECKED. Now I have already told you that any word, if it ever became the major word for the ordinance in English, would have ended up being defined by all modes of baptism, since dictionary writers often tell you how a word is used, not always simply what it means. And I have showed you where the word 'dip' sometimes means just 'to wet' in English.

P.S. You did bring up baptism when you accused the AV of error. And I am glad you did. Do you have anything else you would like to bring up? But you still have not answered my questions about the Canon. Stay warm. It is freezing here in DFW."

=======================================================

ROSS: "No one disputes that baptize has always referred to the Greek word, which means immersion. But sprinkling was added in about the 3rd century, then officially endorsed by the Council of Ravenna later on, obviously after being so widely accepted as being 'baptizm' in addition to immersion. When Romanism came to England, it was common for sprinkling to be regarded as baptism as much as Romanism. There a lot of sources on the Internet which will give you more information. I do not get paid to educate you on something which you probably already know, but due to your being wed to your hobbyhorse, you just refuse to acknowledge the truth. Ruckman has acknowledged it, and Ruckman says he is a 'genius' and has a degree from Bob Jones University. Why do you stand on your head and try to see historic truth so differently, all for the sake of defending your hobbyhorse?"

=======================================================

FAUST: 'When Romanism came to England, it was common for sprinkling to be regarded as baptism as much as Romanism.'

The above line is baloney, pure and simple. I proved it, by showing that in England, the mode of baptism under Rome was immersion - by law!  Sprinkling was 'allowed' first in France, but it did not spread to England until after King James:

'The Sarum Manuele (the guide to ritual practice at the Salisbury Cathedral), received its definitive form by the mid-thirteenth century and served as the most widely used ritual order in England. It specified immersion as the mode of baptism, although sprinkling was allowed in exceptional cases. Its influence is clearly noted in the first Book of Common Prayer (1549), composed by Thomas Cranmer, defining the new liturgical structure of the king's church for England, and, regarding baptism, maintaining the traditional preference for immersion, in this case trine immersion...In the 1552 edition, trine baptism is abandoned to include only single immersion...FOR ENGLISH CATHOLICS, THE EMPHASIS ON IMMERSION as expressed in the Sarum Rite was replaced by the Rituale Romanum IN 1614, which prescribed baptism by pouring...In some regions, notably Poland and ENGLAND [immersion]...was far more than just a legacy...a renewed recognition of the Greek 'baptizein' LED OBVIOUSLY TO A LITERAL APPLICATION...scriptural descriptions of baptism, both in its literal application as well as in its symbolic explanations, confirmed immersion as the apostolic mode...'

You will never prove your fable below for the same reasons you will not answer why Hermas should not be in the Canon, etc. (it shouldn't):

'When Romanism came to England, it was common for sprinkling to be regarded as baptism as much as Romanism.'

This is why Bloody Mary outlawed sprinkling, right?

Most of my books are boxed up as I change offices, so I do not have Ruckman's book before me. But if he said what you say he said, he is wrong, just like you. If you call rebuking fables a hobbyhorse, so be it. But I would rather ride that horse than rest upon a fable. And your claims about King James and baptism in England is a historical fable. Thanks for the correspondence documenting from the horse's mouth that there is no support for this fable, and showing that the fable cannot be defended."

=======================================================

ROSS: "Joey, you are one extreme, and there is another extreme which argues that the Bible teaches sprinkling for baptism. http://www.all-of-grace.org/pub/others/baptism.html

Since these 'sprinklings' of the Old Testament are called 'baptisms' in the Greek of Hebrews 9:10, God has Himself prescribed how He wishes baptisms to be performed: by sprinkling. It makes no difference what the classical definitions of baptizo may be; what Bible students want to know is: 'How does the Bible define it, and does Bible usage confirm this definition?' Abundant confirmation in Bible usage of the definition of baptizo in Hebrews 9:10 may be found in the Bible. As illustrations, let us look first at some synonyms of baptism and then at some examples of water baptism, all, of course, taken from the Bible. Water Baptism Must Be by Sprinkling - Furthermore, the translators of the King James Version recognized no implication of immersion in the English preposition used. Almost all, if not every one, of the translators were affusionists. The idea that immersion is established or even supported by these English prepositions has grown up through a study of the English version and a neglect of the Greek original.'"
=======================================================
FAUST: "Thanks Bob for the quote. Notice what it says: 'The idea that immersion is established or even supported by these English prepositions has grown up through A STUDY OF THE ENGLISH VERSION and a neglect of the Greek original.' But this fellow is simply reading MODERN Anglican theology back into early Anglican theology, with no awareness that there have been significant changes. If he would have checked some history, he would have seen that sprinkling was not adopted until after the AV was printed. He probably did a quick search and found the many articles by anti-AV teachers who have repeated this fable over and over again. Now this man has an interesting position. First, he knows better than to argue the meaning of the word baptism: 'It makes no difference what the classical definitions of baptizo may be...' He rather chooses to argue CONTEXT and usage in Scripture. But there is major roadblock in his way when he goes to examine usage and context. What is it? IT IS THE AV and the way it uses 'into the water,' 'down,' etc. So he blames the AV for immersion!"
=======================================================
ROSS: "This is from another website:http://www.wayoflife.org/articles/dip02.htm
Take for example John Fox's testimony in his Book of Martyrs, published in 1562:
'There are some Anabaptists at this time in England who came from Germany. Of these there were two sorts; the first only objected to the baptising of children and to the manner of it by sprinkling instead of dipping.' This evidently means that some were practicing sprinkling for baptism before the AV."
=======================================================
FAUST: "Foxe's quote does not say that these Baptists found sprinkling IN ENGLAND at this time (unless they objected to the exception clause for the sick). It has already been shown that France had adopted sprinkling, but not England. At this time, England immersed babies."

ROSS: "How strange! that a 'perfect' translation of the Bible should be so soon followed by the advent of other 'modes' of baptism!"

FAUST: "Not too strange when we realize that they did not justify their new mode on the word 'baptism,' but instead admitted the true meaning, but argued on the basis of the ordinance being a light issue (such as whether to have the Lord's Supper at night, like a 'supper,' or in the morning, etc). Also, it is not strange when we then see the Lord, for the first time in ages, bring Baptists out of hiding, and founding the US with the AV, where 'Baptists' (not 'Dippers') would grow to become, for a time, the largest group of Christians."

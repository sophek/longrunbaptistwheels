            NEWS

I met some dear folks in New Jersey, with Pastor Gordon Parks. Thank you for your prayers for his conference. I look forward to giving more information about this trip in the future. One of the black preachers (Robert E. Smith) gave a rousing, controversial sermon on why the African American community should not vote for Obama, since he endorses baby-killing (abortion), a majority of which are black babies. The kingdom-seed has taken root in diverse areas, and I am thankful for every believer who hopes for the prize of reigning with Christ in the Millennium, and is not ashamed of the Lord's warnings to disciples.
I will be preaching at Crown of Life Baptist Church in Indiana, with Brother Dzula this weekend. Pray for his inner-city work, and for the UBF conference I will be attending.

Also, in a few weeks, I will be preaching at the following 'kingdom/overcomer's" conference:
Faith Baptist Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee
Pastor Tracey Daniels
Nov. 2nd-5th, 2008
Phone: 423-344-7610
Your prayers for this event is greatly appreciated! If you are near, please try to attend.
 
THE FEMINIST VIEW OF DEBORAH 
(By Pastor Joey Faust)
When faced with the Biblical commands for mothers to "guide the house" and be "keepers at home" (1Timothy 5:14, Titus 2:5) it is common to be faced with questions concerning Deborah in the Book of Judges. Since the Scriptures cannot be broken (and they do not contradict), it is crucial that we have a proper, Biblical view of Deborah. Many attempt to use Deborah to justify working mothers, women pastors or female presidents of nations. Some understand the occult ramifications of these controversies, and they use Deborah to usher in the coming, Satanic age of feminism. They see the history of Deborah as one of the only good "stories" in the Holy Scriptures. 

Many imply that if Deborah can be shown to have ruled over civil affairs in the nation of Israel, there is no need to apply the New Testament commands in Titus 2:5, etc., to modern mothers - at least not to mothers who desire to become mayors, governors, vice presidents, presidents, etc. However, the Scriptures teach that if Christian mothers forsake their homes for careers, it will cause the Bible and the cause of Christ to be blasphemed by lost people who, with the light of nature, know that such behavior is "against nature" (Romans 2:14, 1 Corinthians 11:14). Natural affection (like spiritual love) is not measured in word only, but also in deed (1 John 3:18). The Bible warns that in the last days many will not endure sound doctrine (2 Timothy 4:3); and "sound doctrine," as shown in Titus 2:1,5, includes mothers being keepers at home. We are also warned that in the last days evil men will seduce many women to be "led away," on the basis of their lusts and selfish goals, from their "houses"!:
 
2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves...
3 Without natural affection...
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
6 For of this sort are they which creep into HOUSES, and lead captive SILLY WOMEN laden with sins, LED AWAY with divers lusts, 

As seen with Eve in Genesis 3, feminine lusts often have more to do with power and position (leaving one's place, usurping authority, etc.) than with fornication or adultery. We can therefore be almost certain that the perilous deception of women in the last days (2 Timothy 3:6) will include forsaking her home and God-ordained calling for masculine power, work, etc. This will produce disobedient children (2 Timothy 3:2, Proverbs 29:15, 7:11, etc.) to her shame, and will bring further reproach upon Christianity.
 
It is common knowledge that there has been some reawakening to the responsibilities of motherhood by the post-feminist generation. Even secular magazines refer to it (e.g. see the cover title of the current issue of Philadelphia Magazine). For this reason, Satan is working overtime (with his characteristic subtlety) to defend and further the ancient, feminist dream of occultists. He will use feminism temporarily before he ultimately demands outright worship of himself. Feminism has always been blatantly rooted in occultism. 
One of the first feminists of modern times was Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She was the leader of the first women's rights convention in 1848. As a friend of the infidel Ingersoll, she later blasphemed God and the Bible in her commentary of the Scriptures called, "The Woman's Bible" (1898). The Theosophical (occult) ideas of Madame Blavatsky are manifest throughout her commentary (which she authored with other feminists). She redefined the Trinity as Father, Mother and Son. Although she married, she would not vow to submit to her husband, and she was a grief and shame to him her whole life.

Matilda Gage formed the National Liberal Union, and wrote, "Woman, Church and State," in 1893. She argued that the Bible must be removed, and Biblical churches chained from influencing the state, if women were to ever gain authority with men.

Likewise, Annie Besant (the leader of the English suffragist cause) was a leader in occult Theosophy and friend of the infamous Satanist and pervert, Aleister Crowley. 

Many in recent times have become familiar with the blasphemous views of feminist Margaret Sanger (of Planned Parenthood and Nazi eugenics fame). 

Even Susan B. Anthony defended the blasphemies of Elizabeth Cady Stanton against the Bible, and reasoned that Stanton was likely correct in her view of the best way to promote feminism. Stanton reasoned that until the Bible was seen as only a crude book of primitive stories, and a new "Bible" written, there would be no lasting change. The views of Stanton (defended by Anthony) can be seen in the following quotes from Stanton's "Woman's Bible":

"Come, come, my conservative friend, wipe the dew off your spectacles, and see that the world is moving...Some, having made a fetish of these [Bible] books...[believe] them to be the veritable 'Word of God'..."

Stanton's blasphemies are one of the main roots of the common, feminist interpretations of the Pauline Epistles. She writes:

"The church at Corinth was peculiarly given to diversion and disputation; and women were apt to join in...hence they were advised to consult their husbands at home."
(Stanton, "The Woman's Bible," 1898)

She erroneously argues that the commands in Corinth are due to special circumstances in that church alone. But the Holy Ghost, foreseeing the objection, guards against it by applying the prohibition to "churches" (plural) in 1 Corinthians 14:33-34, 36. Paul even teaches that the prohibitions upon women in 1 Corinthians 14 can be used to try "prophets" and measure the spiritual maturity of teachers (14:37-38). It goes without saying that Stanton's "Woman's Bible" fails this test! It is filled with doctrines of devils. 

Clara B. Neyman, another writer in "The Woman's Bible," provides what has become a popular interpretation of Deborah in the Book of Judges:

"In Judges, to woman in various ways is given an exalted position...[But] the time has come for us to point out the evil of many of [the Bible's] teachings...Deborah dispensed justice directly...God never discriminates...The Old Testament and the New Testament are books written by MEN; the COMING BIBLE will be the result of the efforts of both [men and women]...and heaven will be here on earth..."
("The Woman's Bible," 1898)

She is looking for the ancient, Gnostic, feminist Utopia to arrive on earth. A more modern "Christian" feminist also sees Deborah as a feminist role model:

"Our daughters do not know that Deborah was a commander-in-chief..."
(Patricia Gundry, "Woman Be Free!," 1979)

Her book title uses "freedom" as the bait. But the teaching of the book is not Biblical freedom from sin's dominion. It advocates an unbiblical freedom from God's commands to women, which is really bondage to self. The title sounds like the warning in 2 Peter 2, where false teachers will entice (and ensnare) young believers with the promises of "liberty," as they despise God's ordained government (2 Peter 2:19,10) - especially in the home and church.

Does the Biblical teaching of Deborah provide justification for the carnal dreams of feminists?: 

Judges 4:1 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. 
2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 
3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. 
4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 

There are two possible answers to the feminist interpretation of Deborah that we will examine:
1. Deborah's "judging" did not involve ruling over men in civil affairs.
2. Deborah's judging did involve ruling over men, but it was only used by God in an effeminate age, but not approved of by Him as a pattern for women.

The first thing we notice in Judges 4:1-5 is that Deborah is identified by her husband. She is called by the Holy Ghost, "the wife of Lapidoth." This is a far cry from "Hillary Rodham," and it is certainly something the feminists hope you will overlook.

In the history that unfolds, we see Deborah encouraging men in an age of sin and cowardliness:
Judges 5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? 

Idolatry makes men effeminate. And it brings down God's judgments. These men had abandoned their weapons (spiritually and literally). 

Deborah calls herself a "mother in Israel" (Judges 5:7). Perhaps she was both a literal mother and a mother to the nation, in the sense that she nurtured manliness and courage in the men. 

Near the end of 19th century the most powerful women in America (wives and mothers of generals, political leaders, etc.) proclaimed that they saw voting and political power as a demotion. They valued their influential power at the side of the cradle, and at the side of their husbands, and they were not willing to trade this glorious birthright for a mess of feminist pottage. A poll taken in the first part of the 20th century concluded the same views from women in general. These women concluded that the screaming feminists did not represent the majority of women, but only a vocal few who were being used for political ends. Even in this "enlightened" day, Ann Coulter has argued that the follies of liberalism are continually promoted by women having voting rights. These facts argue against the idea that when women are under the headship of men (1 Corinthians 11:3), they are powerless and useless.

Women certainly have a great God-given gift and ability to inspire men and motivate them to great things. Deborah is an example of inspiring motherhood. In this, she should be imitated. Mothers who desire to shelter their sons from manhood and courageous enterprises should learn from Deborah one of the most powerful strengths of true femininity.

Along this line, the next question concerns the manner in which Deborah "judged" Israel. Immediately it should be seen that there are some great differences that manifest themselves when we compare Deborah to the other "judges." Deborah is called a prophetess. She is not a military warrior. People go to her place to hear her "judgments." She does not travel around in a circuit. The exact nature of her judgments are not specified. She calls a man to go to war, and had no intention of going with him to encourage him until he demanded it to his own dishonor. 

The word "judge" ("judgments," etc.) in the Bible has manifold meanings. Sometimes it refers to comprehending or giving Biblical light (1 Corinthians 2:15); sometimes it refers to the actions of civil magistrates (Exodus 18:21-22), and sometimes it refers to rendering vengeance upon enemies and deliverance for the people of God. For example, Samson never ruled as a civil magistrate, but he certainly was used by God to punish the enemies of Israel. John the Baptist gave king Herod Biblical light; but he did not have the authority to enact a judicial penalty. Likewise, the church has the keys of the Kingdom, but not the civil sword of the state. 

There is no prohibition in the Scriptures on women giving Biblical light to others. Women proclaimed the resurrection to the disciples. The Samaritan woman called attention to the Messiah. The daughters of Philip prophesied. Wisdom ( a "she") calls for men to be wise (Proverbs 8:1). But there is a Biblical prohibition upon women addressing the church (the mixed assembly), or being appointed in any place that usurps the authority of men (1 Timothy 2:12). The Bible speaks against women ruling in the affairs of state:

Isaiah 3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. 

Therefore, the feminist must first prove that the word "judge" means that Deborah exercised civil authority over men. Deborah abides under her palm tree, as a godly wife and mother, and she gives the Lord's light to all who will hear in a time of evil. Or, perhaps the children of Israel only come to her to ask for deliverance from their bondage (Judges 4:5-6). She then immediately calls Barak to be the military leader. He is listed (instead of Deborah) by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament list of judges:

Hebrews 11:32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of BARAK, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

Deborah herself refers to civil governors, and she praises them for following the motivating light from God that she gave to Barak:

Judges 5:9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

The NIV (with homosexual feminists involved in the translation) wrongly translates Judges 4:4:

"Deborah was LEADING Israel at this time."
(NIV)

Why didn't they change the name of the Book of Judges to the Book of Leaders? There is an obvious attempt to propagate feminist views in this wording.

Other commentators have rightly called attention to the distinct manner in which Deborah "judged"; she only gave forth the word of God to all who came to her, like Huldah the prophetess (2 Kings 22:14):

"Though a mother is chosen SHE IS NOT CALLED TO SACRIFICE ANY WOMANLY GRACE IN PERFORMING THE TASK. Deborah was no Amazon. Hers was not the fierce fighting of Barak. She was a prophetess. Her mission was to inspire and encourage."
(The Pulpit Commentary)

"Deborah cannot lead the army, but she can inspire it...It is peculiarly woman's work to cheer and encourage those who are called to the dangerous tasks of life. Wives and mothers who dissuade their husbands and sons from their duty because it appears to be dangerous are indulging in weak and foolish affection. The highest love will seek to encourage those who are loved in all that is great and noble."
(The Pulpit Commentary)

"...we conclude that Deborah's role as prophet and judge was not exercised in such a way that she ruled over men."
(John Piper and Wayne Gruden, Recovering Biblical Manhood & Womanhood, 1991, p. 504)

"Complementarian women want to strengthen men as leaders, providers, and protectors. Egalitarian women want to replace men in these roles. The most convincing evidence that Deborah was a womanly woman, 'complementarian' in belief and practice, is to look at the results of her life. If Deborah had been egalitarian, her goal would have been to take Barak's job, not exhort him to do it. Her goal would have been to arise as a deliverer, not as a mother. She would have exploited Barak's invitation to the battlefield, not reproved it."
(Barbara Mouser) 

On the other hand, let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the word "judged" MUST be taken in the sense of civil authority. Is it not amazing that feminists would attempt to utilize the Book of Judges where God often uses people to accomplish His purposes who were not always the best role models in other parts of their lives? The Bible (as observed by the feminists themselves) is so against their views, that they must twist what few places appear on the surface to give some justification to their agenda.

If we pretend that Deborah ruled men, why is it automatically concluded that Deborah's "judging" is anymore approved of God than Samson's rebellious womanizing? God used his womanizing as an occasion against the Philistines. God can also use women who rule over men in dark times to accomplish His purposes. The fact that something is "of" the Lord does not always mean in Scripture that it is perfectly consistent with His will; it simply means that it is used by God (overruled) for His purposes. Read carefully the following verses concerning Samson:

Judges 13:24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times... 

Judges 14:1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
3 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
4 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
6 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him...

Judges 15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. 

Judges 16:1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.
4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
13...And he judged Israel twenty years.

Judges 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

Judges 21:23 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Judges 2:16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

From these verses it is obvious that the fact that God uses someone as a judge (to deliver Israel) in no way justifies all of the conduct of their lives. In the same way, God used the kings of Babylon and Assyria as His own "sword" and "servant" (Isaiah 10:5-7, Jeremiah 27:6); but He certainly did not approve of all of their actions!

The Lord's use of a woman at a time when men are passive no more sanctions women leaving their place than the Lord's use of Samson sanctions men chasing outlandish women!
In light of these facts, notice the erroneous manner in which postmillennialist Gary DeMar argues in "Should Sarah Palin be in Politics?": 

"God Himself establishes Deborah as a judge. When the people 'cried out to the Lord,' Judge Deborah was the answer to their prayers (Judges 4:2-3)...there is no condemnation of Deborah...if God had disapproved of Deborah as a judge, it seems to me that Israel would have lost the battle with Jabin...we are not called on to judge the Deborahs of our time..."

If Mrs. Palin would like to sit under a shade tree in her front yard and advise people with the Scriptures who come to her, few would raise a protest. But Demar might just as well argue that Samson should have lost all his battles since God did not state in the context that Samson's fornication was a sin! Yet Samson defeated his enemies. 

For these reasons, many have rightly argued that much in Judges 4 is "descriptive," but not necessarily "prescriptive" for us:

"The period of the judges is an especially precarious foundation for building a vision of God's ideal for 
leadership. In those days God was not averse to bringing about states of affairs that did not conform to His revealed will in order to achieve some wise purpose...We must also keep in mind that God's granting power and revelation to a person is no sure sign that this person is an ideal model for us to follow in every respect...some of those God blessed in the Old Testament were polygamists..."
(John Piper and Wayne Gruden, Recovering Biblical Manhood & Womanhood, 1991)

The story of Deborah is not a foundation for feminism; it actually teaches the opposite viewpoint. The proper understanding of Deborah can be seen in God's use of Jael. Deborah praises Jael and points out that she was used by God to slay the Canaanite general:

Judges 5:24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

Jael also is identified by her husband; and the "tent" is shown to be the special responsibility of women (see Genesis 18:9), like the "house" in later times. This is where Sisera was slain to the shame of men. God can use women in their place to do great things that will confound the mighty. God's strength is made perfect in weakness. In the Book of Judges we see the Lord slaying the enemies of Israel with the jawbone of an ass, a despised son of a harlot (Judges 11:1), and a common woman in her tent!

It seems that the plain, moral teachings of the Old Testament are constantly despised by many modern Christians: "Away with Deuteronomy! You must only live by the New Testament!" Yet, suddenly, when faced with the plain commands of the New Testament concerning women, there is a cry to go back to the Old Testament, to the Book of Judges - a book that shows (among other things), a man giving his concubine to wicked men, and then cutting her into pieces (Judges 19), and Israelites catching women for wives like they were animals to be trapped (Judges 21)! 
 
The following words should call us to sobriety in these perilous times. We should never trade the Biblical view of the family for the "Republican view" or the "liberal view," or any other view, but God's view!:
"I am fully convinced that a great deal of Christians will follow the Republican Party into the gates of hell as long as they can continue to convince them that it is better than being a Democrat. (It reminds me of the piggish phrase in Animal Farm, 'Surely you do not want Jones to come back, anything is better than Jones!') I can say this because I have witnessed the fact that what the Republican Party calls 'family values' holds more sway with Evangelical voters than the Scripture's teaching on the family...I believe that we are no more than 50 years out from seeing Christians elect (or at least support) the first homosexual Republican for the highest office in our nation. Scoff if you like, but 50 years ago it would have been unheard of for a Christian to support a feminist. It should be clear by the present political landscape that the judgment of God is on our nation, our churches, and our families; while Christians uncannily applaud their own execution."

I would only add that, unless there is a great revival, or the Lord returns, such abominable pragmatism will likely occur before the end of 20 years!

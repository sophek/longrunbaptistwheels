"The best fruits of Christianity have sprung from the seeds our translation has scattered."1
- Alexander McClure

A modern KJV critic will demand that the KJV Onlyist give him "proof" that the KJV is perfect. This is meant to confuse and confound the King James Bible believer. However, this demand is easily met by another demand. This is a method of argumentation that Christ Himself as the living Word of God used (Mr.11:29). Simply ask the KJV critic to likewise prove that the Christian revelation is true in general. What are his reasons for believing that the Christian "bible" (whatever it is to the KJV critic) is true? The answers he gives will be the same answers that one can use to prove the KJV itself is God's perfect Word.
This should immediately take the edge off of any sarcasm that may be present. The KJV critic has put the KJV believer on the spot to come up with some kind of tangible evidence that he himself cannot give for the Christian religion in general. There is, of course, infallible evidence for the Christian religion, as well as the KJV. (The amazing, internal unity of the KJV is one of the most powerful arguments for its perfection. This argument is developed in Book II.) Yet, all evidence must be accepted. When the KJV critic is given some of his own medicine, it forces him to consider the nature of the evidence he is demanding from the KJV believer. The KJV critic may not receive the evidence for the KJV's perfection. Yet, neither will hardened unbelievers receive the evidence that the KJV critic gives for Christianity itself. This reminds us that no one can convince a person of something he or she is not willing to believe. Such a person will always hold to some "objection." Notice how the Pharisees responded to Christ:

John 7:49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

Jesus was not born in Galilee. Nevertheless, they thought this was a good argument against Him. This simply reveals that many KJV critics may not receive the evidence for the KJV Only position for the same reason many hardened unbelievers may never embrace the evidence for Christianity itself. No evidence, no matter how solid, will ever convince a stubborn person of something he chooses to reject. Furthermore, we must always take into account what a person may lose if a certain viewpoint proved correct. KJV Onlyism would hurt the wallet of Bible publishers, bookstores, seminaries and many pastors. Thus, we may immediately discern the reason for the stubbornness in many KJV critics.

When asked to prove the Christian revelation itself, many will offer a simple argument of "fruit." They will point to the good that Christianity has brought to the world. They will point to the vast multitude of changed lives. They will show that Christianity, when free from superstition and corrupt, human tradition, has improved every aspect of society. This is certainly true. Countries such as India have been cursed under Eastern mysticism. Fruit seems to follow true Christianity wherever it goes.

This argument for Christianity is also an argument for the perfection of the KJV. Where is God's perfect, preserved Word today? One does not need a degree in ancient languages to find the answer to that question. Simply examine the fruit. Fruit proves that the KJV is God's perfect Word today. Any objection that the KJV critic makes against this claim will be the same objection an unbeliever will make to the argument of fruit in regard to Christianity itself.
For example, the KJV critic will claim that other bible versions, texts or copies have also brought forth fruit. Yet, that is the very thing an unbeliever will say about the fruit of Christianity in general. The unbeliever will claim that all religions have brought forth some fruit. Yet, such an unbeliever would be told that although some degree of morality can be seen in all religions, only Christianity has brought forth true, holy fruit in great abundance. This is also how the KJV Onlyist should answer the objection of the KJV critic. Only the KJV has brought forth holy, abundant fruit to such a degree that is stands alone, high above all other bibles, versions, etc. Wherever the KJV has been believed and loved in history, society has been blessed and changed magnificently! The KJV critic might claim that some new bibles have not had the time that the KJV has had. Yet, the unbeliever might claim the exact same thing about some new cult.

Where is God's perfect Word today? It is important that we do not start with any assumptions. We must simply search for the Book that is bringing forth the most holy fruit. In this compromised, adulterous age, what Book is loved and trusted by those Christians who are still holding on to godly, holy standards? And what Book has brought forth fruit in the past when the world was blessed with great revivals in holiness? We are not looking for a book that has simply brought forth holy revivals. We are looking for THE Book that has brought forth the MOST fruit of all books, bibles, versions, copies, translations, etc. What Book has brought forth the most revivals? It can be proven that the Book that has been used the most in the history of Christianity is a Book that is in the English language called the King James Bible.

Let us document this claim by many testimonies. Coxe in 1857 writes:

"The Holy Scriptures, as translated in the reign of king James the First, are the noblest heritage of the Anglo-Saxon race. Contemporary with the rise of Colonial emigration from the great hive of parent life and enterprise, the English Bible, of that epoch, would seem designed, by Providence, to be the parting blessing of the Mother of nations to her adventurous progenyâ€¦Two centuries complete, have identified even its slightest peculiarities with the whole literature, poetry, prose, and science, as well as with the entire thought and theology of these ages, and the time, to all appearance, is forever past, when any alteration can be made in it, without a shock to a thousand holy things, and to the pious sensibilities of millionsâ€¦can any other [i.e. translation] that can now be made, become what this is, to the world?"2

Joseph Charles Philpot in 1857 writes:

"â€¦it would unsettle the minds of thousands, as to which was the Word of God â€“ the old translation or the new. What a door it would open for the workings of Satan!â€¦what a confusion this would create in almost every place! At present, all sects and denominations agree in acknowledging our present version to be the standard of appealâ€¦If the new translation were at once to begin, where would it end?â€¦The Socinianising Neologian would blot out â€˜Godâ€™ in 1 Tim.3:16, and strike out 1 John 5:7 as an interpolationâ€¦The present English Bible (Authorized Version) has been blessed to thousands of the saints of Godâ€¦It is, we believe, the grand bulwark of Protestantism; the safeguard of the Gospelâ€¦"3

The writer knew what he was talking about! His prediction came to pass. Today, the NIV and the NAS are the rotten offspring of what started not long after Philpot wrote his warning. Like the RV, the NIV and NAS both remove "God" from 1 Tim.3:16 and strike the Trinity out of 1 John 5:7.

An article in 1858 likewise states:

"...All the outcry against the faithfulness and the correctness of this [King James] version avails little...it would throw the Christian world into inextricable confusion...it would annihilate the common dialect of the English and American Christian world, to substitute a new for our beloved old version of the Scriptures. We may confidently hope that the Providence of God will never permit such a measure to be carried out. We may expect that the English Bible, which has comforted so many Christian, and converted so many unchristian, hearts, which has enlightened and guided so many erring intellects, which has been the rhetorical no less than the spiritual teacher of such authors as Bunyan and Baxter and Addison and Wordsworth, will teach and gladden and guide their successors to the end of time."4
-Bibliotheca Sacra

The writer of the article knew there was something special about the KJV. He, like Coxe, gave a sober warning to later generations not to attempt to replace it.

Alexander McClure also gave a similar warning in 1858:

"Whosoever attempts to shake the confidence of the common people in the common version, puts their faith in imminent peril of shipwreck. He is slipping the chain-cable of the sheet-anchor, and casting their souls adrift among the breakers."5

It was not long after these warnings were written that some scholars did attempt to offer a new "bible" to the Christian community (i.e. 1881). Yet, thankfully, the people immediately rejected it. People would not give up their beloved KJV so soon:

"The revisers were to introduce as few changes as possible, consistent with fidelity to the text. However, many changes were made...a large proportion seemed pointless to the general reader, and, in respect of the New Testament at least, the revisers were accused of pedantry."6
-The Cambridge Bible Handbook

The London Dispatch to the New York Tribune (1881) states:

"The revised version of the New Testament was awaited with keen interest, and was received with an almost unbroken chorus of disapproval. The public are astounded at the number and character of the changes in the Authorized text...Elaborate criticisms appear in most of the daily papers, all condemnatory...These articles quote scores of examples where the changes were purely frivolous and capricious, and denounce the self-opinionated scholarship of the motley combination of theologians and professors, which has disfigured, mangled and made unrecognizable some of the noblest passages in the Bible. The Saturday Review complains of the childish pedantry of the revisers, and describes the new version as sadly inferior to the old one in general vigor and beauty of language."

Notice further testimonies of the publicâ€™s rejection of Wescott and Hortâ€™s RV:

"Whatever may be the opinion of some, the public has long since weighed the Revised Version in the balances and found it wanting...They have turned away from the new with a conviction that it could be no substitute for that which still forms the moral and spiritual backbone of the English people...The Authorized Version is the outcome of faith and zeal that have never been excelled. How is this to be accounted for?...The Revisers cannot be said to have been baptized in the same spirit or to have been overwhelmed by any such self-devotion. They have clung to the most ancient copies without any regard to their character...An unlooked for discovery has shown that the alterations made by the Revisers were for the worse and not for the better. After their NT was issued, Ciasca lighted upon an Arabic translation of Tatian's Diatessaron. This takes us back to the text of the year 150, and decides in favor of the Authorized readings against those of the Revised...Those preachers who confide in them, and who give their congregations 'the more correct reading', are not airing their knowledge but revealing their ignorance."7
-Word and Work Magazine

In 1924, Philip Mauro wrote:

'What shall we then say to these things? Shall we accept the R.V. (either the English or American) as a substitute for the A.V.? That question, we take it, has been settled by the almost unanimous rejection of the modern Versions...We say that the question whether or not the R.V. should supplant the A.V. has been settled by the people themselves who, for whatever reason or reasons, and whether influenced or not by the Spirit of God, have, and with increasing emphasis, rejected the New Version. Thus, while the report of the British Bible Society for the year 1911 showed that about four percent (one out of 25) of the Bibles and Testaments issued by that Society in that year were of the R.V., the full report issued in 1920, shows that less than two percent (one out of 50) were of the R.V. The number of users of the R.V. therefore is not only small proportionately, but is dwindling. ...As an appropriate conclusion we quote an editorial that appeared in a daily newspaper (The Boston Herald, Aug. 1, 1923), in which some striking facts concerning 'the Bible' are put together (and let it be remembered that it is the A.V. which is here regarded as 'the Bible'). 'The Real Best Seller' (Boston Herald, Aug. 1, 1923): 'Every day 80,000 copies. Every year 30,000,000 copies. And the presses day and night straining their bolts to supply the demand. 'A new book? No, a very old one...A book of universal circulation. Translated into 700 languages and dialects. Put into raised type for the blind. Placed in all the guest rooms of the hotels, aboard all the ships of the navy, in all the barracks of the army...The world's best seller. Outstripping all the novels with their occasional records of 100,000, even 200,000, occasionally more, in a single year. Everybody knows what the book is-THE BIBLE OF COURSE.'"8

It can be seen that from 1611 to the 1920's the KJV reigned supreme as THE Bible. No other version, translation, copy, or text, in any language, brought forth as much fruit as the KJV:

"For almost three centuries the Authorized, or King James, Version has been the Bible of the English-speaking worldâ€¦During all these centuries the King James Version has become a vital part of the English-speaking world, socially, morally, religiously, and politically."9
-The Ancestry of our English Bible
The King James Bible would continue to thrive and bless the world. In 1930, the periodical Serving and Waiting observed:
"It is estimated that thirty-six and a half million copies of the Bible were printed last year - 'seven hundred volumes a minute, night and day, was the average output.' In the United States alone fourteen million copies of the Bible were published - four times the number of books and pamphlets in the Library of Congress. Modern versions are reported to have made little appeal, and the King James Version remains in greatest favor."10

As late as 1941, an article in the The Dallas Morning News stated:

"The King James Bible is the cornerstone of Anglo-Saxon civilization. Over a period of some three hundred and thirty years nearly twelve generations of English-speaking peoples have come to know the Bible in this incomparable translation. Our economic systems, our literary and cultural pursuits are rooted in this single fructifying source."11

Amazing! Such a statement would never be said about any other version, copy or translation (notice, it is even from a secular source)! Truly the KJV has blessed the world with more fruit than any other book on the face of the earth.
Nevertheless, the early 1950's would not be so fruitful. Many Christians would then begin to grow restless. In the post war years believers began to let down their guard. While the original Revised Version was rejected in the 1880's, the new Revised Standard Version of the 1950's would be largely embraced. The early warnings were forgotten. The new Revised Standard Version actually topped the non-fiction bestseller list from 1952 to 1954. This was the same time that multitudes were also buying heretical books such as The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale (1952) and Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care by Dr. Benjamin Spock. And what fruit would come from all of this? The children raised on the Revised Standard Version would become the rebellious high-school and college aged youth of the 1960's! Certainly anyone with eyes can see the difference between Christianity after 1950 compared to that which has gone before. The KJV brings fruit. Where it is rejected, all the fruit is spoiled.
There was at first an outcry by fundamentalists who tried to sound the alarm and warn Christians not to embrace this new version. One fundamentalist periodical proclaimed in 1953:

"This revised version is sponsored by The National Council of Churches of Christ in America and we have given to understand that two of the translators are known Communists...From our radio today came the announcement that a certain Baptist preacher is planning to publicly burn one of these new Bibles as a protest against its use...The translators have consistently toned down and removed passages teaching the deity of Jesus Christ..."12
-The Midnight Cry

Nevertheless, such warnings went unheeded by multitudes of Christians. They changed their glory for that which doth not profit:

Jeremiah 2:13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
The new RV has today been largely forgotten. As late as 1978, John Wahnert could report:

"In the U.S.A., most evangelical Christians continue to use the King James Version."13

Yet, there has been a flood of other new translations since the 1950's. What has been the result? Many American Christians are largely confused. There are conflicting Bible versions everywhere. Surely we are living in the perilous times the Bible warned us about:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

Many Christians have rejected the King James Bible that had once blessed the world and spread revivals for centuries. We have reaped the consequences. If "fruit" is evidence that Christianity is the true religion, then "fruit" proves that the KJV is the true Bible!

The King James Bible believer can now apply his lever. The KJV critic should be asked to manifest his own copy of the absolute, perfect Word of God. What copy, version, translation, etc. of the "Bible" does he hold to be perfect? We would like to compare its fruit to that of our King James Bible. We have documented the effect the KJV has had on society. We would like to see if the critic's "Bible" has ever become the pillar or cornerstone of our civilization. We would like to count the revivals it has spread. We would like to count the souls it has brought to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. We would like to measure its fruit by our KJV, just like we would measure the fruit of Mormonism against true Christianity. Where is the perfect "Bible" of the KJV critic? Where is it, that we may examine it?

Here is where the KJV critic will manifest the weakness of his position. He does not believe that ANY one "Bible" is perfect and infallible. He cannot offer you one translation, copy or version in ANY language that he thinks is absolutely without error. His real problem, therefore, is with the belief that any "Bible" (which a person can hold in his hand today) is perfect. Yet, this is the same thing that the unbeliever will say to the Christian. When the Christian attempts to prove that Christianity is true above all other religions, the unbeliever will mock such an idea in disgust. The unbeliever does not believe there is any ONE religion that is true above others. He may think that some are better than others are; yet he does not have just one that he thinks is the only way. Continually, we find that the KJV critic has much in common with unbelievers. He must use the same arguments against the KJV Only position that unbelievers attempt to use against Christianity itself.

The KJV critic believes that the Greek and Hebrew copies are "closer" to the originals. By learning Greek and Hebrew, a person can supposedly arrive at a "reliable" representation of the Scriptures. Yet, he does not believe a person can ever find the perfect, infallible Word of God, since all the original manuscripts have passed away, long ago.

The reader should examine the doctrinal statements of various churches and ministries. He will immediately see that many believe that the "Bible" is infallible, perfect, without error, inspired, etc. only in the ORIGINAL manuscripts. Since we do not presently have any original manuscripts, this means that these people no longer believe we have a perfect, infallible, inspired Bible! These Christians believe that the copies we now possess have errors and mistakes:

Bruce M. Metzger tell us:

"...a group of correctors working at Caesarea entered a large number of alterations into the text of both Old and New Testaments."14

Gleason L. Archer states:

"Throughout the history of the Christian church, it has been clearly understood that the Bible as originally given by God was free from error."15

James R. White agrees:

"The scribes of old made errors, too...They made mistakes in what they were copying, even when they were copying the Scriptures...All of these things contributed to the fact that there is not a single handwritten manuscript of the Bible, in Greek or Hebrew, that does not contain, somewhere, an error, an oversight, a mistake. To err is human."16

It might indeed be "human" to err. Nevertheless, God is able, in His Providence, to work through fallible man to accomplish His will. There is no chance or luck with God:

Proverbs 16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.

God can therefore preserve His Word perfectly through man. He has the power:

Isaiah 40:8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

Matthew 24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

Why should anyone think it strange or radical that God could cause some men to copy, choose, organize and translate perfectly His words whenever He chooses?:

2 Chronicles 20:6 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

Proverbs 21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

Daniel 2:20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
21 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:

God is not bound by human weakness. He can preserve His Bible perfectly, in whatever manner He sees fit.
It appears that the real contest is between the King James Bible (that so many see as God's perfect, preserved Word) and the KJV critic's "bible" which he admits contains errors. Even so, let the KJV critic bring his fallible, imperfect "bible" to the table. It is here that we will most likely find that his "bible" is not even put together in one part! He has one Greek copy for one part, another Greek copy for another part, and so on. His "bible" is therefore revealed to not only have errors, but it is shown to be in MANY scattered pieces! Nevertheless, let him bring these imperfect pieces to the table. We will apply his proof for Christianity to the Bible itself. We will measure his scattered, imperfect pieces against our beloved, mighty King James Bible. We will compare the number of lives that have been changed and the general impact on society. We will, of course, immediately see that the King James Bible will shine above any other so-called "Bible," in much the same way as true Christianity itself shines far above any other religion or cult.

The KJV critic will no doubt respond with one last objection. He will point out that the New Testament was originally written in Greek. Shouldn't we then look for God's perfect, preserved Word (at least in regard to the NT) in the Greek manuscripts?

To start with, the KJV critic does not believe that any Greek manuscript is the perfect Word of God. He will scorn the KJV Onlyist for failing to go to the original Greek language to find the perfect Word of God, yet the KJV critic only believes the Greek is closer to the original than the English. He does not believe any Greek manuscript(s) is the perfect, preserved Word of God.

Secondly, if we are to be honest, we must admit that since the original manuscripts of the Bible have perished, there is no way of absolutely proving that the existing Greek manuscripts have themselves been translated from other Greek manuscripts. They themselves could be translations from some other language into Greek. Modern scholars scorn the KJV as "only a translation", yet they cannot PROVE that the very Greek manuscripts they are studying were copied from Greek manuscripts that were copied from Greek manuscripts, etc., all the way back to the originals!
God is indeed Sovereign. He will keep His promise to preserve His Word. We are not claiming that God did not preserve His Word originally in the Greek language. Even so, He did not have to preserve it in an unbroken line, Greek to Greek. God might have just as easily preserved His Word from Greek to some other language, and back into Greek again! Who can say He did not? It is not man's job to trace how God preserved His Word throughout history. It is man's responsibility to find the perfect Word of God in his day. We must go about finding it the same way a rational man would go about finding the true religion. From 1611 to 1950 the King James Bible has reigned as the greatest, most powerful Book on the face of the earth. When a large number of Christians turned from it, nothing but curses, sin and destruction have followed (1950-2000). God used the Greek language in the past. Yet, from 1611-1950, He used the English Bible more than any Greek copy. To claim that God must always use the original Greek language to preserve His Word above any other language is to state something that no "Bible" (in any copy, translation or version) ever states.

Languages do not bind God. He never promised to preserve His Word in the original languages. If He did, we would like the KJV critic to demonstrate it. Why should we assume that God will preserve His Bible in the original tongues? The very question is beyond the mind of man. It is the responsibility of man to receive whatever God does. It is not man's place to dictate what God will or will not do when He has not directly spoken on the subject. If God never promised that He would preserve His Word in the original languages, then it is Pharisaical presumption to claim that He must. One might as well assume that God would never let the original manuscripts themselves pass away! Do manuscripts bind God? Must the Bible be preserved on the same manuscripts upon which it was originally written? If God must preserve His Word in the same language in which it was originally written, then why not teach that He must also preserve it on the original manuscripts? If it is not practical to preserve the original manuscripts then how practical are the original languages today? No one believes that God has preserved His Word through the original manuscripts. Why then hold dogmatically that original languages bind God?

It is also true that God never promised that He would preserve His Word in English. He simply never told us the exact details of how He would go about preserving His Word. One might reply that it is reasonable to assume that God would continue to use the same languages in which the Bible was originally written. On the other hand, it could also be argued that such would not be a reasonable assumption at all. God did not write the New Testament in Hebrew. He wrote it in the international language of the 1st-century. At least in regard to the New Testament, God left the original Hebrew for a more practical language that would benefit Jew and Gentile. Surely then, it is just as reasonable to assume that when ancient Greek is no longer practical, God would use man to bring His perfect words into the international language of end times. No new inspiration would be required. God, in His power would simply make sure that whenever He was ready, those He decided to use would translate (and choose what to translate) perfectly. God is still involved in the affairs of man; and He is still just as powerful as ever.

IS ENGLISH THE INTERNATIONAL LANGAUGE?

We will conclude this chapter with some proof that English is the international language of these last days. Such a fact is obvious. Nevertheless, many KJV critics will doubt anything in order to combat KJV Onlyism.

God not only used English to preserve His Word, He used it at a time when it was in its purest form:

"...our translation is by far the purest of them all...It shuns or rather knows not the language of philosophy and science, but uses those words which find a ready response in every English heart. Herein appears the wisdom of God in ordering its preparation at the period in which it was made. Our language was at that time settled. Before then its character was fluctuating; it then assumed a fixed form. Since then it has undergone some changes, and received some additions, which though not rendering it less intelligible to scholars, have made it deviate somewhat from the simplicity and clearness...of the popular speech. Had the Bible been translated at any other time, it would have been like some of the earlier versions, clothed in the forms of an obsolete tongue; or perhaps like some modern paraphrases, decked out in the less simple and universally familiar garb of a Latin and French philosophical style. But it is translated in the tongue 'that Shakespeare spake', a tongue which must ever be intelligible so long as the English people remain English. It is to be observed, moreover, that the language of the Bible, its style, seems now irrecoverable. It is as though the speech consecrated by that noble use refused to be profaned by being employed to express the wisdom or the folly of a later age."17
-Bibliotheca Sacra

"Who believes it possible that another translation can be produced in our time, which shall command the like acceptance; and without strife or controversy, take, among the English-speaking population of the globe, the place now held by our venerable version? This translation was completed at a fortunate time. The English language had passed through many and great changes, and had at last reached the very height of its purity and strength. The Bible has since been the grand English classic. It is still the noblest monument of the power of the English speech. It is the pattern and standard of excellence therein...It has given a fixed character to our language. It is as intelligible now as when it was first imprinted; and will be as easily understood by readers of coming centuries as by those of the past and present."18
-Alexander McClure

"The English language was in its prime and purity; its wells were undefiledâ€¦Even the antiquated words of the English Bible will never become obsolete, while they are preserved in the amber of its [i.e. the KJVâ€™s] purity."19
-A. Coxe

Thus, the King James Bible itself preserves this most exalted, purest form of English. It was this state of the English language that was able to fully receive God's perfect Word. God knew that English would become the international language of the last days. There is no other language as universal. In His providence, He therefore worked through fallible men to translate His Word to perfection in English.

It is easy to prove that English (the first language spoken on the moon) is the international language. At least 350 million people speak English as a native language. Over 350 million additional people use English as their second language. English is the international language of airlines. It is the universal language of the Internet. English is the native language of 45 countries. Increasingly, more nations are adopting a bilingual system in which their national language and English coexist. Most of the world's books, newspapers, periodicals and computer files are written in English. It is therefore easy to see why God has chosen the English language to preserve His perfect Word for mankind in these final days of history before the second coming of Christ.

The author continues to receive letters and e-mail from King James Bible believers all over the world. In many lands, where there are multiple dialects, the KJV brings unity:

"I've got more comprehension on KJV from you. Thank you very much for your help. I believe that KJV is the perfect preserved WORD of GOD. Stand fast in this ministry.
-From a college student in Korea

"I'm glad that there's a church out there in Texas that really proclaim God's Only book - the King James Bible. Keep on. You've some friends in the Philippines that believe the book too."
-Pastor Joey G, Pampanga, Philippines

"â€¦On Sunday I gave a teaching in our little group on the new age bible versions and that people need to get back to the KJB. I was amazed that so many had never even seen that new translations were wrong in so many ways."
Kittie L., Cape Town, South Africa

Such testimonies from around the world could be multiplied. God knew what the world needed when He ordained the KJV. It is truly the "Authorized" Version!

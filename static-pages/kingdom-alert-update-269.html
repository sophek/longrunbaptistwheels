INTRODUCTION TO MY REVIEW OF RIPLINGER'S NEW BOOK
***********************************************************

As I have sadly shown in the past, Laura Schlessinger has stronger, more Biblical views on the family, women, motherhood (and many other subjects) than many of today's fundamental pastors. Why is this? Also, Tammy Bruce (a feminist lesbian!!) in, "The Death of Right and Wrong," has grown so sick of the unwillingness of people to speak out against moral relativism and the Cult of Victim-hood, that she has written some books that are again, more bolder and plainer (without being wickedly harsh) than many fundamentalists would be willing to write! How can this be? What in the world is happening? Where are God's people? Where are God's men? I am only calling attention to the fact that idolatry has caused a great effeminacy to sweep through our land (Romans 1). We are all guilty to some degree (though some are guiltier than others). Deborah sang about what happens to godly manhood very soon after idolatry is embraced:

Judges 5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

In the midst of their idolatry, and love of ease, they were attacked. But the men did not even have a shield or spear! Where were the men? They had been weakened into effeminacy by their idolatry. Deborah arose as a mother in Israel to encourage and provoke the men to stand and be brave for God. And when General Barak wavered, he was forced to share some of the glory with Jael, a woman.

Mrs. Riplinger is a modern Deborah. She is calling godly men to be brave, and not to tremble before the Goliath's of mass marketing, glossy promotions, scholastic titles, etc. We do not have to be intimidated into relativism, or be enslaved by the priests of modern textual criticism (who are hirelings for publishing companies, often owned by lost men, who seek to make merchandise of the saints). Quit ye like men! Read. Study. And Stand! Thank you Mrs. Riplinger, for another great work.

This book is 1177 pages. I recently read every word of this wonderful book. Of course, books we agree with are easier reading. On the other hand, as with most important research material today, these pages will likely only be "glanced at" by detractors. We are in an age where many draw conclusions concerning heated controversies before even giving the other side a fair hearing (Proverbs 18:17). This television age no longer has much patience for in-depth reading. It is ever the way of folly to not only answer matters before researching them (Proverbs 18:13), but to also be unable to control the tongue. Everyone has an opinion. But how many have spent the time in studying important issues in a circumspect manner? I do hope than many will give this book the time it deserves.

The book starts out with some previews for each chapter. This is a good idea. The use of red, bold, italics, graphics, charts, underlines (and all footnote/reference material in smaller print, right in the text) also make for an interesting, easier read.

In Chapter 1, Riplinger begins by noting some examples of how the King James Bible defines its own words by the use of "built-in" definitions, context, parallel syllables, sounds, concepts, etc. 

In Chapter 2, Riplinger introduces an interesting subject of letter meanings. She calls attention to the various studies that are taking place by linguistic researchers in MIT, Stanford, etc. For example, she writes: "Magnus observed that 41% of 'G' words relate to largeness, as I also discovered" (p.105). This same researcher writes: "One sense of 'str' is linearity; string, strip, stripe, street, etc. And one sense of 'ap' is flat: cap, flap, lap, map, etc. If you put them together, you get a flat line: 'strap' (p.104)." Riplinger then makes the point that the English Bible is the bedrock of English culture and thought. She shows how replacing simple, foundational words with complex synonyms (like modern versions are forced to do) undermines much of the word-pictures and perceived definitions that are found in the very heart and soul of the English language. The point is, there may be much more at stake than simply the actual textual reading of a Bible verse. The Lord has !

 ordained the Bible to be memorized and understood, and modern versions are causing more confusion than many have realized.

In Chapter 4, Riplinger opens up the fascinating subject of "onomatopoeia." She notes that linguists, by aid of computers, have discovered that individual letters have meanings, and that even the letter sounds can bring meaning to words. She also reveals how the shape of letters form a pictogram that helps in defining words. (For example, later in the book, she notes how the "up and down" shape of the letter "w" reveals the meaning of many "w" words, such as "waves," "waters," "whales," "wing," "wandering," "wavering," "weaving," "writing," "warping," etc.)

In Chapter 5, Riplinger opens up the subject of word associations. She reveals how the King James Bible uses words that bring to the mind wholesome, undefiled word associations. She shows, for example, how the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (Word Association Response) claims that the word "fornication" brings to mind the ideas of "bible, adultery, sin, lust, death, and debauchery." Yet, the word "sexual" (used by modern versions) brings to mind "sex, pleasure, desire, attraction, enjoyment, excitement, freedom, fun, ecstasy." She shows how the King James Bible captures the wonderful simplicity of earlier English versions, such as the Bishop's Bible, while at the same time it uplifts the language to fit the majestic, holy, reverential tone that is fitting for the Word of God. This is obviously not an easy balance to achieve. Yet, the Authorized Version, as God's Word in the English language, has accomplished it.

Chapter 6 is a study of the beautiful sound, rhythm, diction, alliteration, etc. that distinguishes the King James Bible from its predecessors, and from modern versions. Riplinger quotes often from Ward Allen, Hargis Professor of English Emeritus at Auburn University.

In Chapter 7, Riplinger documents the fact that the King James Bible uses shorter, simpler words. The new versions are shorter only where they omit whole words and verses (as in the NIV's omission of 64,000 important words). She shows some examples of the succinct phrases found in the KJV, which makes them more memorizable than the modern versions. When the KJV uses a difficult word, it often defines it with a simpler synonym, in the same verse or chapter (see "tithe" and "tenth part" in Hebrews 7:2,6).

In Chapter 8, Riplinger quotes Emeritus English Professor Ward Allen who documents how the KJV's literary techniques actually make it easier to understand. He writes, on Romans 8: "The R.S.V. points up the shine of this perfection by DULLING it in rearrangement of the words....the text of the A.V. shines the brightest from rubbing and polishing."

Chapter 9 continues with quotes from various secular scholars on the beauty of the King James Bible's "rhythmic patterning," "cadences," "repetitions," etc. She shows how even Harvard University's "Literary Guide to the Bible," refers to the N.I.V. as "diluted by deliberate variations....[M]odern translators...now mask the techniques of repetition which are so basic to the literary effects of the Bible....[T]he reader of a modern version...can find no such pattern..." Not only do new version committees lack the skill of the "Renaissance translators," but they are also forced by copyright law to pick words that sound cumbersome, boring, stale, and lifeless.

Chapter 11 is an excellent, much-needed study on the words Jesus and Jehovah. This chapter is a strong, well-documented rebuke of the "Yaweh" movement. Riplinger writes: "In the 19th century, as unbelieving German critics were hammering away at the word of God, they tried to refashion God's name, JEHOVAH. They asserted that the God of Israel's name should be pronounced 'Yahweh' because, to them, he was nothing more than an offshoot of the pagan deity 'Yaho'..." After quoting extensive documentation from John Gill, and others, Riplinger writes, "Not only is the name Yahweh, incorrect, the hybrid hyped-Hebrew noise 'Yashua' has never been the Hebrew pronunciation of the name 'Jesus,' neither in Bible days, nor in modern Hebrew....even in today's seminary textbooks, the myth is presented that the Masoretes added the vowels to the Bible in the 10th century. Gill proves this wrong [as does Johannes Buxtorf in 1648]."

Chapter 12 is also an excellent study. In this chapter, Riplinger discusses the endings on KJV words ("eth," "est"). She shows the importance of these endings, especially to missionaries and children. Riplinger reveals seven reasons why these endings must be retained. Among these reasons are the fact that it has been discovered that children prefer the sound patterns these endings create, and missionaries need the endings to help bridge the language gap between English and many languages which share the same endings. Riplinger shows that the KJV translators did not use these endings because of the language of the period. They were used to reveal the important grammatical and theological distinctions, in the Greek and Hebrew text. Riplinger quotes Ward S. Allen, who concludes that the translators were RESHAPING English so it could adapt itself to the Biblical languages. While not as important as the doctrinal reasons, Riplinger documents the fascinating studies on how young children prefer TWO SYLLABLE words, over one syllable words (e.g. lov-eth, com-eth, mom-mie, milk-ie, etc.).

In Chapter 13, Riplinger shows the weaknesses in the "Easy Reading KJV-ER" version (for example, it defines "hell" as the "lake of fire"). She also calls attention to the hypocrisy of saying that children will have trouble with the KJV, when almost the whole world is jumping for joy at the BRITISH ENGLISH used in the Harry Potter books. Sadly, how many little children have no problem even pronouncing words from other languages like Pokemon, Ninja, Nike, or names of the favorite characters like "Obeewankanobe"? How can children memorize the Bible (like children of old) when there are so many different variations between the so-called "bibles" used in Sunday School, church, and home devotions?

Chapter 14 is another excellent chapter. It shows how Richard Kilby (a KJV translator) once visited a church and, "'found the young preacher to have no more discretion, than to waste a great part of the hour allotted for his sermon,' describing 'three reasons why a particular word should have been otherwise translated' in the King James Bible. Kilby went to the pastor's home and....[pointed out that he and others] had considered all [the preacher's reasons] and found THIRTEEN more considerable reasons why it was translated as now printed.'" Certainly, thousands of young (and old) preachers who think they are wiser than the King James translators should do a little research on the linguistic skill, education, and accomplishments of these men! Many who try to show us that they are smarter than these men, are like Michael Jackson trying to correct a piece of music by Bach! Contrast this with KJV translator, John Bois, who though incredibly skilled in Greek and languages from an early age, avoided using Greek in the pulpit, lest he should disparage the English Bible in the eyes of the young! (see Riplinger's book, p.514).

I also certainly agree with the following observation by Riplinger: "Really archaic words, like the street signs, Tartarus and Gehenna (which had meaning to ancient Greeks) are being dug up and used to misdirect English travelers on the road to glory." Riplinger points out that there is not a single Bible verse that states that Bible study should be done in ancient languages. Riplinger writes: "The living Word came in a lowly form, as does his 'engrafted' word." This is true, and I have argued this point in my booklet, "The Common Man's Defense of King James Onlyism."

Speaking of the "common man," Riplinger ends Chapter 14 with a quote from the "Ladies Home Journal" (1921) stating that the King James Bible is better than the Hebrew and Greek, and is inspired! (In my booklet, I document some additional sources to show this belief in earlier ages.) "...And the common people heard him gladly" (Mark 12:37).

In Chapter 15, Riplinger reveals her study of the various notes, now in print, of the KJV translators. She shows how they considered, and REJECTED readings seen in modern versions. In this chapter, Riplinger also presents an argument we have made for years concerning the RESURRECTION of the Word, and how this pictures the rise of the English Bible out of the obscurity of the Dark Ages. Riplinger actually tightens this view, by writing:

"The resurrection and eternal life of Jesus the Word, prefigures the resurrection of the written word from the dead Koine Greek language (gen. 42:21, 23; 45:26,27; Acts 25:19)....When the Word 'appeared in another form,' as Jesus did, 'neither believed they them' (Mark 16;12,12). Likewise, some still dig for words buried in haunted Greek graveyards....Enoch was TRANSLATED that he should not see death...Through Bible translation, Christ and His words can be made known to all nations and generations to come, in spite of the fact that Koine Greek died around A.D. 800 as a spoken language. Modern Greek pronunciation is different in many ways from ancient Koine."

This is excellent. I had maintained that the Bible was resurrected, in the sense that it had fallen out of the hands of the "mainstream" of people. Riplinger makes a better argument, that as the form (the Koine Greek) died, the Word was revived in the English Bible, the new international language of end times (which is very close to what we have maintained and believe). With so many pictures and types in the Bible (Moses breaking the tablets of the law; Jeremiah 36, etc.), it is a wonder than many others have not noticed that "resurrection" is one of God's primary methods of preservation.

Riplinger, in this chapter, also calls attention to the crucial fact that "scripture" is used in the Bible in contexts that reveal that it is dealing with preserved copies or translations (not just original manuscripts). Riplinger shows that the first scholars to maintain that only the originals were inspired were anti-premillennial Princeton University Presbyterians.

In this chapter is also a good refutation of the popular (though erroneous) teaching that "agapao" means God-like love, while "phileo" means brotherly love.

Riplinger also points out that the KJV translators confessed that they were "perfecting" the earlier English versions (of which Tyndale himself had said he was only "beginning").

Section 2 of this book begins with Chapter 16. This chapter offers a detailed study of the life of King James I, absolutely refuting the various lies and rumors that are thrown about in modern times, in a desperate effort to bring reproach upon the Authorized Version. She reveals how King James warned against necromancy (while B.F. Wescott, F.H.A. Hort and J.B. Phillips embraced it and practiced it). She documents how King James himself, at the age of only eight, could read the Bible out of Latin into French, and out of French into English, extremely well; and he could do it, right on the spot, with ANY chapter appointed to him! And this is nothing compared to the great skills possessed by the actual King James Bible translators themselves, at this same age! Riplinger continues in this chapter to give some biographical information in regard to the translators, showing their great devotion, temperance, etc. She quotes their own notes to show that they did not believe in baptismal regeneration (like many modern Anglicans and Episcopalians).

Chapter 19 is an important chapter. It documents the important fact that Britain had the light of the Gospel long before Roman Catholic "missionaries" attempted to "compel" it to embrace Romanism by the literal sword. Riplinger also documents the old Anglo-Saxon Bibles in existence long before Wycliffe began his translation.

Chapter 21 continues this study. The chapter is titled, "English Bibles Before Wycliffe."

Chapter 22 details the views of Wycliffe. Riplinger quotes Wycliffe defending himself against Catholics who accuse him of heresy for speaking of inspired Scriptures in English. She refutes the myths that Wycliffe wrote the first English Scriptures, and that he used the corrupt Latin Vulgate. She shows how Wycliffe himself said he had access to Hebrew Old Testament manuscripts that were in agreement with the OLD Latin texts. She shows how Wycliffe used Old Latin versions, instead of the Vulgate.

Chapter 23 presents the views of Tyndale, with some excellent quotes. She also reminds us of some important history concerning King Edward VI, Bloody Mary, etc.

In Chapter 25, Riplinger quotes from persecuted Christians and their persecutors, the Catholic inquisitors. For example, one Catholic inquisitor stated: "Why, how knowest thou that St. Paul wrote those things that are IN ENGLISH now, it be true, whereas Paul never wrote English or Latin?" These are the types of arguments that Christians were assaulted with before they were burned at the stake. They sound similar to the mockings we hear commonly today. "Did Paul speak English?" Well, as a matter of fact, he probably did speak an early form of it (see 1 Corinthians 14:18).

Chapter 27 is a much-needed study on Erasmus, aptly refuting the various myths about him (especially the myth that he was Roman Catholic). Riplinger provides one quote from Erasmus that shows that men do not change much over the years. In responding to his enemies, Erasmus writes: "They do not argue, because they cannot, and they trust entirely to evil speaking." Riplinger provides abundant quotes proving the vast manuscript resources Erasmus had at hand. She shows that Erasmus gleaned the "book of life" reading in Revelation 22 from Greek manuscripts 2049 or 141. Also, there were numerous translations of the Apocalypse, such as Old French versions, etc. that Erasmus had before him.

Riplinger provides some charts showing that modern versions are simply the Latin Vulgate under a different cover.

In closing this valuable work, Riplinger offers some quotes from linguist H.L. Mencken, and also from Harvard's "Literary Guide to the Bible." These quotes reveal the great extent that the English Bible (especially the King James Bible) had on the formation and preservation of our language, and that the modern temptation to despise these men as "primitive" is foolish and ungrounded (p.1161).

On page 1171, Riplinger mentions a book by ROBERT GOVETT titled, "English Derived From Hebrew," (1869). She quotes the titles of some works that trace English back to Hebrew, showing the Divine origin of language. Robert Govett was a very gifted thinker, and one of the first defenders of literal interpretation in modern times.

Even if you do not intend to read all 1177 pages of this great book by Riplinger, any scholar or pastor that intends to speak about the KJV controversy (on either side of the issue) should at least read the chapters I have highlighted above. I find modern anti-KJV books to be filled with emotional claims, yet lacking in scholarly documentation. I have personally experienced the readiness of many within modern Christianity to dismiss arguments and research without offering counter-arguments. For example, if an argument has already been foreseen, and answered, it is the responsibility of the critic to prove why the answer is ungrounded. Yet, we have too many who will not read, will not study, will not think, and will only offer evil speaking and emotional hype as a response. If Erasmus was alive today, he would indeed find that this tendency in Christians has only grown worse. Mrs. Gail Riplinger has been willing to READ and RESEARCH, and she knows what she is talking about. I highly recommend her works on this subject.

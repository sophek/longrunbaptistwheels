WHO HAS THE GOLD? HOW GOD EXPOSES THE STUBBLE OF SELF-CONFIDENCE WITH HIS
FIERY SILENCE
************************************************************************
(Sermon, Luke 18, (2-29-04) Kingdom Baptist Church, pastor Joey Faust)

TEXT: Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men
OUGHT ALWAYS TO PRAY, and not to faint;
2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
regarded man:
3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying,
Avenge me of mine adversary.
4 And HE WOULD NOT FOR A WHILE: but AFTERWARD he said within himself,
Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
CONTINUAL COMING she weary me.
6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which CRY DAY AND NIGHT UNTO
HIM, though he BEAR LONG with them?
8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son
of man cometh, SHALL HE FIND FAITH on the earth?

In continuation of the series of messages I am preaching upon this
chapter, I would like you to notice that the unjust judge did not hear the
widow because she simply "asked." He heard her BECAUSE of her importunity
or persistence in asking! Our Lord taught us the same principle in Luke
11:

Luke 11:8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he
is his friend, yet BECAUSE OF HIS IMPORTUNITY he will rise and give him as
many as he needeth.

It takes faith to bring our requests to God in prayer. But it takes
strong, mature faith to CONTINUE to bring things to God in prayer when it
appears that He is silent!

It is our responsibility to cleanse our hands, and do things which are
pleasing in God's sight, and to then have faith enough to cast our cares
upon Him in the name of Jesus. Then, when an answer appears to be delayed,
we must examine our request and make sure we are not praying something
contrary to God's revealed will. If the request seems to be Biblical, we
must examine our motives, and make sure they are not corrupt. But when God
appears to be silent, and He has not answered yes or no, we must learn the
CONTINUAL COMING of the widow. We must not faint in our request.

Unless we are deceiving ourselves about our prayer and our lives, it is
very probable that the silence of God is a TEST to prove our faith. Often,
when God is silent, people with weak faith give up on God, and upon
prayer, and turn to the flesh or to the world. In other words, when their
faith is tried, their faith proves to be a house of sand or hay. In other
words, it does not prove to be fine gold, but stubble! Just as persecution
can try faith, so does God's FIERY SILENCE sometimes try our faith:

1 Peter 1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
7 That the TRIAL OF YOUR FAITH, being much more precious than of GOLD that
perisheth, though it be TRIED WITH FIRE, might be found unto praise and
honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
8 Whom HAVING NOT SEEN, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet
BELIEVING, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:

Do we have faith enough to pray? Some do. But do we have faith enough to
CONTINUE TO KNOCK when the door does not IMMEDIATELY open? Jesus implies
that He will not find much faith on the earth when He returns. In short,
this means that few people will pray to God and cast their desires and
cares upon Him. And fewer still, will be patient enough, and mature enough
in their faith, to CONTINUE knocking at the door when there appears to be
silence from God:

"...it is not GOD who is under test [when He is silent], but our own
spiritual maturity."
(J. Oswald Sanders)

In an earlier sermon, we have seen what it means when we do not have time
to pray. It means we are self-confident. In the same way, the more
confidence we have in self and the world, the LESS PATIENCE we will have
in knocking, waiting on God on to answer.

To have strong faith in God means we do not have strong faith in SELF and
the world, independent from God. When faith or confidence in self goes up,
faith in God goes down, and vice versa. Faith in God is confidence in God.
Therefore, SELF-CONFIDENCE, is faith in self:

1 John 5:14 And this is THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN HIM, that, if we
ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

Notice, the confidence (faith) is IN HIM, not in the flesh:

Philippians 3:4 Though I might also have CONFIDENCE IN THE FLESH. If any
other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might TRUST IN THE FLESH, I
more:
8 Yea doubtless, and I COUNT ALL THINGS BUT LOSS for the excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of
all things, and DO COUNT THEM BUT DUNG, that I may win Christ,

Do you have confidence in self? The degree of confidence in self will be
manifested by our prayer life. We may mock this truth as old fashioned
legalism, or unattainable, unrealistic goals of visionary revivalists. But
in the end, it all comes down to the fact that there are people who spend
time in prayer because they know that they NEED God. Those who do not pray
have confidence in the flesh. We may now see why our Lord concludes His
parable about the importunate widow with the question about finding faith.
The widow came to the judge because she was NEEDY and had no other place
to turn. But Laodicea, unlike the widow, sits as a queen, and says she is
rich and in need of nothing:

Revelation 3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
18 I COUNSEL THEE TO BUY OF ME GOLD TRIED IN THE FIRE, THAT THOU MAYEST BE
RICH; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame
of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that
thou mayest see.
 
Laodicea needs GOLD. She has no faith in God. Her faith is in self! Jesus,
in Luke 18, contrasts the Laodicean Christians of the latter days before
His return (of whom he will find no faith), with the poor, NEEDY widow.
When the judge did not respond, she kept coming back, for she knew she had
NO OTHER OPTION. But Laodicea is self-confident. When God does not
respond, she forms a business committee and hires a sales manager, and
sets out to impress God by showing Him that He is not necessary. She can
make it own her own. She views God as a puppy who sits in her lap. She is
going to show God that He did not know what He was doing when He made the
Bible for this age of technology and "science." In short, according to the
Bible, modern Christians will have very shallow, pathetic, anemic prayer
lives. They will mock and despise those who attempt to bring conviction
and repentance. Laodicea doesn't need long periods of fervent prayer. She
can bring "revival" by theaters and VCR's.

This is self-confidence. It is self-faith. It is self-trust. Now see how
the Lord begins the second parable in Luke 18:

Luke 18:8 ...when the Son of man cometh, shall he find FAITH on the earth?
9 And he spake this parable unto CERTAIN WHICH TRUSTED IN THEMSELVES...

Trusting in self, is confidence in self. Who is going to sacrifice time
and energy to pray long and continually who believes there are other
options? And if ever they give it a try and God seems silent, they will
say, "Who needs this? I will make it on my own."

God looks down upon His children to see who will depend upon HIM, to see
who has faith in Him instead of faith in self. To have faith in self
instead of God is a form of idolatry. It is evil. Many believers profess
to have faith in God. Thus, almost all will knock on the door of the
throne room initially. So imagine ten Christians knocking on God's door.
But behind the door, a still, quiet voice says, "All who are knocking do
not have faith. Many are trusting in self. Let us wait a moment to see who
has gold and who has hay and stubble." In a few moments, the fiery silence
has TRIED THE FAITH OF THE TEN. Nine have departed, and only one is left.
The Lord asks, "Where are the nine?" The one answers, "They gave up Lord
when you did not immediately answer. They said they have other means."
"But why did you stay?" The one answers, "Where am I to go? I have nowhere
else to turn. Unless the Lord build the house, the workmen labor in vain."
The Lord answers: "Go in peace, thy faith hath made thee whole.":

Psalms 127:1 EXCEPT THE LORD BUILD THE HOUSE, THEY LABOUR IN VAIN THAT
BUILD IT: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is
his reward.

Proverbs speaks of the woman who tears down her house with her hands. A
godly woman builds her house with prayer and obedience to God. We must do
things God's way, not the way that seems right. And we must ask God's
blessing upon our labors through prayer. But so many of us forsake family
prayer. Men should take note! Except the Lord build the house, we labour
in vain as fathers and husbands. This should destroy the self-confident
spirit that thinks it can do without prayer and Scripture. Too many men
who get in trouble will roll their eyes at the pastor's admonition to have
a period of family prayer daily. They want something more exciting. They
want some shiny, polished counsel. Prayer, like the preaching of the Cross
itself, is deemed to be foolishness. But our Lord stresses prayer to keep
from fainting! If our families are fainting, it is because we have little
prayer! Should we not trust the Lord and His ways? It may sound
legalistic, but if you replace the TV with prayer, you will find abundant
blessings IF YOU STICK WITH IT! The blessing do not always immediately
come. We must have faith to keep knocking, and then God will open to us:

Proverbs 3:5 TRUST IN THE LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
thine own understanding.
6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

The Bible, God's Word, says to pray always, and to cast all our cares upon
Him. The self-confident man will reject this holy, Divine counsel and will
snuff at it, the same way Namaan scorned Elijah's counsel:

2 Kings 5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt
be clean.
11 But Naaman WAS WROTH, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He
will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD
his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.

Namaan concluded that his country had better rivers than the river's of
Israel. And many Christians, in anger at hearing the godly counsel to pray
together, are wise in their own eyes. Others, who have enough faith to
pray initially, will then leave as Namaan, when God dares to be silent.
Laodicean Christians get offended easy. They even get offended at God if
He does not run to meet them the moment they pray. As Namaan, they say,
Who needs this? I will work it out myself. This prayer stuff is all
formality. It is not for our enlightened age."

We must have the humility and faith to give God room to work. We must give
Him the RIGHT in our lives to try us by His fiery silence. Do you have
other gods to turn to? Are you able, by your own hand, to answer your own
prayers? Who has the golden treasure of faith? It is the person who
continues to knock when God is silent. He or she has no other options.
Like the needy widow, with nowhere else to turn, unless God blesses the
work, there is no use in beginning. Unless God opens eyes, and blesses the
preaching of the Word, who will be converted? Shall smooth words and
eloquence bring repentance? Shall speaking in tongues (Greek, Hebrew,
etc.) bring repentance? Unless God builds the house WE LABOUR IN VAIN!
Without Christ, we can do nothing. It is therefore necessary that we pray
much. Bible study without prayer causes us to become stiff and rude, and
to lose a burden for sinners.

There was a time when Moses did not come down from the mount, and the
people grew impatient and gave up on God:

Exodus 32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said
unto him, UP, MAKE US GODS, which shall go before us; for as for this
Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, WE WOT NOT
WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM.

How often Christians also say or feel, "WE WOT NOT WHAT IS BECOME OF GOD!
WE HAVE PRAYED, BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER. THEREFORE, WE HAD TO FIND SOME
OTHER MEANS..."

There was a time when Saul did not know what had become of Samuel; he did
not come in the set time; so Saul took upon himself the privileges of the
priesthood, and turned to the flesh. In the same manner, in prayer, many
give up on God when He appears to be silent or when He delays. They turn
to the flesh in the same manner as Sarah commanded Abraham to turn to
Hagar, the Egyptian. MULTITUDES OF CHURCHES TODAY HAVE GIVEN UP ON PRAYER
AND ARE TURNING TOWARD THE GOLDEN CALF OF BUSINESS MARKETING AND
COMPROMISE. This "golden" calf is a Satanic imitation of true faith! The
true gold, will not give up on KNOCKING in prayer. What ever happened to
PRAYER in our churches? It has been replaced by cupcakes, Super Bowl,
candy, TV, Hollywood, etc.

When Jesus comes will He find faith on earth? In other words, will He find
Christians with an active FAITH IN GOD on earth?:

Mark 11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, HAVE FAITH IN GOD.

Will He not rather find many Christians with faith in SELF and in this
world? Will we not find many Christians who have grown angry and bitter at
God because He dared to test them by His silence? Will they not accuse Him
and His old-fashioned ways of being no longer APPLICABLE? Of being stale
in a modern culture?:

Mark 4:38 And HE WAS IN THE HINDER PART OF THE SHIP, ASLEEP ON A PILLOW:
and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, CAREST THOU NOT that we
perish?

Let us not accuse God for TRYING OUR FAITH. Let us rather accuse ourselves
that we have so soon given up on prayer in our private lives and in our
churches. Our people are naked to their own shame (literally). They are
belly dancing, and disco dancing, not MARCHING triumphantly and
reverently. They say, "But we must dance with our sensual garments spotted
by the flesh around the golden calf. We do not know what happened to the
earlier days. But they are long gone. Prayer vigils will not work. We
cannot live in the 1950's. We need to groove to the tune of our times. We
do not need more tears in prayer, we need to learn the latest rap grooves.
God can use it, man."

No, his silence may mean that we need to change some things in our lives.
But it may also mean that the Lord is trying us to see whether their is
faith on earth. To give up on God, and on His ways in the Bible; the ways
that have already been tested and proven, is to worship the idol of self.
In silence, we must repent and knock louder, not turn to worldly
Christians for answers:

"When God seems to close his ear, we must not therefore close our mouths,
but rather cry with more earnestness..." (Spurgeon)

"God loves importunate prayer so much that He will not give us much
blessing without it." (Adoniram Judson)

I will close with a final proof text to show that the Lord will try our
faith by silence. Do we really want conversions? Do we really want
revival? Do we really desire backsliders to return? Do we really want a
blessing on our preaching? Must we have it? Do we have other options if
God is silent? Notice how the Lord dealt with the poor woman of Canaan:

Matthew 15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David;
my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
23 BUT HE ANSWERED HER NOT A WORD. And his disciples came and besought
him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.
25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread,
and to cast it to dogs.
27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
from their masters' table.
28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, GREAT IS THY FAITH: be
it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that
very hour.

Why was her faith said to be strong? Because, she did not let silence turn
her away from her need. She had confidence in Jesus, not her self. We live
in an age when pastors and churches are giving up on the old, proven
paths. "God is not answering those ways any longer. We have gone to Him,
and He answered us not a word. God blesses those who help themselves. You
will be wise to give up on such prayer before you run off the people you
have left." THREE TIMES our Lord rejected this needy woman. And when she
kept knocking, our Lord used her as an example of STRONG FAITH. But He
assures us that the Laodicean Queen will not dare to be humiliated by
silence. She is in need of nothing. She has learning and money and energy.
She is appalled at the idea of God "testing" people by silence. HER God
would never do such a thing, and risk hurting someone's self esteem.

Let us come out from among this lukewarm crowd and get back to the glories
of old-time religion. Let them mock. Let them despise us. Let them dance
naked around the golden calf. We will pray for them, and for God to have
mercy on all of us, for we all have failed Him in this age. We must not
simply separate. This will make us vain. We must separate and pray. We
need God like never before. Let us honor God by having faith like gold,
that will survive the fires of His silence AND KEEP KNOCKING until the
answer comes:

Luke 11:8 ...because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many
as he needeth.
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; KNOCK, and it shall be opened unto you.

************************************************
ZAMBIAN PASTOR AVAILABLE FOR MEETINGS
************************************************
Barney Milunga, a pastor from Zambia, Africa, is visiting with us for a
few weeks. If you live near Texas, we can arrange to have him speak in
your church. You will be glad you had him. God is sending these
missionaries from Africa to America to give us the Gospel and teach us
about religion. This pastor is the real thing. He thinks he is coming to
America to learn, and he does not realize how much he brings to us. In a
land where they eat some type of corn mush a few times a day, and there
are no desserts, and only rich people drink sodas, God was bound to raise
up some soldiers with deep insight into yteh Scriptures. Barney is
burdened that TBN is deceiving multitudes of pastors in his land into the
prosperity, "name it and claim it" gospel. He has built a strong church by
laboring at soul winning, twelve hours a day, eating only at night,
continually. Christians are seeking to come from other countries to see
his work. He is quiet, shy, but full of power and insight. You can be a
blessing to him, and I know he will be a blessing to your church. His last
message to our church was upon using the law to convert certain proud
sinners, so they will be ready to hear the Gospel of grace. If you would
like to schedule a Wednesday or Sunday meeting (or some other day) for
your church, e-mail me at pastor@kingdombaptist.org or call 817 453-5542.
He will only be in this country a few weeks, so do not delay.

HOLLYWOOD JESUS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
*********************************************
"You got struck by lightning? Oh, yeah. We were shooting the Sermon on the
Mount. About four seconds before it happened it was quiet, and then it was
like someone slapped my ears. I had seven or eight seconds of, like, a
pink, fuzzy color, and people started screaming. They said I had fire on
the left side of my head and light around my body." (Newsweek)

*************************************************************
HOLLYWOOD JESUS CUSSES DURING MOCK CRUCIFIXION
*************************************************************
"I looked over at the guy, and I probably said the F word." (Newsweek)

1 Peter 2:23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he
suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
righteously:

**********************************************************************
HOLLYWOOD JESUS: "GO TO CONFESSION AND ATTEND HOLY MASS"!
**********************************************************************
"If James Caviezel didn't get a part in Terrence Malick's 1998 film 'The
Thin Red Line,' he was going to give up acting. He took his grandmother's
rosary to his audition at Malick's house, and gave it to Malick's maid
after learning she lost a rosary blessed by Mother Theresa. Caviezel
eventually got the part of Pvt. Witt in the film. Coincidence? Caviezel
doesn't think so. Caviezel spoke about his faith at the King's College
commencement ceremony Sunday. The actor urged the Catholic college's
graduating seniors to 'make a commitment to pray, fast, go to confession
and attend holy Mass...'"

************************************************************************
GULLIBLE CHRISTIANS FLOCK TO SEE RATED R "JESUS" MOVIE WITH LEWD CAST
MEMBERS
************************************************************************
Most of the following facts were reported in the FBIS:

MONICA BELLUCCI, the actress who plays Mary Magdalene in The Passion of
The Christ, posed for the 2001 GQ Italia Totally Nude calendar. She has
'starred' in a pornographic movie featuring sodomy, rape, etc.

ROSITA CELENTANO, who plays Satan, has made pornographic photos.

CLAUDIA GERINI, who plays Pilate's wife, has made pornographic photos.

MAIA MORGENSTERN, who plays Mary, the mother of Jesus, starred in a
filthy, lewd, 1997 movie entitled Witman fiuk.

JAMES CAVIEZEL, who plays Jesus, is a Catholic who has starred in
multiple, rated R movies, with profanity, violence, sexual content, etc. A
review for Angel Eyes, a film he starred in, states: "Dreamy James
Caviezel should be a big plus for the ladies..." In regard to the
"Passion" movie, Caviezel states, "I was freezing in that loincloth..."
(Newsweek).

With such a cast of lost, unseemly characters, I can only suppose that the
following conversation will soon be occurring in churches all across our
land:
 
SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER: Little Sally, who is your favorite actress or
actor?

LITTLE SALLY: Oh, I just love Monica Bellucci, who played Mary Magdalene!
I am buying up everything I can find by her. She is really a very
influential role model for my life. I want to be just like her!

SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER: What about you, Jennifer? Who is YOUR favorite
movie star?

JENNIFER: Oh teacher, I have fallen in love with Jim Caviezel! I have his
posters all over my room. He is REALLY dreamy! I am collecting his earlier
movie videos. He has really given me a new appreciation for Jesus, if you
know what I mean.

************************************************************************
IT'S HERE!: BIG, SILVER SCREEN REPLACES BIG, BLACK BIBLE FOR SUNDAY
SERVICE!
************************************************************************
Two churches, at least, have went ahead and jumped wholly into the fire.
There are many other churches that talk about movies so much on a Sunday
that they should go ahead and have "service" at the theater, too! Jesus
wants us hot or cold (Revelation 3:16). If the pulpit is out of touch, and
out of date, THEN GET DOWN TO THE THEATER ON SUNDAY and turn it into a
religious, Lord's day service! Replace the pulpit and the big, black Bible
with the big, silver screen!:

"Two Churches Hold Post-'Passion' Services - GREENWICH, Conn. - Two
churches in Mel's town held services beneath the big screen after seeing
his new movie, 'The Passion of the Christ.' More than 400 members of
Trinity Church and Stanwich Congregational Church crowded into a theater
for a Sunday afternoon screening. A small white crucifix was set up
beneath the movie screen. 'After the film there will be a time of
reflection,' said Ian Cron, Trinity's senior pastor. 'It will be a chance
for us just to sit in the afterglow of the film, if you will.' Filmgoers
also were offered the chance to celebrate the Eucharist, The Greenwich
Time reported...After the film in Greenwich, a guitarist and violinist
played as the Rev. Neely Towe, pastor of Stanwich Congregational Church,
blessed the Eucharist..." (AP, March 2, 2004)

********************************************************
TWO DEVILS UNITE: CATHOLICISM AND HOLLYWOOD
********************************************************
Pilate and Herod made friends and united like never before, in crucifying
Jesus Christ:

Luke 23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for
before they were at enmity between themselves.

Wise Bible teachers have predicted over a century ago that the day would
come when most professing Christians would merge with Rome. Billy Graham,
Promise Keepers, lordship salvationists, and many others, have been
removing barriers between evangelicals and Catholics over the years. But
nothing has united Rome and Christians like the latest Gibson film!
Catholic books, etc. are showing a record increase in sales. And the
justification and perfuming of Gibson's Catholicism by Christians is
frightening and amazing. For example, one man recently sent me an e-mail
that read:

"...While I believe your statements on Roman Catholicism are valid, this
movie does not teach anything about works. 'It is FINISHED.' This is one
of the last statements written on the screen as well as the showing of the
resurrection then the movie ends. Lastly, in an interview with Mel Gibson
he said he was a 'Believer.' If what he says is true than you should be
prepared to spend eternity with him (a Catholic) as well...."

This brother sent a kind enough e-mail. However, he is a perfect example
of the mad attempt to justify this movie. Why is there such an effort to
grab at every little word that might someone show that this cursing, Roman
Catholic, foul-mouthed movie star, who has played in gory movies for
years, might somehow be a "believer"? I do hope that Gibson gets truly
saved, and delivered from his false religion of salvation by works,
sacraments, etc. But this devil-inspired spirit in many Christians today,
that wags its tongue and slobbers at the feet of Hollywood, waiting for a
little "Christian" treat to justify their addiction to ungodly movies, is
truly pathetic.

Now that so many Christians have rewarded these Catholics with their
money, we can be sure that a whole train of new movies will be made to
capitalize on their addiction. They will start with increasing amounts of
gory violence, and a bit of immodesty, and will no doubt grow to contain a
bit of profanity, etc. Christians will flock to see these new "religious"
movies, not realizing that the Devil is using them to adorn Romanism in
the minds of the masses. They will think that Hollywood's new fascination
with religion is a SIGN OF HOLY REVIVAL. It will only be a sign that a
Satanic spirit, preparing the way for ANTICHRIST is sweeping our land.
There is already a mad defiance among many Baptists. They write things to
the effect of: "I took my little children to see this Gibson movie. I
could not resist it. I HAD to see it. Yes I did. I didn't even see it
first, before I took my children. I trust the Christian leaders. We just
marched right on in, and I SHOWED MY CHILDREN THE GORE. Yes I did. And I
will do it again. I will. You can't stop me. I ate popcorn, too. I hate
you. I love Mel Gibson. I see all his movies. He is a believer." Now this
type of language can only be explained by spirits (see 1Timothy 4). There
are spirits operating on the minds of some saints, and these spirits are
not being tested. They are powerful. They need to be tested and rebuked.
Brethren, wake up, and let us learn to walk the pilgrim walk. Let us not
marvel at the harlots of the hour (Rev. 17). These idols will perish.
Gibson's movie is a sign of apostasy, not revival. What will these
Christians do when Harry Potter books start mentioning Christianity. Will
this mean that Rowling is now "a believer"?:

Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man
looketh well to his going.

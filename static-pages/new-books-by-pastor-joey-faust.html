<p align="JUSTIFY">A look at the modern 2012 mania, as well as the history of various cults and so-called end of the world hysteria, proving that literal interpretation is linked to sobriety - unlike figurative interpretation!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As times grow increasingly perilous, many are embracing New-Age, pagan predictions. Others are wrongly setting specific dates for the end of the world based on their interpretations of the Bible (2012, etc.). These errors are setting the stage for the fulfillment of 2 Peter 3:3 ("Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.") As fanaticism and mysticism abound, many are racing to the opposite extreme as they blame and mock Biblical literalism. Actually, many have attempted to link many of the worst tragedies and delusions of history to the literal interpretation of the Bible. This book sets the record straight! The world will not end this year. But Jesus may return at any moment! This tension between these two statements is resolved in this book.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">THE WORD: GOD WILL KEEP IT - THE 400 YEAR HISTORY OF THE KING JAMES BIBLE ONLY MOVEMENT</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-word-god-will-keep-it-e1345519952189.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3026 imgborder" title="the-word-god-will-keep-it-e1345519952189" src="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-word-god-will-keep-it-e1345519952189.jpg" alt="" /></a> This book takes you on a journey through the past four centuries to behold the vast number of Christians that believed the King james Bible is the infallible, preserved Word of God. Many of these early Christians also warned future generations of the terrible consequences that would arise as a result of forsaking this Holy Bible – Consequences that our age has seen come to pass. This book also exposes a web of occultists and false teachers – outside, as well as inside, Christian churches – that have worked to overthrow the faith of multitudes in the King James Bible.</p>

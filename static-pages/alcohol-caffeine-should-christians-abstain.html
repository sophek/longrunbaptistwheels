        <h1>ALCOHOL & CAFFEINE: SHOULD CHRISTIANS ABSTAIN? - KAU#019</h1>

            <blockquote>â€œCoffee uses up the B vitamins...Sugar and alcohol destroy the B-complex vitamins.â€
(Nutrition Almanac, McGraw-Hill)</blockquote>
In regard to alcohol (fermented wine, liquor, beer, etc.) the Bible commands total abstinence. The Bible does not mention coffee, tea, etc. Yet, it commands moderation and temperance in regard to all wholesome food and drinks. It goes on to especially warn of abusing such things as honey. Where does that leave food and beverages that can actually hurt the Christianâ€™s health such as drinks with caffeine? There are many reasons to exercise great moderation (if not total abstinence) from coffee, tea and colas. But first let us deal with alcohol, the evil substance that perverts the mind and body, destroys marriages and corrupts holiness.

It is a sad commentary upon Christendom that the issue of alcohol even has to be debated. Those Christians who have lived a life of revelry know first hand how devilish and deceptive the substance really is. However, many Christians view alcohol like they view Hollywood movies with nudity, cussing and other perversions. They simply do not see the danger in it. They are unaware of how it desensitizes them to the things of God. Let us answer the common objections modern Christians raise in regard to BOOZE:

1. But Jesus obviously drank wine since they called him a winebibber:
<blockquote>Matthew 11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.Â 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</blockquote>
John certainly did not have a devil. It was a lie they made up about him. Jesus certainly was not gluttonous. That was also a lie. Jesus did not abuse food and He did not drink ANY beverage too much. And here is where we get to the real point. Wine is not always alcoholic or fermented in the Bible. It would be sinful to sit around all day eating and drinking even wholesome food! A winebibber would be someone who was abusing wine period. Wine is not necessarily fermented. The accusation could easily be speaking of the over-indulgence of standard food and drink. Yet, it was a lie. Jesus did not eat or drink too much. And it is a FACT that He did not drink fermented wine!

2. Where does the Bible teach that WINE is also a word for unfermented juice?
<blockquote>Isaiah 65:8 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</blockquote>
There it is. Now you can read your King James Bible and rightly divide the Word. Here in Isa. 65 there is something called WINE that is found IN the cluster. It is on the VINE. You do not find fermented juice on a grape vine! Obviously a Christian must examine the context where the word WINE is found. At the time the King James Bible was translated WINE had two meanings.

The same thing can be seen in the ancient Greek language as well. Papias, when describing the blessings of the future Millennial reign on earth states:
<blockquote>â€œ...vines will grow each with . . . ten thousand clusters on each twig, and ten thousand grapes in each cluster, and each grape, when crushed, will yield twenty-five jars of wine [oinos].â€</blockquote>
Notice Papias used the word oinos just like the KJV translators used the word wine. It can describe the unfermented juice of grapes or the fermented juice.

3. This must be a mistake in the KJV. English dictionaries define WINE as fermented juice.

To start with, the KJV played a large role in defining the English language! Nevertheless, it is not true that dictionaries only define WINE as fermented juice. Notice the following:
<blockquote>-Websterâ€™s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary (1989):
Wine: 3. The juice, fermented or unfermented of various other fruits or plants

-A Dictionary Of The English Language, By William G. Webster (1867) and Websterâ€™s Practical Dictionary (1884): Wine: The expressed, and usually the fermented juice of grapes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary (1948) and Websterâ€™s New International Dictionary (1951): Wine: The fermented, or loosely, the UNFERMENTED juice of any fruit or plant used as a beverage.

-Benjamin Marinâ€™s Lingua Britannica Reformata or A New English Dictionary (1748):  Wine: 1. the juice of the grape. 2. a liquor extracted from other fruits besides the grape. 3. the vapours of wine, as wine disturbs his reason.

-John Kerseyâ€™s, A General English Dictionary (1708): Wine: a liquor made of the juice of grapes or other fruits. Liquor or Liquour, anything that is liquid; Drink, Juice, etc. Must, sweet wine, newly pressed from the grape.

-Websterâ€™s American Dictionary (1828): Must: New wine; wine pressed from the grape but not fermented.</blockquote>
It is therefore clear that in English WINE can be used for pure, unfermented juice. This was very common in older English. Yet, the definition can still be found in modern dictionaries today as shown above. The KJV clearly PROVES that it uses the word in a dual sense (Isa.65:8) and many English dictionaries (as well as works of literature, histories etc.) confirm the dual use of the word.

4. But what proof is there that Jesus did not drink fermented wine?

You ought to be ashamed for asking! Nevertheless, Jesus was KING from His birth (Mtt.2:2, 21:5, 27:11). The Bible commands kings not to drink wine at all:
<blockquote>Proverbs 31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</blockquote>
Christians are also kings:
<blockquote>Revelation 1:6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</blockquote>
It therefore follows that Jesus did not drink wine at all. Neither should any Christian.

5. But can you show a DIRECT command against Christians drinking (fermented) wine?
<blockquote>Proverbs 23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.</blockquote>
Unless you can prove you are allowed to drink fermented wine moderately WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED this is a direct command against drinking it! Notice now how absurd it is to conclude that Christ made fermented wine for the guests at that wedding in Cana! Alcohol is one of the chief causes of divorce. Imagine the insanity of concluding that the God of the universe who hates PUTTING AWAY (Mal.2:16) would sanctify alcohol at a WEDDING! Furthermore, the very context refutes such a preposterous idea:
<blockquote>John 2:10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.Â 11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</blockquote>
Notice the words WELL DRUNK! We are to believe that Christ, for His FIRST miracle, gets everyone WELL DRUNK on fermented wine?! No! These guests were not TIPSY. They were intellectually coherent and focused. The disciples BELIEVED on Christ.

6. But the wine had to be fermented because the Jews did not know how to preserve it without it fermenting.

This is another falsehood. Modern man in his arrogance is always quick to underestimate ancient man. The Popular And Critical Bible Encyc. (1914) states:
<blockquote>-The word sirup, it may be remarked is derived from an Oriental term for wine; hence in Turkey, shirab-jee signifies wine-seller. This species of wine is still called honey in the East...Yahâ€™yin [Heb.] is also used for grapes or for wine in the cluster in Jer.xl:10,12...In this sense Josephus (De Bell.Jud.vii) employs the Greek equivalent when he enumerates among the stores in the fortress of Massada, flour, wine and oil, and adds that the Romans found remains of these fruits UNCORRUPTED...Yahâ€™yin signifies also the blood of the grape freshly expressed. In Prov.9:2,5 yahâ€™yin refers to a boiled wine or sirup, the thickness of which rendered it necessary to mingle water with it previously to drinking.-</blockquote>
From Josephus we see that the Jews had great skill at preserving fruits (wine) and other foods so they would not spoil (ferment, etc.). One way they kept juice from spoiling was to boil it down into a grape honey or syrup. Then, when they wished to drink it, they mixed it with water. STRONG DRINK in the Bible can be fermented or unfermented. If the wine syrup is mixed with only a little water it is strong. If it is mixed with much water it is weak. (When you go to the grocery store you will see orange juice advertised: â€œnot from concentrateâ€. This means it is STRONG DRINK.)

There were also many other ways they knew of preserving juice from fermentation. Samuele Bacchiocchi (Wine In The Bible) writes:
<blockquote>â€œBy boiling, the water of the grape juice evaporates, yeasts and molds are destroyed, and the sugar content increases, thus inhibiting yeast growth. This method of preserving grape juice unfermented by carefully boiling it down to a syrup was commonly and successfully used in the ancient world. When desired, the syrup would be drunk diluted with water. Several sources confirm this practice.â€</blockquote>
He quotes Pliny to prove that ancients knew how to preserve grapes:
<blockquote>â€œPliny, a Roman scholar and naturalist...briefly describes in his Natural History other methods used to preserve grapes: â€˜Some grapes will last all through the winter if the clusters are hung by a string from the ceiling, and others will keep merely in their own natural vigor by being stood in earthenware jars with casks put over them, and packed round with fermenting grape-skins.â€™"</blockquote>
The Imperial Bible Dictionary describes another method of ancient preservation:
<blockquote>â€œ...great care had to be taken whenever the must was to be preserved; and the neglect of precautions would be followed by fermentation. One of those precautions was to put young wine into new skins (Mtt.9:17) not (as some have imagined) to let it ferment there, for new skins and old skins would be alike powerless to resist the forces generated in that process) but in order to exclude all air and at the same time have inside no remains of old fermented substances.â€</blockquote>
If the ancients knew how to keep alcohol from turning into vinegar they knew how to keep juice from turning into alcohol! Vinegar is the last and final state.

6. But the NT says to drink wine in moderation; it does not teach total abstinence.

Notice the verses this objection is referring to:
<blockquote>Titus 2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;

1 Timothy 3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

1 Timothy 5:23 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.</blockquote>
The above verses are certainly teaching MODERATION. The problem for modern boozers is that they are teaching moderation in regard to UNFERMENTED grape juice! Now this is something. The Biblical command is to go easy on the orange juice; yet modern Christians are debating about Mad Dog 20/20!

7. But why would the Bible say to drink fruit juice in moderation?!

For the same reason it says not to be a glutton in regard to food. To eat too much is expensive and unhealthy. Christians should strive to do the most with their money; they should also strive to have as much healthy energy as possible. Notice what the Bible says about honey:
<blockquote>Proverbs 25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

Proverbs 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</blockquote>
We have seen that the word HONEY (even in English) can refer to the stuff we get from bees OR the juice that one gets from fruits. (Nu.13:27?) Nevertheless, even if Proverbs is referring only to the honey that comes from bees, it would still teach moderation in various juices (especially of the grape). Nutritionists have shown that an OVER USE of sweets such as refined sugar, honey, grape juice, etc. can lead to all types of health problems. Certainly honey and fruit juices are healthier than refined sugar; nevertheless, these can even be harmful in abundance.

It appears that among other things, abusing sweets can mess up blood sugar:
<blockquote>â€œCarbohydrate snacks containing sugars and starches provide the body with almost instant energy because they cause a sudden rise in blood sugar level. However, the blood sugar level drops again rapidly, creating a craving for more sweet food and possibly fatigue, dizziness, nervousness, and headache.â€
(Nutrition Almanac, McGraw-Hill)</blockquote>
This will tempt the Christian to be cranky, irritable and moody. Christians are tempted enough in regard to such things! No wonder the Bible says to go easy on healthy sweets (honey, juices, etc.)! (Where does that leave unhealthy sweets?)

In light of the topic at hand, caffeine is also seen to cause the same problems. While grape juice has much value in moderation, we know caffeine has no value at all. This is why so many early evangelists preached against it. Finney asks, â€œDo you deny yourself even the hurtful superfluities of life, such as tea, coffee, and tobacco?â€ Lester Roloff has likewise stated, â€œPeople ask me, â€˜Well, why don't you drink coffee, tea, or soft drinks?â€™ I would like to ask, â€˜Why do you drink them? Is there a health reason for it?â€™ Now, I'm interested in being healthy because of the call of God upon my life. There's no demand for a sick body. People ask, â€˜Don't you like them?â€™ Why, of course, I like them and until sixteen years ago, I drank and indulged in all of these things, but let me remind you that it was back in my sick days.â€™ â€

There are many good nutrition and health books that document the dangers of eating too much sweets. Thus, the modern study of nutrition confirms the Bibleâ€™s ancient wisdom: Eat a LITTLE honey and drink a LITTLE grape-juice!

Yet, notice the following nutrition article on caffeine and notice how it can cause the same problems as refined sweets:
<blockquote>â€œDay by day scientists are coming to an increased appreciation of the importance of proper blood sugar levels to good health...The way low blood sugar (hypoglycemia or hyperinsulinism...) comes about is this. When sugar is eaten, it goes almost immediately to the blood because it does not need to be digested. This raises the blood sugar to an abnormal height. But instead of staying at this height, the blood sugar level plunges almost immediately to far below what it should be. Then the individual feels uncomfortable, tired or hungry and eats something else that is sugary or starchy. His blood sugar level soars again, only to drop far below what it should be a half hour or an hour later. You can see such a condition produces a vicious cycle...The ideal blood sugar level is one which rises a little after a meal, when the body is busy digesting the food eaten, then falls gradually just a little and levels off in a plateau, falling down just a little again before it is time for the next meal.

White sugar and products made from it are among the worst offenders in producing low blood sugar. A second criminal in the low blood sugar case is tobacco, for puffing on a cigarette has the same effect of lifting the blood sugar level, only to plunge it to dangerous depths within half an hour or so. The third offender is - youâ€™ve guessed it- coffee...Quite apart from the effect on heart, breathing, blood pressure and so forth, coffee causes the blood sugar to rise rapidly then fall just as rapidly. So, if you suffer from low blood sugar, the effects of those 3 cups of breakfast coffee will wear off in an hour or so, and you will find your efficiency decreasing. Your head may begin to ache, you may get grumpy and irritable, you may have an all-gone feeling in the pit of your stomach, you may be just plain hungry. Obviously itâ€™s time for you to have another cup of coffee. You do and the cycle begins all over again. Folks who take their morning cup of coffee and donâ€™t run into any of these difficulties apparently have a sugar-regulating mechanism strong enough to bring up the blood sugar level after the drop occurs. These are the folks who work vigorously and well straight through the morning and feel just pleasantly hungry by lunch time. Nine chances out of ten they wonâ€™t feel the need for coffee at lunch. With their blood sugar level holding steady throughout the afternoon, they wonâ€™t need a coffee-break at the office around three oâ€™clock...What about the coffee-addict, who has 3 or more cups for breakfast, another at 10 A.M., several more for lunch and dinner...? His blood sugar level must be zigging and zagging all day, from depths to heights. The main reason for the low blood sugar is the coffee he drinks and the lower the blood sugar goes, the more coffee he must have to bring it up again! Truly a vicious cycle!â€Â (The Complete Book Of Food And Nutrition, J.I. Rodale)</blockquote>
The article goes on to suggest a diet high in protein but low in sugars and starches. He recommends avoiding caffeine, candy, etc.

Many nutrition articles could be cited to add additional testimony to the Bibleâ€™s commands to drink fruit juice and eat honey moderately. But why an article like this in the KA Update? For one, many Christians fall into even greater sin than their drunkenness (which is dangerous enough), when they deceive themselves into messing with alcohol. Marriages are destroyed and testimonies are ruined. But why bother with coffee and tea, etc.? The command to eat only a little honey is a command of wisdom. The NT command to drink grape juice moderately is also great wisdom. These things no doubt go much further than many imagine. The Bible is written by God who made man! There are many who are grumpy and irritable. They are addicted to coffee, tea or sweets. They literally cannot function without them. They try to get in a good mood but it is a hard battle. They are continually snappy, miserable and depressed. They do not realize their battle would be much, much easier if they would absolutely abstain from caffeine or refined sugars! Many say that they would not be able to function during the day without such things. The truth is, they will never be able to function without such things unless they abstain from them and allow their sugar to stabilize!

In my past I have been a terrible abuser of coffee, colas and tea because I felt I could not function without them. Since I have totally abstained from caffeine my memory has returned and I do not have energy crashes. This makes it much easier to be less grumpy in life. Who would have ever guessed that the way to get the most efficient energy out of a day was to abstain from things that are unhealthy and eat right?

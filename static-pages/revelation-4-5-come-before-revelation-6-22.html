            REVELATION 4 & 5 COME BEFORE REVELATION 6-22
The Seals, Trumpets and Vials of Revelation 6-19 that lead up to the coming of Christ to this earth to defeat Antichrist follow AFTER the events of Rev.4 and 5. Many point out that the Apostle John is "caught up" in Rev.4:1:

Re 4:1 Â¶ After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be
hereafter.

They say that this proves that Christians will be raptured before the Seals of Rev.6. I DO believe John is a picture of this rapture (at least of the Christians that "lean on Jesus' breast!" -John 15:14, 21:20, 1Jn.2:28). Yet, pictures only enhance the literal prophecies. Therefore, there must be more in the Bible to show there will be a rapture of saints before the Tribulation period. For King James Bible believers, this proof is abundant. Notice how the KJV reads in Rev.5:8-10:

Re 5:8 And when he had taken the book, the four BEASTS and four and twenty ELDERS fell down before the LAMB, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.
9 And THEY sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and
to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed US to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 10 And hast made US unto our God KINGS and PRIESTS: and WE shall reign on the earth.

In the KJV, notice the words "they" and "us" in verses 9 and 10. New bible versions usually translate these words "men" and "them". This forces one to interpret the 4 Beasts and 24 Elders as Cherubims and Angels. Why do new bibles make such a change? First they are written by men who are prejudiced against the KJV (or any final, written authority for that matter) and look for any reason to prove it is faulty. They therefore see the ugly word "beast" and quickly pounce upon it as an example of the KJV's immature crudeness. They see that the 4 Beasts resemble (though not exactly) the "Living Creatures" of Ezekiel 1:5. They therefore translate the 4 "Beasts" as "Living Creatures". Now, having made them to be Cherubims
(Ezek.10:19,20) they realize they run into doctrinal problems in Rev.5:9.
Knowing that it would be ridiculous to conclude that CHERUBIMS were
redeemed from among men by the Blood of Jesus, they must find a way out of
their dilemma. What do they do? They run to their two hero manuscripts,
Sinaiticus and Vaticanus! It does not matter to them that these manuscripts
represent a small minority. They use them whenever they desire to change
something. But oops! Not this time. It is a fact that ALL of the
manuscripts contain the "us" in verse 9. Only the Ethiopic PARAPHRASE and
the Codex Alexandrinus change it. Even Tregelles decided that there was no evidence for changing the "us" on the basis of just one manuscript. And
this was BEFORE the Codex Sinaiticus appeared with the "us" intact (1860),
just at it appears in the KJV. Now all of this is relatively boring to a
KJV Bible believer. We spend time worrying about what the Bible "means". We already know what it "says". Yet, I just wanted to show that even based on their own arguments, and their own methodologies, modern textual critics
have no valid reason for rejecting the "us" in Rev.5:9.

The 4 Beasts and 24 Elders are figures for raptured Christians. The Lord has already come to translate them because they are in glory with crowns (Rev.4:10). No crowns are given until Christ's appearing:

2Ti 4:8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

1Pe 5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

Furthermore, these translated saints have already been judged, and they ALL already know they will REIGN with Christ on earth:

Re 5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign
on the earth.

Christ had to appear to rapture these watching saints, since there is no
such judgment until His appearing (1Cor.4:5).

It therefore follows that we have, beyond a doubt, a picture of translated, faithful saints (who will reign on earth) BEFORE the 1st Seal is opened in Rev.6:1.

Is not this interpreting the Bible figuratively? No. Literal interpretation does not mean that we do not recognize symbols. It means that we do not try to fit modern events into the Bible's prophecies by "spiritualizing" those
prophecies. It also means that we do not immediately conclude something is
a symbol without clear evidence. Now notice the context of the 4 BEASTS and 24 ELDERS:

Re 5:8 And when he had taken the book, the four BEASTS and four and twenty ELDERS fell down before the LAMB, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of ODOURS, which are the prayers of saints.

Notice that in the context of the Beasts and Elders is a LAMB. Does anyone believe that we will see a literal lamb in glory when we behold Christ? Of course not! John is seeing a vision that is communicating literal truth. If the Lamb is a figure, then why not the Beasts and Elders? Furthermore, notice the "vials full of odours". They are not "odours" at all. "Odours" is only a figure for "the prayers of saints". Throughout the Book of
Revelation we see the Devil pictured as a DRAGON and literal cities
pictured as WOMEN. The Holy Spirit said the Book of Revelation would use
symbols in the very first verse of the Book:

Re 1:1 Â¶ The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and SIGNIFIED it by his angel unto his servant John:

Does not this give us a reason to take the various plagues in the Book of Revelation as symbolic? No. We have a CLEAR reason to take the 4 Beasts and 24 Elders as symbolic. They are said to be redeemed from the earth, from every tribe and tongue and nation. 24 + 4 = 28. There are more than 28 tribes, nations and tongues on planet earth!

Why would the Bible use the word "beasts" for Christians? It is because the word has already been used to describe the 4 Gentile "kings" in Daniel 7:17. The ELDERS are shown as "priests". The number 24 is associated with the priesthood in 1Chron.24. And what does the Book of Revelation itself interpret the Beasts and Elders to be?:

Re 5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 10 And hast made us unto our God KINGS and PRIESTS: and we shall reign on the earth.

"Beasts" and "Elders" speak of faithful Christians who are "kings and priests" in Christ in the rapture. The prophetic numbers, the terms, and the way the Beasts and Elders are arrayed, all show forth the Holy Spirit's own interpretation of the symbols in verse 10.

The importance of Rev.4 and 5 is to show that Christ has come to the sky
above earth and has translated His watching saints who will reign on earth. He has fulfilled His promise to keep them from the time of trouble:

Re 3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep
thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

This states positively what is stated negatively at the end of the Book.
Here, the pre-trib translation is based on keeping the Word. This implies that if you do not keep this Word you WILL experience the plagues of the Tribulation period. And this is EXACTLY what is stated at the end of the Book:

Re 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.
18 For I testify unto EVERY MAN that heareth the words of the prophecy of
this book, If ANY MAN shall ADD UNTO these things, God shall add unto him
the plagues that are written in this book:

No man can experience the plagues that are written in the Book of
Revelation unless he goes through the Tribulation period where they will be
found. Again, we have an implied promise of protection from the plagues. Yet, neither Israel, nor the vast multitude of Gentiles will be protected from ALL the plagues:

Re 7:14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the
sun light on them, nor any heat.

Notice verse 16. This group that is finally saved out of the Trib has
experienced the plague of the 4th Trumpet (and the 4th Seal of Rev.6:8). The promises of Rev.3;10 and 22:18 are clear. There will be a pre-trib translation that will protect a certain group from ALL the plagues. Again, this is exactly what Christ has taught before:

Lu 21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape ALL THESE THINGS that shall come to pass, and to stand
before the Son of man.

The idea of Irvin Baxter Jr. that we escape all these things by DEATH is
absurd. Christ is commanded us that we pray to be accounted worthy to
escape these things at His coming (which has two parts). It will be
impossible for Israel to escape ALL the things Christ has mentioned in Luke 21. In fact, it is Luke 21 that expressly teaches that Israel will NOT escape all these things:

Lu 21:22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
written may be fulfilled.
24 And THEY shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

A.D. 70 was only a foretaste of the fulfillment of this prophecy for the
future. No, Israel will indeed experience a large part of the Tribulation plagues (even if a remnant is protected from some of the worst parts of the Great Tribulation as seen in Rev.12). The words of Christ in Luke 21 are to the same people that He spoke John 14:1-3. It is absurd to say that the promises of John 14 are not to Israel, but then conclude that Luke 21:36 (one of the strongest verses on the pre-trib rapture in the entire Bible) is to Israel IN the Trib.

There are other strong verses that teach a pre-trib rapture in the Bible. But I will rest my case with these today. My purpose for this article is to establish that, just as Enoch was "translated that he should NOT SEE DEATH" (Heb.11:5), so shall faithful Christians be saved from the wrath of the Tribulation temptation. As long as the rapture of Rev.4 and 5 has not yet occurred, we can be certain that the events of Rev.6-19 have not yet
occurred. It will be the rapture of all the "restraining" Christians that
will help bring forth the terrible calamities of the Tribulation age. There will be no large body left to oppose evil. Therefore, it will increase rapidly in the void that is left. The world will panic as babies are most likely taken off the earth. In the turmoil, the Arab nations in the Middle East will temporarily gain power over the world (and over Israel). This will only be temporary. It will not be long before the Antichrist from Rome establishes a world government and brings about the worst years of the Tribulation age.

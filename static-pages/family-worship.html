        <div id="content">
            "A prayerless family cannot be otherwise than irreligious. They who daily pray in their homes, do well; they that not only pray, but read the Bible, do better; but they do best of all, who not only pray and read the Bible, but sing the praises of God....The influence of family worship is great, silent, irresistible and permanent. Like the calm, deep stream, it moves on in silent, but overwhelming power. It strike sits roots deep into the human heart, and spreads its branches wide over the whole being....It affords home security and happiness, removes family friction, and causes all the complicated wheels of the home-machinery to move on noiselessly and smoothly. It promotes union and harmony, expunges all selfishness, allays petulant feelings and turbulent passions, destroys peevishness of temper, and makes home intercourse holy and delightful. It causes the members to reciprocate each other's affections, hushes the voice of recrimination, and exerts a softening and harmonizing influence over each heart....Its voice has sent many a poor prodigal home to his father's house....The child, kneeling beside the pious mother, and pouring forth its infant prayer to God, must attract the notice of the heavenly host....But in order to do this, the worship must be regular and devout, and the whole family engage in it....It must needs be that trials will enter a household. The conflict of wishes, the clashing of views, and a thousand other causes, will ruffle the temper, and produce jar and friction in the machinery of the family. There is needed then, some daily agency that shall softly enfold the homestead with its hallowed and soothing power, and restore the fine, harmonious play of its various parts. The father needs that which shall gently lift away from his thoughts the disquieting burden of his daily business. The mother that which shall smooth down the fretting irritation of her unceasing toil and trial; and the child and domestic that which shall neutralize the countless agencies of evil that ever beset them....See what home becomes with religion as its life and rule....Compare an irreligious home with this, and see the vast importance of family worship. It is a moral waste; its members move in the putrid atmosphere of vitiated feeling and misdirected power. Brutal passions become dominant; we hear the stern voice of parental despotism; we behold a scene of filial strife and insubordination....Domestic life becomes clouded by a thousand crosses and disappointments; the solemn realities of the eternal world are cast into the shade...the sense of moral duty distorted....Natural affection is debased, and love is prostituted to the base designs of self....Let yours, therefore, be a religious home; and then be sure that God will delight to dwell therein, and His blessing will descend, like the dews of heaven, upon it....And then in the dark hour of home separation and bereavement, when the question is put to you mourning parents, 'Is it well with the child? is it well with thee?' you can answer with joy, 'It is well!'" (1882)

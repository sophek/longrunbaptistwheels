SHOULD WE PROTEST SIN? BALANCING THE TWO SIDES OF SALT
*****************************************************************

Jeremiah 11:6 Then the LORD said unto me, PROCLAIM ALL THESE WORDS in the
cities of Judah, and IN THE STREETS of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the
words of this covenant, and do them.
7 For I EARNESTLY PROTESTED unto your fathers in the day that I brought
them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, RISING EARLY AND
PROTESTING, saying, Obey my voice.
8 Yet they obeyed not...

"It is fearful to sin; more fearful to delight in sin; yet more to defend
it."
("The Works of Bishop Hall")

Christians should be "salty." We become ineffective if we lose our
"saltiness"; our Lord therefore warns us:

Matthew 5:13 Ye are the SALT OF THE EARTH: but IF THE SALT HAVE LOST HIS
SAVOUR, wherewith shall IT be salted? it is thenceforth GOOD FOR NOTHING,
but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be
hid.
15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not
come to destroy, but to fulfil.
 
Salt has two main purposes or uses:

"Sodium chloride, a widely distributed compound, used by men from time
immemorial as a SEASONING....Its ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES have led to its
general use in preserving organic substances FROM DECAY." ("A Standard
Dictionary of the English Language," 1895)

One way in which we can be "seasoning" is through gracious speech. To be
"salty," we should never allow corrupt communication to proceed out of
mouths:

Ephesians 4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister GRACE unto
the hearers.

Bitter gossip, sinful jesting, slander, cussing, immoral conversations,
complaining, backbiting, etc., are not "salty" speech. We should therefore
be sober, grave, and holy in our speech that we may administer GRACE to
those who hear us:

Titus 2:6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
8 SOUND SPEECH, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary
part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

It is this aspect of "saltiness," referring to salt as a SEASONING, which
is referred to in Colossians:

Colossians 4:6 Let your SPEECH be alway WITH GRACE, SEASONED WITH SALT,
that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

Indeed, truth stings the flesh, and is bitter to man's rebellious nature.
We are commanded to adorn it with holy conduct and gracious speech:

Job 6:6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any
taste in the white of an egg?

Let us remain salty, and never strive with men out of envy, pride or
personal revenge. Let us never come to blows or call names in a sinful,
heady manner:

2 Timothy 2:24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

But many have let the Unitarians and the spirit of the world define
Biblical words such as "meekness" and "gentleness" in a manner, which, if
true, would turn our Saviour and His apostles into HATEFUL SINNERS! The
Bible teaches us that Jesus (and His apostles who follow Him) is our
example to follow:

1 Corinthians 11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

Too much salt on our food will ruin it. The Bible teaches that false
preachers in the last days will promise sinful liberty:

2 Peter 2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they
allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that
were clean escaped from them who live in error.
19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.

They will use great swelling words (Jude 1:16) and will turn the grace of
our Lord into lasciviousness (Jude 1:4). The Bible teaches that MANY shall
follow this sinful spirit (2 Peter 2:2). In fact, the Scriptures teaches
that they will HEAP to themselves teachers which will be devoid of sound
doctrine. Truth will be replaced by FABLES, baited with "good words and
fair speeches":

Romans 16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
their own belly; and BY GOOD WORDS AND FAIR SPEECHES deceive the hearts of
the simple.

2 Timothy 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
after their own lusts shall they HEAP to themselves teachers, having
ITCHING EARS;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto FABLES.

It is therefore important that we notice that SALT also has ANTISEPTIC,
PRESERVATIVE properties! The very reason the apostle admonishes us to
PREACH THE WORD (2 Timothy 4:2) is for the purpose of RESTRAINING. We are
called to OBSTRUCT and HINDER evil as it seeks to spread as leaven through
the whole lump:

2 Thessalonians 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only HE
WHO NOW LETTETH WILL LET [i.e. restrain, hinder], until he be taken out of
the way.

The apostle often speaks of "he" in a generic sense, meaning "any man" or
"any Christian" (i.e. Galatians 6:8). Therefore, it matters little whether
the "hinderer" in 2 Thessalonians 2 speaks of individual Christians, or of
the Holy Spirit's PRESERVING WORK in these Christians. The point is that
the pre-tribulation rapture will one day remove the SALTY CHRISTIANS from
this Earth. Notice the RESTRAINING aspect of RIGHTEOUS SAINTS:

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as
keep the law CONTEND WITH THEM.

The Bible teaches that the unrighteous (saved or unsaved) will DESPISE the
righteous in the last days (as Cain hated his brother):

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves...
3 ...DESPISERS OF THOSE THAT ARE GOOD...

They will not contend with the wicked. They will instead contend with the
RIGHTEOUS who are contending with the wicked!:

Amos 5:10 They HATE HIM THAT REBUKETH IN THE GATE, and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightly.

Isaiah 29:21 That MAKE A MAN AN OFFENDER FOR A WORD, and lay a snare for
HIM THAT REPROVETH IN THE GATE, and turn aside the just for a thing of
nought.

They will turn aside the "just" to defend wickedness in the name of
"love"!:

Isaiah 41:6 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
brother, BE OF GOOD COURAGE.

This is NOT "salty" speech in the "restraining" sense. It is "saltiness"
in the sense of tasty, ear-scratching "seasoning" taken to such a degree
that the righteous are hated, despised and rebuked for daring to CONTEND
and RESTRAIN evil. People in the last days will have pleasure in evil:

Romans 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but HAVE PLEASURE IN
THEM that do them.

Christians are not called to merely SEPARATE from evil. They are called to
publicly REPROVE it:

Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, but rather REPROVE THEM.

Noah was not only obedient in separating from the sins of that violent
world. He was also a PREACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS:

2 Peter 2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved NOAH the eighth
person, A PREACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, bringing in the flood upon the world
of the ungodly;
6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them
with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should
live ungodly;

Elijah was accused of "troubling" Israel:

1 Kings 18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said
unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's
house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou
hast followed Baalim.

He was obviously "salty." It is therefore wrong to adopt a "whatever makes
people happy" attitude (2 Chronicles 19:2-3).

Notice that our Lord taught that Christians are the "salt" of the "earth":

Matthew 5:13 Ye are the salt of THE EARTH...

"Salt preserves from corruption. The disciples of Christ preserve the
world from general corruption. Whatever becomes utterly corrupted is
doomed to be destroyed."("People's New Testament Commentary")

John the Baptist did not hide the light of God. He was bold to rebuke the
king for many evils:

Luke 3:18 And many other things in his exhortation PREACHED he unto the
people.
19 But Herod the tetrarch, BEING REPROVED BY HIM for Herodias his brother
Philip's wife, AND FOR ALL THE EVILS which Herod had done,
20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

John was certainly "salty" (in the restraining sense) to the scribes and
Pharisees:

Matthew 3:7  But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
his baptism, he said unto them, O GENERATION OF VIPERS, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?
8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

Jesus Christ praised John, and preached the same salty message of
repentance:

Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

In fact, it was the Lord's direct preaching against sin that most
"offended" the lost Pharisees:

Matthew 15:7 YE HYPOCRITES, well did Esaias prophesy of you...
12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the
Pharisees were OFFENDED, after they heard this saying?
13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath
not planted, shall be rooted up.
14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

The Lord did not cuss or call names out of envy, pride or personal
revenge. However, in order to reprove the world of SIN, He did not mince
any words or hide truth to "win friends and influence people":

John 8:44 YE ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL, and the lusts of your father ye
will do...

Matthew 23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make
him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
16 Woe unto you, ye BLIND GUIDES...
17 YE FOOLS AND BLIND: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple
that sanctifieth the gold?
33 YE SERPENTS, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation
of HELL?

Luke 13:32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and TELL THAT FOX [king Herod],
Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
third day I shall be perfected.

Many today, if they heard Jesus speak and beheld His conduct, would no
doubt dare to tell Jesus Himself, "You should be nice like Jesus. I do not
perceive the love of God in you. You can't win people like this." Notice
the "salty" conduct of our Lord:

John 2:13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem,
14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
the changers of money sitting:
15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of
the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers'
money, and overthrew the tables;
16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not
my Father's house an house of merchandise.

As we have already noticed, the disciples presumptuously attempted to show
the Lord that the Pharisees were "offended" at His words (Matthew 15:12).
How many more would dare to rebuke the Spirit of God today, if they
actually heard Him or saw Him at work!

Why did the world hate our Lord? Jesus tells us plainly why the world
hates Him:

John 7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, BECAUSE I TESTIFY OF
IT, THAT THE WORKS THEREOF ARE EVIL.

Acts 3:26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
BLESS you, IN TURNING AWAY EVERY ONE OF YOU FROM HIS INIQUITIES.

Apparently, our Lord has a different view of "blessing" than many do today
(Psalms 10:3)! And if the Lord's disciples will not lose their saltiness,
and they will also testify to the world that its works are evil (thereby
showing people that they need a Saviour, and hindering the spread of moral
decay), they will ALSO be hated! But if they lose their saltiness, and
refuse to reprove sinners, and refuse to contend against sin, they will be
loved by the world:

Matthew 10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house
Beelzebub, HOW MUCH MORE shall they call them of his household?
27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear
in the ear, that PREACH YE UPON THE HOUSETOPS.
32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess
also before my Father which is in heaven.
33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my
Father which is in heaven.
34 THINK NOT THAT I AM COME TO SEND PEACE ON EARTH: I came not to send
peace, but a sword.

Luke 6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the FALSE prophets.

2 Timothy 3:12 Yea, and all that will LIVE GODLY in Christ Jesus shall
suffer persecution.
13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and
being deceived.

Jesus reproved the world of sin because He was filled with the Holy Spirit
of God:

John 3:34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

Jesus taught that the mission of the Holy Spirit would be to REPROVE THE
WORLD of sin, righteousness and of judgment:

John 16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that
I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
if I depart, I will send him unto you.
8 And when he is come, HE WILL REPROVE THE WORLD OF SIN, AND OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND OF JUDGMENT:
13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into
all truth...

This is what the Old Testament prophets did; this is what John the Baptist
did; this is what Jesus did; and this is what the apostles in the Book of
Acts did!:

Acts 24:24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith
in Christ.
25 And as HE REASONED OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, TEMPERANCE, AND JUDGMENT TO COME,
Felix TREMBLED, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a
convenient season, I will call for thee.

The Bible says that Stephen was filled with the Spirit. Therefore, we find
him salty unto death, reproving the world of sin:

Acts 7:51 YE STIFFNECKED AND UNCIRCUMCISED IN HEART AND EARS, ye do always
RESIST THE HOLY GHOST: as your fathers did, so do ye.
52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have
slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye
have been now the betrayers and murderers:
53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not
kept it.
54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they
gnashed on him with their teeth.
60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this
sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

In meekness, he did not fight with the physical sword. He prayed for his
enemies. But he also REBUKED THESE LOST SINNERS FOR THEIR SINS!

Peter was salty enough to rebuke Simon:

Acts 8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not
right in the sight of God.
22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the
thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond
of iniquity.
24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of
these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

The prayer of these early disciples was for BOLDNESS TO PREACH. How often
do we hear this prayer today?:

Acts 4:29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
servants, that with all BOLDNESS they may speak thy word,

Acts 9:29 And he spake BOLDLY in the name of the Lord Jesus, and DISPUTED
against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.

Paul rebuked a "new-ager" with so much "salt," he would be accused of the
devilish hatred by many "saints" today:

Acts 13:6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found
a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:
7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man;
who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood
them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
9 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, set
his eyes on him,
10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, THOU CHILD OF THE
DEVIL, thou ENEMY of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to PERVERT the
right ways of the Lord?
11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be
blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him
a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the
hand.
12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished
at the doctrine of the Lord.

God, in His wisdom, was sure to tell us that Paul was FILLED in this
instance with the Holy Ghost. He was filled with the Spirit of God which
has been sent into the world to reprove it of sin, exalt righteousness,
and warn of judgment.

Paul rebuked and warned his hypocritical persecutors:

Acts 23:2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth.
3 Then said Paul unto him, GOD SHALL SMITE THEE, THOU WHITED WALL: for
sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten
contrary to the law?

And even though idolatry was the state sanctioned religion, and even
though many made their living through the manufacturing and sale of
images, the apostles rebuked the Gentiles for this horrible sin:

Acts 14:13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city,
brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice
with the people.
14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their
clothes, and ran in among the people, CRYING OUT,
15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like
passions with you, AND PREACH UNTO YOU THAT YE SHOULD TURN FROM THESE
VANITIES unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
and all things that are therein:
16 Who IN TIMES PAST suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
19 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,
supposing he had been dead.
20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came
into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught
many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,

In "times past" God suffered all nations to walk in idolatry and
abominations. But NOW, He commands ALL NATIONS to REPENT. Salvation in
eternity (i.e. legal RELATIONSHIP with God) is through faith alone in the
Gospel. But Paul sought to bring men into FELLOWSHIP with God. This is
through REPENTANCE and TURNING FROM SIN:

Acts 17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his SPIRIT WAS
STIRRED in him, when he saw the city wholly given TO IDOLATRY.
17 Therefore DISPUTED he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the
devout persons, and IN THE MARKET daily with them that met with him.
22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens,
I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
30 And THE TIMES OF THIS IGNORANCE GOD WINKED AT; BUT NOW COMMANDETH ALL
MEN EVERY WHERE TO REPENT:
31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which HE WILL JUDGE the world
in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given
assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

Acts 20:21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, REPENTANCE
TOWARD GOD, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

Jesus certainly dealt with  broken sinners, who were ALREADY CONVICTED in
a compassionate manner. Yet, NEVER was He so compassionate that He excused
sin! He knew how to keep the balance between the two qualities of salt.
Notice how Jesus did not believe always wait to establish a relationship
with people before He reproved them of sin, and admonished them to flee
it:

John 8:10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he
said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man
condemned thee?
11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn
thee: GO, AND SIN NO MORE.

John 4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto
her, Give me to drink.
16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,
Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
18 FOR THOU HAST HAD FIVE HUSBANDS; and he whom thou now hast is not thy
husband: in that saidst thou truly.

Jesus often lifted up His voice in public places:

John 7:28 Then CRIED JESUS in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both
know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, WHOM YE KNOW NOT.

John 12:44 JESUS CRIED and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
me, but on him that sent me.

And Jesus, at times, UPBRAIDED WHOLE CITIES like the fiery prophets of the
Old Testament:

Matthew 11:20 Then began he to UPBRAID THE CITIES wherein most of his
mighty works were done, because they repented not:
21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would
have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at
the day of judgment, than for you.
23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought
DOWN TO HELL: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had
been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
 
How much more shall America, with Bibles and churches on every corner, be
judged for greater sins than Sodom? And where are the preachers? Where are
the men of God who will stand and cry a word of warning like Jonah? Are
not these the days of unholy passivity, where people are "nicer" than
Jesus Himself! And since Jesus was perfect, what does it mean to be
"nicer" than He is? Does it not mean that people are committing the very
sins that He warned us about?:

Luke 6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.

In conclusion, we are not called to go out as the Catholic Crusaders and
force men to "convert" by the sword of Constantine. We are not called to
lift up our voices out of envy, ambition, pride or revenge. This is what
the passage concerning our Lord refers to:

Matthew 12:18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom
my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew
judgment to the Gentiles.
19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in
the streets.
20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast
out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
34 O GENERATION OF VIPERS, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for
out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
 
Any interpretation of verse 19, that does not allow a place for verse 34
is unbalanced and sinful! Spurgeon explains the words in Matthew 19. He
shows that Jesus did not come the first time to PHYSICALLY KILL or seek
worldly, Satanic ambition. This is the day of God's patience. Therefore,
it is the day of WARNING. And woe unto the man of God who does not sound
the trumpet of warning (Ezekiel 3:18). Notice the words of Spurgeon:

"Lest a popular controversy and public tumult should arise, every time He
worked a miracle He bade the healed one conceal the fact in order that it
might be fulfilled, 'A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax
shall He not quench, till He sends forth judgment unto victory.' And here
let me ask, Do not the last words of this passage imply that the smoking
flax will be quenched and the bruised reeds will be broken when He shall
'send forth judgment unto victory'? Now is the season of His patience, but
a day of His wrath is on the way. He refrained from overthrowing His
antagonists in the days of His flesh, but in the time of His second coming
He will break His foes in pieces with a rod of iron! He will dash them in
pieces like pottersâ€™ vessels. THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH IT MUST NOT ONLY
BE ADMITTED, BUT GLORIED IN, THAT OUR LORD DID BOTH STRIVE AND CRY, for
spiritually He fought against sin even unto agony and blood. And with
thrilling eloquence and plenteous tears He did cry out against evil and
warn men to escape. HE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE LIKE A TRUMPET AN CRIED AND
SPARED NOT so that His persuasive voice was heard in the streets and
throughout all the land His Gospel was made known. But the passage teaches
us that while others were contentious for power, or, clamorous for gain
and eager for notoriety, Jesus was not so. He raised no party, He fomented
no strife, He sought no honor, He courted no popularity. He left the arena
of this worldâ€™s contests to others - His was another field of
conflict....Never did our Lord bid His servants fight, for His kingdom was
of another order. When, for once in His life, He rode in state as a king
through the streets of Jerusalem, the shouting was only that of children
who said, 'Hosanna' in the temple, and of a willing, peaceful company of
disciples, whose only weapons were palm branches...." (C. H. Spurgeon)

The Holy Spirit of wisdom was in our Lord. And wisdom is a STREET
PREACHER, reproving the world of sin, righteousness and judgment:

Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom CRIETH without; she uttereth her voice IN THE
STREETS:
21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the
gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners
delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
23 TURN YOU AT MY REPROOF...

Where are the preachers filled with God's Holy Spirit of wisdom today?
Dear friends, we have listened to the "new preachers." We have tried their
"new ways." These ways build great castles; but inside there are dead
men's bones. It is time to get back to the public, open-air preaching that
blessed the Roman world, and blessed America! Will you continue to be
silent?

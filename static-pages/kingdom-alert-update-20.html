<strong>THE WORLD WILL NOT BE CONVERTED BEFORE CHRIST RETURNS</strong>Â 

Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.Â 

The above Scripture states that the Kingdom of God is not yet here. It also teaches that when it comes it is coming to EARTH. Unless one can prove that the disciples were on some other planet in the â€œheavens,â€ the words, â€œThy kingdom COME,â€ mean the Kingdom is COMING down here on earth. Notice the words of Peter Jurieu in 1687:Â 

"Why hath He commanded us to pray daily, Thy Kingdom come, since that Kingdom is already come? for by that kingdom cannot be understood the eternal kingdom of Paradise...They say, â€˜tis the kingdom of the Father we pray forâ€™, i.e. of the Heavenly Paradise, the Eternal Kingdom, But we need only read what follows in the Lordâ€™s prayer, to be assured that it must be understood of a kingdom upon earth...â€˜Thy will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven...Thy Kingdom come upon earth, as it is already come in Heaven. So great difficulty have these Gentlemen, the Antimillenaries, to conceive a Kingdom of God upon earth, as for my own part, I find as great a one, not to conceive it."
("The Accomplishment Of The Scripture Prophecies")Â 

Indeed, notice another Scripture:Â 

Hebrews 13:14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.Â 

Surely, then we have the wrong place? The "here" must be contrasted with "there"? Not so! It is contrasted with this present TIME and the ungodly rulers of this present age. The city we seek (equipped with mansions!) will COME down and rest on Mount Zion during the Millennium and also during final eternity. Therefore we are looking for a CAPITAL CITY to come down and rule a Kingdom on EARTH:Â 

Revelation 5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.Â 

â€œWe believe that the New Jerusalem that shall come down from God out of heaven, when the tabernacle of God shall be with them and He will dwell among them, will be the Metropolitan City of this Kingdom, and will be the glorious place and residence of both Christ and His saints forever, and will be so situated as that the Kingly palace will be on Mount Zion, the holy hill of David, where his throne was...â€
(Baptist Confession of Faith, 1660)Â 

The Capital City (i.e. New Jerusalem) is now in Heaven. It will come down with Christ at His Second Coming for the Millennial reign:Â 

Revelation 3:12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.Â 

The city comes down OUT OF HEAVEN just like Paul states in Hebrews 13. Jesus is addressing 1st century, New Testament churches in a late date, after the sign gifts have passed. The hope set before them is a reign in a Kingdom ruled by a city on EARTH!Â 

But here we have some more confusion. Has Christ promised this blessed time on earth while He is absent? Will this kingdom â€œcomeâ€ without its KING? This is what many are teaching. It is popular because it professes to give Scriptural authority to worldliness! If the Kingdom comes without the Second Coming of Christ, then it must come through politics, the arts, social programs, etc. Since this is all a big fantasy, a delusion, Christians will compromise their standards to make it happen. Truth will be diluted so as many denominations (and cults) as possible may be organized to "bring in the Kingdom." Whoever compromises the most will usually have the most money and resources. Therefore, it all becomes even more wicked. Catholicism, Mormonism and Liberals are found to be right up front, courted by the "Evangelical" Kingdom-builders.Â 

Thus, when Christians fail (refuse) to see the next age ushered in by the Second Coming of Christ as the Kingdom, they begin to live for this one. Evil only increases as the Christian "salt" loses its savor. How ironic! When Christians turn from the next age (and the Second Coming) and occupy themselves with this world (trying to bring in a Kingdom without Christ literally present), they end up doing the LEAST for this world! It was the PREMILLENNIAL hope (anchored in the love of Scripture) that so blessed early America (e.g. Baptists and early Puritans). As Christians, motivated by the hope of reigning with Christ in the next world when He comes, labored diligently to save souls by the pure Gospel, much blessing was brought to the world as a by-product. Satan by no means was "bound." Evil was still very much present. Nevertheless, Christians were getting more done when their eyes were not on making a bed to lie down upon in this age without Christ:Â 

"Let us guard against the idea that it is either possible or destined, that Christianity will Christianize, in a real spiritual sense, the world in this present age. The kingdoms of this world must first be destroyed. Then only is it possible that, rising in a new form, they will become the Kingdom of our Lord and His Christ. This view of the world, and of our times, is founded on the Word of God."
(Auberlen, "Daniel")Â 

"During the present dispensation, before the return of our Lord, Satan will not be bound; therefore sin and open wickedness will continue to the end of it, and instead of becoming better, things, according to Scripture, will become worse and worse...This, then, plainly shows the notion entertained by many godly, excellent persons, that the world will be converted during the present dispensation by the preaching of the Gospel, and that the millennium will thus finally be introduced, to be not according to the Holy Scriptures."
(George Muller, "The Second Coming Of Christ")Â 

"The Church is not to be caught with the devilâ€™s glib guile of evolution, nor the unbelieverâ€™s smart phrase about the uplift of humanity, and making herself the second rate adjunct of an unregenerate worldâ€™s civilization, cry â€˜peaceâ€™ when there is no peace. Nay! The Church is to go forth and preach Christ and Him crucified. The Church is to tell men that the sacrificial blood of Godâ€™s Son is the only ground of approach to a holy God; that He did rise from the dead in the body in which He died; that He does sit at the right hand of God an immortal Man clothed with the infinite glory He had before the world was...This is the ministry to which we are called, O preachers of Christ. Let us see to it that we are up and at it; for if the kingâ€™s business required haste, much more His who is our Master and Lord. There is no time to lose and we have no one to fear but God."
(I.M. Haldeman)Â 

"The fact is, that the vast company of those who are seeking, through the preaching of the gospel, to establish the 'coming civilization of brotherly love,' have no place for the Blessed Hope. They are antagonistic to it....Christâ€™s return and His reign are spiritualized or else altogether repudiated...Let those who are â€˜lovers of truth,â€™ let those who cling to the apostolic faith, beware of the KINGDOM IDEA [i.e. postmillennialism, dominion theology, reconstructionism, etc.] which for the past two hundred years (since Daniel Whitby) has been steadily gaining ground, until the ripening product of that departure has all but swept the Church from her true testimony...Professed believers and confessed unbelievers vie with each other at the card table, the dance, the theater, and the lodge hall with its pagan rites. The lust for gold, the love of fashion and the lure of pride seem to hold saint as well as sinner in subjection...All this the KINGDOM IDEA has accomplished...The KINGDOM IDEA, in calling upon the Church to enter the world, has, in fact, assisted the world to enter the Church."
(R.E. Nieghbour, "The Kingdom Idea")Â 

"...according to James 4;4 and other passages a State Church in this age must of necessity be a Harlot Church."
(S.S. Craig, "The Dualism Of Eternal Life")Â 

The goal then is to lay Gospel tracts on cars everywhere you go. Go door to door in the weekly, local church ministry. Start making disciples of those the Lord has brought before you. It is hoped that the following biography will help move you to do as much as you can to save individuals OUT of the world as you live for the world to come at the Second Coming of Christ.Â 

<strong>ANTHONY NORRIS GROVES (1795-1853)</strong>Â 

Are you feeling a bit of self-pity? Perhaps a little down? Need some motivation? There is nothing like a good Christian biography to â€œset you straightâ€! Anthony N. Groves was an early â€œKingdomâ€ believer who made many sacrifices in this world to gain the world to come. He had a profound influence on the life of George Muller. The following is an extract from the â€œMemoir Of Anthony Norris Grovesâ€ (1869):Â 

â€œAnthony Norris Groves was born at Newton, In Hants, 1795. He was one of six children...His father spared no expense in his education...On leaving Fulham, he studied chemistry in London...He then availed himself of the offer of Mr. Thompson, his uncle, an eminent dentist...to learn that profession....and at the same time, walked the hospitals with a son of Thompson, and acquired considerable surgical skill...He was so skillful as a dentist, that at the age of nineteen, he was able to support himself....Plymouth was the place he first fixed on for practice...he was able to devote himself to many scientific objects...Soon after his marriage he removed from Plymouth to Exeter...It pleased the Lord greatly to bless and prosper him there, in every way. He grew rapidly in the knowledge of God, having, as his own narrative will show, a desire to fulfill all the will of God as soon as it was revealed to him...It will be interesting now to re-trace those steps by which Mr. Groves was led to spend his energies and means for the good of others, and the promotion of Christâ€™s Gospel. We have, happily, in his own words, the history of his early life:Â 

â€˜...I left London, towards the conclusion of my nineteenth year, and commenced my professional career at Plymouth, the 1st February, my nineteenth birthday. My success soon surpassed my hopes...my dearest Mary had been nursing a sick sister, very dear to us both; when she died, Maryâ€™s health had become so alarmingly undermined, that her dear father, who loved her much, having lost one daughter, felt unable longer to refuse his consent, and became as willing that we should be married, as he had before been anxious that we should not...We soon were married before I was twenty-two; and in the joy of possessing one who had so truly loved me, and after five years of trial, I for a moment quite forgot all my promises to the Lord and His work abroad; but this could not last long. I do not think I was wrong in marrying my dearest Mary...but I did a right thing in the wrong spirit. I ought to have asked Him, (my Lord,) and told him my difficulties, and He would, I know, have eased my way, and still have let me had all I sought. After we were married, and the first joy of surmounted difficulties passed away, our religious judgments could not long remain uncontrasted, and I soon powerfully felt they were awfully different...it now became the settled bent of her life, to root out my desire to go out as a missionary, and to reduce me to the same state of religious feelings as herself. She found those whom she loved not agreeable to me, and I did not wish to press on her those whom she did not love, so we lived almost alone after we arrived at Exeter; sometimes for a month, we did not go outside our garden gates...having me and the little children, with the cultivation of a few flowers and painting from nature, of which she was very fond, she was happy. We were greatly prospering in the world, her family were delighted and happy, and these things embraced all she ever knew or thought of happiness; but it was not so with me; I had given myself to the Lord, and to a work that I had not fulfilled...We were prospering more and more, so that renunciation became doubly difficult...Often did I, with every earthly thing that a man could desire, feel most miserable. I had a wife who loved me, dear little children, and a most lucrative profession, yet I had not the Lordâ€™s presence as in days past, and therefore I was miserable. About this time I was led to see that the plan I had been pursuing of making myself acquainted with general literature, in order to gain influence over those I came in contact with, was founded in error, and I was led to believe, that if I laid aside these false grounds of Christian influence, and gave myself up to study His holy word, the Lord would lead me to learn such principles from it, that I should see its sufficiency. From this moment, the Lord began to bless me, and was about to commence that great work of stripping off from our united hearts the thick clog with which we had been cumbering ourselves so many years, and to show us that nothing is too hard for Him. Soon after this, my mind became exercised about the right use of property, from the study of Godâ€™s word, and I soon saw that we had been greatly to blame, and as I was walking round the garden...I said to Mary, â€˜My love, I think we ought to lay by something regularly for the Lord, for you recollect when we commenced our career we often said, if we ever possessed a thousand a year, it would be the height of our wishes; now we have much more than this, therefore, let us begin to give some.â€™ She replied, â€˜Well, my dear, do as you like,â€™ and I fixed that it should be a tenth...I did not yet feel able to touch the subject of missions, but I said to her, â€˜Dearest M., since the Lord has so graciously received our little dedication of a tenth, and made it the means of blessing us, perhaps He would graciously receive more at our hands.â€™ â€˜Well,â€™ she said, â€˜it shall be so; we have now three little children, let it stand as one, and be a fourth:â€™ the more we gave the more we were blessed. My dearest M. threw aside all superfluous articles of dress, and put by all the things we had in our, or rather her, worldly days. In visiting the poor, no weather hindered her...With respect to property we had only yet gone a certain way; some may think it far enough, others too far; but my heart, which had been so blessed that it could not contain its blessing, felt that so long as anything was kept back from so gracious a Lord who had dealt so bountifully by us, it was as though nothing were given; and this led me to propose one day to my dearest M., that as the Lord had blessed us more and more, in all that we had given up for Him, perhaps He would accept all from our loving grateful hearts...but I recollect the tear coming into her eye, when she said, â€˜My dear, I think it would be most wicked; consider the dear little children.â€™ I saw the time was not come...After the deepest thought and the most earnest prayer, M., without reserve, gave it all up; and till the day of her death, only rejoiced in it more and more. When this great burden was once got rid of, we began to feel other than before; we had no object now in life, but living to the Lord...and in thus doing we were really living for our dear little ones ten times more effectually than in laying up poisonous heaps of gold. I had never yet spoken to M. about missions, yet, seeing the Lord had done so much, I saw no reason to doubt he could do all that remained...Mr. Bickersteth came down, and, in our dining parlour at E., I related to him my circumstances. I told him, I had offered myself...and that my whole desire was to do the Lordâ€™s will, and the greatest good to the Church at large, but especially to that object to whose interest I had pledged myself - the cause of missions. â€˜But this,â€™ I said, â€˜may be done in two ways, first, by giving oneâ€™s means, secondly, by personal exertions. In the first point of view, I have an increasing professional income, and have this year received nearly 1,500 [pounds], and dear Mrs. G., on the death of her father, will most probably have 10,000 or 12,000 more, the whole of which, with my present income, will of course, vanish, the moment we take the contemplated step.â€™ Mr. Bickerstethâ€™s answer was, â€˜If you are called of the Lord to the work, money cannot be set against it; it is men whom the Lord sends, and He stands in need of men more than money.â€™ I thought his judgment a wise and holy one, and I do to this day. He added, â€˜if you could give to the work as many thousands as you could hundreds, still, I would say, Go:â€™ - for we had told him, if we remained, we intended simply living on a minimum, and devoting all besides to God...we had a little circle of natural blessings seldom equaled, and rarely surpassed, and we knew them, and we were peculiarly capable of enjoying them; but we had found something better - to suffer with Christ. We had come to the point when it became necessary to communicate this strange, this heart-rending choice, to those we loved, especially to dear M.â€™s family, whose wounded affections and disappointed hopes, after all their love and kindness, were naturally shown to us. My heart bleeds, even to this day, while I am writing, to think of what I know her dear father suffered. At first everything that kindness and love could do to induce us to stop, was done; when this failed, less kind, but equally well-intentioned efforts, were made to deter us; besides our being cut off` from the sweets of family intercourse, dear M.â€™s father alluded to a mortgage of 1,000 he had lent, out of kindness, to my father. I was deeply wounded by the way he alluded to it, for I had never asked it of him, and I wrote back to say, I would never leave England till I paid it...This, and many arrangements I had to make for others before I left, set me almost as far as ever from the hope of leaving, except that dear M. was on my side; and by so much as she had hindered me in the first years of our marriage, by so much the more did she now encourage me, and kept up my heart, which was almost bowed down.â€Â

<strong>PHILIPINNE AND MEXICO MISSIONS</strong>Â 

There are many holy Christians in the Philippines serving God and building churches. Some brethren from our church have visited there not long ago to preach, deliver Bibles, tracts and funds, and encourage the saints. They have made many contacts. Some of these churches have dirt floors, etc. and the members do not have personal Bibles.Â 

Lacy Evans, a leader and Sunday School teacher at our church has some free time this summer to travel with Brother Mike Rupp to the Philippines. We are trying to raise the support from our church, and see if it is the Lordâ€™s will to send out this particular mission.Â 

We also have an up-coming Mexico mission in July (a brother and his wife are down there now getting it organized).Â 

If you would like to help donate some funds for Bibles, etc. for these churches in the PHILIPINNES (or contribute toward the plane ticket), please send a reply back to this KA Update. You will be given a detailed financial report of where the money was used and we plan to post pictures and letters on a web site. Please do not send any donations for the Philippine mission yet. For now we would simply like to know if you are interested in helping. This will help us to know what we are able to do. Here is a letter that arrived today:Â 

Dear Pastor Joey D. Faust,Â 

Greetings in the name of our Great Savior and coming King - Jesus Christ! Weâ€™re blessed by the ministry you have sent here in the Philippines. Brother Michael Rupp ministered to us here in Barangay Tortosa. He gave out King James Bible is Llonggo Version. Weâ€™re glad that God brought Bro. Mike to our place. Weâ€™re blessed by your ministry. Each member were privileged to have one copy...February, 1999 we celebrated our first anniversary and brother Michael Rupp was one of our speakers...God used His very own people to make His church building stand...but it is not yet totally finished... May, 1, 1999, four were added to the church, four were baptized..."
(Pastor Lanuza)Â

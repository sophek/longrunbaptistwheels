        <h1>THE 1948 RESTORATION OF ISRAEL IN UNBELIEF: PROPHETIC, BUT NOT THE FINAL FULFILLMENT</h1>
        <div id="content">
            I find it hard to tolerate scoffing, even when it is disguised as "a sane approach to the prophecies." I am not impressed by those Christians who bring out their earthquake charts and try to say that there is nothing significant occurring in regard to earthquakes in these modern times. No! And I am not moved by amillennial, postmillennial or non-Christian "conservatives" who decry the incredible weather changes and act as if the soon coming of Christ would interfere with their political plans. No! I believe the various earthquakes, droughts, weather changes, increases in violence, carnality of the churches, globalism, the revivals of Romanism, pantheism, and literal Babylon are all stage-setting signs for the coming Tribulation. This means the pre-trib rapture must be very near! This is no time for scoffing.

But I do think we must distinguish between a direct fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and an indirect fulfillment that sets the stage for a future, direct fulfillment. Most significant events prior to the pre-trib rapture (pictured by the 4 Beasts and 24 Elders in Revelation 4 and 5) must be seen as "footsteps." They are "pre-tribulational signs" that the "tribulational signs" are soon to begin. The tribulational signs point to the nearness of the end of the world and the return of Jesus Christ. However, the pre-tribulational signs only point to the nearness of the Tribulation period itself. We must resist the temptation to read the prophecies of Mt.24, Mark 13, Luke 21 and Revelation 6-20 (as well as the numerous OT prophecies) into this present age. This does not mean that God cannot bring to pass secondary fulfillments as examples of the future (e.g. Israel's destruction by Rome in A.D. 70). Certainly, the persecution of Christians by the Roman Catholic Church throughout history provides a dreadful example of what the Tribulation holds in the future (Rev.17:6). But secondary applications are not direct fulfillments. It is true that there are prophecies in the NT Epistles concerning the end of this present age in general (2Tim.3, etc.). But all other prophecies concern the Tribulation period or the Millennium. All significant events occurring before the rapture that are related to Bible prophecy must be seen as "stage-setting."

I do not mean to imply that we should simply brush off such things as weather changes, the increasing power of Iraq, the technology to bring to pass the Mark of the Beast, etc., as only interesting things worthy of our speculation. No, these things are so significant that every Christian should be filled with zeal to watch, pray and get ready for the rapture (Lk.21:36)! The tendency in saints will be to sleep or scoff and become entangled by the cares of this life (2Tim.2:4, Luke 8:14, 21:34), and therefore ignore the stage-setting signs. Can we be wrong about a certain stage-setting sign? Sure. But when there are multitudes of signs occurring, all at the same time, we should use them to stimulate us to become even more alert and ready for the rapture. G.H. Pember writes:

"Certainly, then, our duty is to take heed that we be not carried away by such vain excitements...but we must be still more careful to avoid the opposite extreme. It is better to be troubled by many false alarms than to be once taken by surprise..." ("The Great Prophecies," Vol.I, p.26)

This brings us to the subject of Israel. Israel was reborn as a nation in 1948. But is this event in 1948 a direct fulfillment of prophecy? The Bible certainly says that Israel will be persecuted and scattered in the Tribulation age (Luke 21:24, Dan.8:11-13, etc.). The Bible certainly says that the Antichrist will rebelliously sit in the temple in Jerusalem (2Thess.2:4). For years, Christian teachers have predicted that Israel must be revived so that these prophecies could be fulfilled. Therefore, if we see Israel restored as a nation at THE SAME TIME as we see so many other signs, we must reasonably conclude that God is providentially setting the stage for the Tribulation prophecies to be fulfilled. In this sense, the restoration of Israel is certainly prophetic!

However, this is quite different than teaching that the restoration of Israel in 1948 was a DIRECT fulfillment of certain Old Testament Scriptures. Dispensationalists that teach in such a manner are adding confusion to the doctrine of the mystery of this present age (Col.1:26, Eph.3:5,6). God often keeps time in two different ways (as we can see by comparing 1Kings 6:1 and Acts 13). Therefore, in regard to DIRECT fulfillment of prophecy, this current age is a mystery to the OT prophets. It is a parenthetical age. When the New Testament cites a NT event as a fulfillment of OT prophecy (after the Resurrection), it is referring to only a "secondary" fulfillment. Jesus taught the distinction between secondary (often figurative and near) and primary (literal and future) fulfillments of prophecy. He taught that John the Baptist was "spiritually" the Elijah prophesied by Malachi (Mt.11:14, Mal.4:5, Luke 1:17); yet He also taught that the Malachi prophecy would still be fulfilled literally in the future (Mt.17:11). We have therefore found the answer to all NT "fulfillments" of OT prophecy after Christ's Resurrection. They are only secondary fulfillments and do not replace the future, literal, primary fulfillments.

Therefore, there is no Biblical justification for interpreting any event in this present age (after the Resurrection and before the pre-trib translation) as a direct fulfillment of OT prophecy. Those Dispensationalists that teach that the 70 weeks of Daniel 9 are not consecutive weeks, and that there is a "gap of mystery" inserted between them, are INCONSISTENT if they then interpret the restoration of Israel in 1948 as a direct fulfillment of some OT prophecy. In a previous article, we have already noted this same inconsistency of some Dispensationalists in regard to Ezekiel 38 and 39 (Gog and Magog). According to the context, this attack must occur after the 3.5 year reign of the Beast, but before Armageddon. There are no OT, Jewish prophecies currently fulfilled in this age before the rapture:

"This is the present age...during which all Jewish prophecies are suspended...a parenthesis...on account of the perversity of the Jews; an inserted period, unknown to Old Testament prophecy..." (G.H. Pember, "The Great Prophecies," Vol. I, pp.43, 289)

But some argue that there will be TWO re-gatherings of Israel: one in unbelief in preparation for judgment, and one in faith, in preparation for Millennial blessing. This is certainly taught in the OT. However, it must be understood that the first restoration in unbelief in preparation for judgment occurs IN THE MIDST of the Tribulation period, not before it. The fact that the Jews have been re-gathered today in unbelief is only SETTING THE STAGE for a future destruction and captivity at the start of the Tribulation period from which the Jews will need a further restoration in unbelief. Therefore, the present restoration of 1948 is not a direct fulfillment of OT prophecy, but only a preparation for future fulfillment. The Jews will be attacked and scattered after the rapture. But they will be re-gathered in unbelief BEFORE the persecution of Antichrist. They will then be re-gathered again in preparation for the Millennium. There are therefore TWO major re-gatherings of Israel in the Tribulation period.

What is the reason that many Dispensationalists have inconsistently poked some holes in the present "age of mystery" in order to make room for the restoration of Israel in 1948? Aside from the shock value of reading current events directly into OT Jewish prophets, I believe it is because most modern Dispensationalists (unlike the majority in earlier days) are working with only a 7 year Tribulation age; and more than one re-gathering of Israel in so short a period appears improbable. But in understanding that the age is longer than 7 years (or as Clarence Larkin states in "Dispensational Truth," "Probably MUCH longer," p.14) the age of mystery is preserved and there is room to place the direct fulfillments of the OT prophecies in this longer, Tribulation age. But, whatever the reason, the modern tendency to begin opening up the present age of mystery (perhaps beginning with Hal Lindsey's interpretation of 1948 as referring to the Tribulational "Fig Tree" parable in Mt.24) is inconsistent and it leads to a blurring of the pretribulational rapture position.

Here is my loose outline of end times:

1. Israel is reborn in 1948 in unbelief, setting the stage for the direct fulfillment of the prophecies in the future Tribulation period.

2. The pre-trib translation of watching Christians occurs. (All events from this point on are direct fulfillments of Bible prophecy.)

3. In the confusion caused by the rapture, Iraq arises and attacks Israel.

4. Iraq is destroyed by Iran (Persians/Medes).

5. Israel is re-gathered in unbelief, to be later attacked by the Syrian Antichrist (Dan.8).

6. Israel is attacked and scattered by the Roman Antichrist for 3.5 years (Dan.7).

7. Israel is re-gathered.

8. Gog is destroyed, the "sign" of Christ's coming appears to all the world, and Israel is spiritually prepared for the final manifestation of the Messiah.

9. Jesus defeats the Beast at the battle of Armageddon.

Although many significant details have been omitted in the above outline (to avoid confusion), it nevertheless reveals that there is no reason to interpret the present restoration of Israel as anything other than significant stage-setting. The re-gatherings in unbelief mentioned in the OT refer to events that will take place IN the future Tribulation period, not before it. Although it is unlikely (based on all the current stage-setting signs), it is possible under this understanding for Jerusalem to again pass under Gentile control, only to be regained again in this age, or at the start of the Tribulation period.

Let us take a look at a few of these OT prophecies which some wrongly interpret as applying directly to 1948:

Zephaniah 2:1 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;
2 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you.
3 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.

There is nothing in the prophecy above that cannot refer to a re-gathering of Israel in the Tribulation period, yet before the Beast reigns.

Isaiah 11:10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.
11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the SECOND TIME to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
12 And he shall set up an ENSIGN for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

The restoration above is obviously not before the Tribulation period. It is near the end of that age AFTER the Beast has persecuted the Jews. It answers to Mt.24:30,31. The "second" time is relative to the Tribulation period, not the entire history of Israel. Israel will be scattered by literal Babylon at the start of the Trib. The nation will be then re-gathered in unbelief before the "Beast from Rome" reigns. Yet, the above Scriptures refer to a re-gathering in faith after (or as) the "root of Jesse" is revealed. It certainly cannot refer to the rebirth of Israel in 1948.

Ezekiel 20:33 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
34 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you FACE TO FACE.
36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.
37 And I will cause you to pass UNDER THE ROD, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:

Here is a re-gathering of Israel before they pass under the rod. However, again, it refers to a re-gathering of Israel in the Tribulation period, probably before the Beast comes to power. It is not a re-gathering BEFORE the Tribulation period. The above Scriptures can only be fulfilled literally in the Tribulation age. God is not pleading with Israel "face to face" in this age before the Tribulation. Nor can it be said that God is "ruling over" Israel today, before the rapture (Ezek.20:33). These Scriptures speak of events that will occur in the midst of the Tribulation age.

All other OT prophecies concerning Israel refer to a Millennial restoration or a re-gathering in the midst of the Tribulation period.

How then do we use the rebirth of Israel in 1948 to witness to unbelievers? We simply show that the Bible predicts certain events in the Tribulation period that can only occur with the Jews in their land. We then show how people, years ago, have mocked these prophecies by referring to the fact that Israel was not presently (in their day) in their land. We then show how many Christians have argued throughout history that Israel must soon be restored as a nation. We then point out that the fact that Israel has been restored in 1948 (mixed with other signs) reveals that God, in His providence, is obviously setting the stage for the fulfillment of end-time Bible prophecy. The fact that the rebirth of Israel in 1948 is only an "indirect" fulfillment of Bible prophecy, in no way diminishes the fact that it is a significant, incredible, amazing event of God's providence, preparing the world for the coming Tribulation period! Look up and win souls!

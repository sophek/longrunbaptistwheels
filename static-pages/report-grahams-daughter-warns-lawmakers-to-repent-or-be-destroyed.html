            GRAHAM'S DAUGHTER WARNS LAWMAKERS TO REPENT OR BE DESTROYED "The North Carolina Senate honored the Rev. Billy Graham as a 'favorite son of North Carolina' this week while his daughter, Anne Graham Lotz, exhorted lawmakers to repent before God, whose judgment, she said, is imminent. Lotz, who lives here, represented her 82-year-old father...'We are living in a wicked world,' she said, citing abortion, euthanasia, pornography, unscrupulous politicians and the glorification of violence as proof. 'The lesson of Noah is that there's a limit to God's patience,' Lotz said. 'At some point he draws the line...We're drawing close to that line. God is warning us. Repent. Judgment is coming.'"

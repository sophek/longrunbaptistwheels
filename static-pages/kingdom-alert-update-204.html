WHO WAS ISAAC MASSEY HALDEMAN?

Isaac Massey Haldeman (1845-1933) was a Baptist pastor who took a strong
stand against modernism and worldliness at the beginning of the 20th
century. He more than made up for his lack of formal, theological
education by his life of intense study, reading, and writing. He never
shied away from controversy where the Lord's truth was concerned. Notice
some testimonies concerning his life and ministry:

"I. M. Haldeman (1845-1933): 'He who denies the virgin birth denies Bible
Christianity, smites the mother of our Lord with shame, snatches the crown
of Deity from His head, strips Him of His sinless humanity, and makes His
cross a blood-stained failure.' Dr. Haldeman was the longtime pastor of
First Baptist Church, New York City, and one of the foremost of Bible
expositors. His best-known work was 'The Tabernacle Priesthood and
Offerings.' With great wealth of detail, he shows how the framework, the
coverings, the curtains, the hangings, the priesthood, the robes and the
offerings of the Tabernacle in the wilderness prefigured the Person, the
work and the glory of Christ. Another well-known volume was 'How to Study
the Bible.' Dr. Haldeman believed that the New Testament is a fulfillment
of the Old, that each book of the entire Bible finds place and value by
the law of growth-and by a moral and spiritual logic....Other books by
this great Bible scholar include: 'The Coming of Christ'; 'Ten Sermons on
the Second Coming'; 'Christ, Christianity and the Bible'; 'Can the Dead
Communicate With the Living?'"(SwordoftheLord.com)

"Baptist pastor. Born in Concordville, Pennsylvania....Was ordained to the
Baptist ministry in 1870. After serving Northern Baptist churches in
Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania (1871-1875), and Wilmington, Delaware
(1875-1884), he was called to the First Baptist Church of New York City,
where he remained until his death nearly fifty years later. Because
Haldeman was an outstanding pulpit orator, his parishioners often found
standing room only at the rear of the church. Haldeman was deeply
committed to the fundamentalist crusade against 'worldliness' in any of
its forms but especially the theater. As a dispensationalist he had
radical views of cultural pessimism. In 'The Signs of the Times' (1910),
he provided a popular reading of prophecy and current events, indicating
that the end of history was near....Haldeman was also active in the
fundamentalist-modernist controversy, contending with fellow Baptists
Cornelius Woelfkin, Harry Emerson Fosdick, and Walter Rauschenbusch...In
1909 William Jewel College conferred on him an honorary degree of
D.D."("Dictionary of Christianity in America," 1990)

"The venerable I. M. Haldeman began his Sunday morning sermon in his
typical staccato, machine-gun style of speaking. he had no sooner gotten
into his message when the congregation noticed him hesitate as though
groping for words. Finally, there was a long pause. Then, in a subdued
voice he said, Dear friends, for the first time in sixty years I have
forgotten everything I was going to say.' A few minutes later he
pronounced the benediction....That evening he made his confession in deep
humility. he had of late been guilty, he said, of the sin of
pride....Those who heard him preach that night said he spoke for one and a
half hours, and that he rose to planes of greatness never reached
before....I. M. Haldeman, long after he might have laid down his sword and
trowel, continued to wield them with the zest of an adolescent..." (David
Otis Fuller, "Valiant For the Truth")

"So far as my knowedge extends, Dr. Haldeman is the greatest prophet of
the Lord now standing in any pulpit in this country." (James M. Gray)

"Dr. Haldeman was probably the most influential preacher of prophetic
themes in his generation in this country." (Wilbur Smith, 'A Preliminary
Bibliography...,' 1952)

A few of the more popular books and pamphlets authored by Haldeman are as
follows:

-"Millennial Dawnism: The Blasphemous Religion which teaches the
Annihilation of Jesus Christ"

-"The History of the Doctrine of the Lord's Return"

-"The Scarlet Woman, or the Revival of Romanism"

-"How to Study the Bible" (1904)

-"The Coming of Christ: Both Premillennial and Imminent" (1906)

-"Baptism - A Prequisite to the Lord's Supper"

-"Jericho Theology: The Modern Theological College, a Menace and a Peril
to the Church" (1909)

-"Christ, Christianity and the Bible: A Restatement of the Fundamentals of
the Faith" (1912)

-"The Signs of the Times" (1913)

-"Bible Expositions" (1916)

-"Ten Sermons On the Second Coming" (1917)

-"The Kingdom of God: An Answer To Philip Mauro; Introduction by A. C.
Gaebelein"

-"A King's Penknife, Or, Why I Am Opposed To Modernism" (1929)

In future Kingdom Alerts, I plan to offer some excerpts from articles by
Haldeman on the rise of the Roman Catholic Church, as well as literal
Babylon, in Bible prophecy.

I.M. HALDEMAN ON THE SALVATION GOSPEL

"So strong was his emphasis on salvation by faith that the citizens of
Wilmington came to refer to him as 'Only Believe' Haldeman." (David Otis
Fuller, "Valiant For the Truth")

"Because that Cross is the demonstration of the unimpeachable
righteousness of God, it has enabled Him to bring the world upon mercy
ground where he can deal with it in grace, justify the ungodly and still
be just....The moment any sinner, be he ever so stained, so sunken and
hopeless in sin, offer up Christ on the Cross by faith as his sacrifice
for sin and claims Him as his personal substitute, as having taken his
place and suffered for Him, that moment the Father accepts the death of
the Cross for the believing sinner, counts him to have died in the Person
of His Son, counts the wrath which fell upon the Son as having fallen on
the believer....He is eternally saved....So complete, so ample and so
immediately available is this provided salvation that tonight, at this
present moment, any individual sinner here....if he will in child-like
simplicity take God at His Word, claim the crucified Christ as his
sacrificial substitute....You shall be saved now and safe forever
more....We are to speak the simple word and tell them to touch Him with
the touch of faith, to believe and 'only believe' and they shall be
saved."
("The Judgment Seat of Christ"; from "Ten Sermons on the Second Coming,"
1917)

I. M. HALDEMAN ON MODERNISM, TOLERATION, AND THE RISE OF SATANIC "LOVE"
AND "LIBERTY"

"The only thing recognized in matters of morals, the only standard for the
definition and measure of God and things divine will be personal
experience. Those who attempt to bind the conscience, direct the soul, and
set before it a definite concept of God and a fixed line of conduct in
respect to Him and to one another will be looked upon, not only as narrow
bigots, but as intolerable tyrants, as criminal hinderers to all true
knowledge....The new generation is intoxicated with the rallying cry of
'self-expression.' The new generation is letting itself go. If it has any
standard, it is the standard of exalted personalism and self-pleasing at
any cost to old law and old custom or old manners....With the weakening
down of law and self-restraint, there is the over-leaping race for
material pleasures. This is the inspiration of the 'get-rich-quick
movement'; get money that may be spent on pleasure and more pleasure....No
one has time; all are pressed, life is too short to stop and think ....'On
with the song' and 'on with the dance,' these are the cries, and the music
goes faster and more furious, the very sounds of the music are barbaric,
appealing to the animal, to the brute sense within, stirring the blood,
adding fuel to the fire till passion is at white heat....'The life that
now is' forms the horizon of the vast army of young men and women coming
out of school and college. All their instruction, all their equipment is
for this world....Let modernism continue its work of near pantheism, its
agnostic attitude concerning the soul and the other side of death, and in
a few hurrying years the moral and spiritual ruin of the coming generation
cannot be imagined....To talk against Modernism and then hob-knob and
picnic with Modernists, is not merely individually contemptible, but
actual betrayal of the truth....There ought to be neither fellowship nor
friendship with Modernists....How can you be the friend of a man who
denies that the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, will come again to this
world, and that He will come visibly...? How can you be a friend of the
man who cuts your Bible to pieces...? If you would be loyal to Him and
steadfast for the faith committed to you, you can have no toleration for
those who under the title of modernist and the disguise of progressive and
liberal Christianity betray the Son of God in the house of His
friends...'For he that biddeth him God speed is a partaker of his evil
deeds.' (2 John 10, 11). Such an attitude will raise the cry of 'bigotry'
and 'bigot.' The crowd takes that word out to the stone pile and would
stone it to death and endless silence. But that same word 'bigot' is a
very good word....This is the meaning of it: 'By God.'....The men who have
achieved most for God, the men whose work has abided, have been men who
have been the men who said, 'by God,' and knew no other standard....'By
God' is only another way of saying, 'Thus saith the Lord.' Another word
flung cheaply at those who stand for the integrity of the Bible, not only
as a rule of faith, but practice, is the easy epithet: 'Narrow.' There are
Christians, even in the pulpit, good enough and wanting to be faithful to
their calling, who shiver whenever the word is uttered in their
neighborhood....But as I recall the preaching of the Son of God, I find it
was along the line of a NARROW positivism: It was he who said: 'Narrow is
the way that leadeth unto life.'....To raise a hue and cry against this as
'divisive;' to appeal to compromise for the sake of 'brotherhood' and
'Christian charity' and to talk about LOVE BEING MORE IMPORTANT IN THE
CHURCH THAN CORRECTNESS OF DOCTRINE, is emotional weakness and fallacious
folly....The word 'toleration' must be cut out of the church vocabulary.
You cannot find it in the Bible. It is not a nice word. It is not to be
found in good company. It is a word much used by middle-of-the-road men.
It has in it, no matter how much dissimulated, the crawling, creeping
movement of surrender....Why should the Church tolerate men who no longer
tolerate the Bible as God gave it to us...?"
("A King's Penknife, Or, Why I Am Opposed To Modernism," 1929; emphasis in
the original)

I. M. HALDEMAN ON POST-MILLENNIALISM

"8 P.M. 'Are Pre-Millennialists Pessimists? Does their doctrine of the
imminent coming of Christ cut the nerve of missionary effort, discourage
Christian activity and stop progress in the church; or is it the
Postmillennialist who practically denies an inspired Bible, teaches
ethical culture instead of Blood redemption and deceives the world with
false hopes of peace? Dr. Haldeman will bring post-millennialism to the
bar of Holy Scripture and demonstrate that it is the dry-rot of the Church
today." (Church Ad in NY newspaper; 1906?)

I. M. HALDEMAN ON FEMINISM

"A child was to be born to the nation of Israel; but birth of a child in
that nation where motherhood was considered as a seal of the favor of God,
and where woman with her insane cry of 'equal rights' had not as yet
repudiated her sex, nor sought to violate its organic and Divine
limitations by claiming the place and function of a man, was not a
phenomenon...." ("This Hour Not the Hour of the Prince of Peace," a sermon
preached before the New York State Convention, October 27, 1915)

"'Worse than infidelity, plainly visible in the church today, is the wave
of feminism that is invading the pulpit,' the Rev. Dr. I. M. Haldeman told
his congregation yesterday in the Sunday morning services at the First
Baptist Church, Broadway and Seventy-ninth Street. (New York City). Dr
Haldeman preached his first sermon yesterday after an illness of five
weeks. 'Today teachings of infidelity are plainly evident in the church,'
Dr. Haldeman said. 'But a thing to be feared even more than these
teachings is the invasion of the pulpit by feminism that is now taking
place. Feminism is that widespread disease that is putting women out of
their place...It is not a question of brain, but a question of following
the teachings of Christ. To bring a woman into the pulpit is to sin
against the most holy of Christian institutions - the Holy Ghost...."
("New York Times," March 21, 1927)

I. M. HALDEMAN  ON THE WORLDLY THEATER

"Side by side with this doctrinal down-grade, it was foretold that the
church, professed Christians, should be 'lovers of pleasures more than
lovers of God...'...The prophecy finds its realization in the fact that
places of public amusement obtain their support largely, if not mainly,
from professed Christians...("The Signs of the Times")

A notice printed in the "New York Times" read:

"A DENIAL: It having been reported in the newspapers that Pastor Haldeman,
of the First Baptist Church, Broadway and 79th St., recently attended a
theatre, he takes this occasion to deny it, as an invention of Satan, and
to say that he is against the Theatre as he is against all other like
agencies of the Devil. I. M. Haldeman, D.D."

I. M. HALDEMAN ON MODERN, REBELLIOUS "SCHOLARSHIP"

"The minister of the new religion will not be a man who shall stand up
like the Apostle Paul and preach Jesus and the resurrection. He will be
the graduate of a medical college...Its instrumentalities will be the
pharmacy of the druggist..." ("The New Religion")

"There is at present a widespread movement to exalt human wisdom in the
Christian pulpit. This wisdom calls itself by the high sounding title of
'scholarship.' It professes to be scientific, philosophical and
liberal...It places the Bible in a secondary plane and demands that it
shall be interpreted or modified according to the thought of the
hour....It is intolerant and almost contemptuous of that preaching which
bases itself alone upon a 'thus saith the Lord.' Its sacramental phrase is
'Scholarship is agreed.' From this self-elected tribunal it warns all who
do not agree with it that they are declassed and unworthy of an interested
hearing. It is full of boasting....[Paul] warns the Colossians against
those preachers who would seek to spoil them with philosophy and vain
deceit...and he exhorts Timothy not to be seduced by the 'oppositions of
science falsely so called.'..." ("Thinking Above What is Written")

I. M. HALDEMAN ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST

After the death of C. I. Scofield (1843-1921), Haldeman wrote a book in
his defense. In it, he stated:

"Among the many editions of Bible notes and commentaries in my library,
there has been for some years, a fine copy of the Scofield Bible (a gift
to me). In all these years I have opened that copy and read some of the
notes, probably, a half dozen times, not more.  Until recently, I could
not say I was fully acquainted with Dr. Scofield's notes."

The two most popular men who dared to publish Bibles with their own notes
in them were Scofield and Bullinger. While I am thankful for their defense
of premillennial truth, and many other true insights, one serious defect
in both men (and their "bibles") has been their particular degrees of
dispensationalism (and the conclusions they draw from them). Their systems
remove the modern Christian from scores of promises, warnings and
commands. These extra, false "conclusions" were not necessary to the main
truths of their premillennial systems. Instead, these conclusions are
actually destructive to morals and sound doctrine. Perhaps it was these
extremes which drove good men like Mauro and Pink to throw the baby out
with the bath-water and go off the deep end (leaving the premillennialism
they once contended for). The premillennial, dispensational schemes of
such men as Govett, Graves, Pember, Fry, George Peters, Neighbor, Nee,
Ironside, Rice, etc (and many others), while differing in some respects,
nevertheless hold fast the commands of the Lord Jesus. They do not
outright and openly remove the present believer from all accountability to
the Lord's words.

Due to the many sermons, over many years, that Haldeman preached and
wrote, he seems to go back and forth somewhat on his views of where to
limit the application of the Gospels. Although I. M. Haldeman taught some
of the weaker and dangerous aspects of what should be called "Scofieldism"
(at certain times misapplying the Sermon on the Mount to the Millennium),
he nevertheless, rightly applied many other Gospel warning passages to
true believers. Therefore, when Haldeman emphasized the Second Coming in
his preaching, he was able to WARN modern Christians (like Scripture
does), instead of ONLY preaching the unconditional promises.

Haldeman appeared to believe that all unwatchful, unfaithful Christians
will be "banished" for 1000 years, and will miss out on reigning with
Jesus on the Millennial Earth. While usually silent as to the place of
banishment, I have seen it written in one place that he held that
unfaithful believers stay in Heaven. The Scriptures he applies to
believers, however, plainly warn of something more grievous! Nevertheless,
I am thankful for Haldeman's application of many Gospel warning passages
to true believers. Here are some excerpts from his writings:

"The wicked servant [in Luke 19:22] belongs to the category of those who
will be ashamed before Him at His Coming; who shall not receive an
abundant entrance into the kingdom; who shall lose their crown and be shut
out from participation in 'the joy of the Lord,' even His rule and glory
on earth." ("The Coming of Christ: Premillennial and Imminent," 1906)

"The steward who has taught the household that the lord has delayed his
coming; who teaches that there is 'something' between the household and
the coming of the master will be 'cut off' when he comes....The lord will
come and cut off that steward in an hour when 'he looketh not for
him.'....The meaning has no lameness in its feet; it comes to us
quickly....The Teacher who teaches that the Lord' delays' His
coming...will be 'cut off,' excommunicated FROM THE KINGDOM, when the Lord
comes."
("The Coming of Christ: Premillennial and Imminent," 1906)

"There are many Christians who imagine if they just live what they call a
Christian life and never say a word about Christ, they are efficiently and
satisfactorily witnessing for Him. It is a great a grievous mistake....A
Christian who lives an inconsistent life, whose speech is full of
unbelief, of doubt or worldliness, carelessness and open sin; a Christian
who continually does things no Christian ought to do and who goes where a
faithful and devoted Christian ought never to go, becomes sooner or later,
in so far as the world outside goes, a worthless witness....We are to give
of our substance. Do you imagine that God prospers any of us in this world
that we may wholly spend our substance on ourselves?....The matter of
giving is at bottom a moral and spiritual test....We are here to mean
business for God, and we shall be examined at the Judgment Seat of Christ
for the way in which we have endeavored to fill our missions as
Christians....We will have to make our speech to Him....Everything will
come out in that all-searching light....At this Judgment Seat all things
will be adjusted by the Lord....If a Christian has wronged you in any
fashion....such a one will have to apologize to you before high heaven and
the assembled host....The Christian who at the Judgment Seat of Christ is
judged and determined as faithful will receive a reward. He will be
permitted to ENTER IN AND SHARE the joy of the Lord....One of the joys in
that joyful sharing of the joy of Christ will be the privilege, not only
of rulership, but sitting at the feet of the King Himself....The Christian
who shall not be found faithful will suffer loss. HE CANNOT ENTER INTO the
joy of the Lord....O what rubbish heaps some churches are! All sorts of
means used to draw the people, street cleaners with their band, baseball
experts to talk of the benefit of physical sobriety...lectures, moving
show pictures, ice cream suppers, dramatic entertainments, social
clubs...minstrel shows, burlesques and dancing....the bigger the bulk the
bigger the bonfire it will make....NONE OF THESE SHALL ENTER INTO AND
SHARE THE JOY OF THE LORD. THEY CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE KINGDOM ON
EARTH....Christians who live notoriously and inconsistent lives; who
openly dishonor the Name of Christ...who claim the assurance of salvation;
who no doubt really believe, but refuse to bring forth the things which
accompany salvation; these shall suffer loss....O what disaster, what
shame if for the sake of a dance, a game of cards, a glass of wine, a
night in the theater; what disaster if for the sake of
self-pleasure....what indescribable shame if we should find WE WERE SHUT
OUT from that golden hour, that splendid sweep of a thousand
heaven-illuminated years. It is time to awake...."
("The Judgment Seat of Christ"; from "Ten Sermons on the Second Coming,"
1917)

THOUSANDS OF CHRISTIAN WOMEN VIEW THE NAKED REAR-END OF A LOST, CATHOLIC
MOVIE STAR
************************************************************************

According to the New York Post's "Family Film Guide," Mel Gibson's "The
Passion of the Christ" CONTAINS NUDITY!:

"Sex/nudity: A glimpse of bare male buttocks."

According to viewers, this scene occurs when the "Hollywood Jesus" has
resurrected from the dead. Therefore, these Hollywood sinners were not
content to show their "movie star" simply in a loin cloth. They showed his
bare buttocks. One can only imagine the foul-mouthed cussing and mocking
laughter that must have taken place at the thought of flashing the bare
buttocks of James Caviezel, whom female movie critics call "dreamy,"
before the eyes of thousands of young Sunday school girls! These business
men obviously knew they could GET AWAY WITH IT; and that in itself is a
sad commentary on the state of Christian churches in America. Gibson knew
that thousands of Christians were already viewing nudity in their own
homes through cable or satellite television every week. GIBSON STRUCK GOLD
BY FEEDING THESE CHRISTIAN PERVERTS just the right amount of "flesh." If
he went wrong just a few feet in any direction, it could have spelt
disaster for his investment. If the movie did not have enough flesh to be
rated R, the carnal Christians would not rally behind it. But if it went
TOO FAR, the celebrity Christian leaders would not promote it. Is it not a
SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS that thousands of Christians and professing
Christians have viewed the naked rear-end of a long-haired, unsaved,
Hollywood star - many taking their entire YOUTH GROUPS to behold this
scene (with many even having CHURCH at the THEATER), and yet there has
been NOTHING BUT APPROVAL from these millions of Christians concerning
this movie!? We certainly must pray for repentance across our land. One
month, thousands of Christians are viewing nudity at the Super Bowl (many
on the big screen in their churches), and the very next month, wives,
mothers and daughters are looking at a Hollywood star show them his
rear-end!

Gibson gave the silly Christian women a "Hollywood star" in a loin cloth,
and then had him flash his naked rear-end as an ENCORE. They gave the
foolish Christian men some exciting, bloody violence. They certainly know
their business! They knew to give these Christians and professors JUST
ENOUGH flesh to have them flock to the movie and tell others about it;
yet, at the same time, they cloaked this flesh in the greatest of all
themes, thus providing the religious COVERING. The Devil's crowd is
laughing all the way to the bank!

How many FATHERS and HUSBANDS would allow a long-haired man to come into
their living rooms wearing a loin cloth, and then FLASH HIS NAKED BEHIND
to their daughters and wives? I hope that we have not fallen so far that
many Christian men would allow such a thing! But why then, have so many
thousands of Christian fathers and husbands actually PAID MONEY to show
their daughters and wives the NAKED BUTTOCKS of this unsaved, Hollywood
"star" on a GIANT SCREEN? They say that they did not know such a thing
would occur. But why didn't they love their families enough to read a
family-friendly review of the movie before exposing their families to the
movie? And why haven't these men who have publicly justified going to see
the movie, expressed a public repentance after seeing such scenes?

People think that some great thing is occurring and that this interest in
the death of Jesus is a sign of "holy revival." Instead, it is a sign of
the revival of the UNHOLY ROMAN EMPIRE (Papal Rome)! The Devil (who hates
Christians) is LAUGHING. He is laughing because he has caused thousands of
girls to be placed in the confused position of feeling LUST for a man
playing "JESUS." This is pure wickedness.

Shame on James Dobson, and every other undiscerning, Christian leader or
pastor who has filled the pockets of Mel Gibson at the expense of the
chastity and honor of Christian women. Shame on every Christian father and
husband who took his family to view this film. God has given YOU the
responsibility to RULE your home and LEAD it after godliness. Why did YOU
let your wife and daughters view the naked BUTTOCKS of an unsaved,
"dreamy" Hollywood star? If you cannot resist the Hollywood spirit of the
world when it begins to blow softly, how will you withstand what is
coming, as the spirit of Antichrist gains power before the rapture?:

Jeremiah 12:5 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied
thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of
peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in
the swelling of Jordan?
 
We need men who will be PILLARS, who will not be blown about by every wind
of COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING. All the Devil had to do was to raise up an ugly
enemy on one side, and then proclaim, "The religious movie is being
attacked by Atheists! Run Christians! Defend the Holy Land! Buy tickets to
Mel Gibson's movie! Go crusaders!", and he was sure of momentary success.
Brethren, repent, and take a stand today. Be silent no longer.

ONWARD CHRISTIAN MOVIE-GOERS! (news report)
***********************************************
"Onward Christian Movies - Between the art-house snobs and the mall-rat
teenyboppers, there's an emerging movie target audience: the religious
faithful. Matthew Crouch is primping for the cameras. It's a Thursday
evening in Orange County, California, and the Trinity Broadcast Network's
studio is filled. Offstage, Crouch watches as a power-dressed pastor pumps
up the audience. In the Christian film industry, apparently, it takes more
than faith to market a movie. Five years ago, Crouch, an independent
producer and the president of Gener8Xion Entertainment, shocked Hollywood
when his movie 'The Omega Code' cracked the top ten in its opening
weekend. Despite a slender promotional budget, the apocalyptic thriller
rooted in scripture went on to gross more than $12 million. To sell it,
Crouch relied heavily on the very same nationally syndicated TV show he is
cohosting tonight....Crouchâ€™s business fervor may be surprising to many
industry watchers, but he's far from alone. Today's biggest faith-based
producers talk about their bottom lines WITH THE SAME ARDOR ONCE RESERVED
FOR REVIVALS....it's the 'virgin market' of movie-going evangelicals some
80 million strong....Since 'Omega,' the RELIGIOUS DRIVE TOWARD HOLLYWOOD
HAS CONTINUED FULL-THROTTLE....Crouch is moving ahead with plans for a $35
million studio near Universal, and Lalonde says heâ€™s deep in negotiations
for Cloud Ten to become the first studio-backed Christian movie division.
At the same time, he's finalizing script details on a $60 million to $80
million sci-fi film....For now, marketers like Bock face a more
traditional challenge. They must convince Christians to plop down their
money for Hollywood's more conventional films -or at least not protest its
product....Bock believes inviting clergy to screenings raises at least
some expectation they'll pass recommendations along to parishioners. 'We
hope they'll see it as a film their congregations can embrace and enjoy.
That they'll share it with their congregations. Use it as a sermon
example.'...the studios, which, if Bock's list of credits is any
indication, are more interested in attracting Christians to family films
than producing Christian films for families...." (WND; www.premiere.com)

THE MENACE OF THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE,  BY A.W. TOZER (1897-1963)
*******************************************************************
[Ed. It appears that modern Christians may need to take another look at
this old article by Tozer! Some of it is very timely. After you read this
article, ask yourself what men like Tozer, if they were alive today, would
think of Gibson's gory, Catholic movie, with its bare buttocks, and
pornography stars! Two quotes from Tozer's article are very notable. Tozer
writes: "IT TAKES NO GREAT INSIGHT TO SEE THAT THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE MUST
BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE THRILLING AS THE TASTES OF THE SPECTATORS BECOME
MORE AND MORE STIMULATED." And again: "THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE IS AT PRESENT
UNDERGOING A PERIOD OF GESTATION AND SEEMS ABOUT TO SWARM OVER THE
CHURCHES LIKE A CLOUD OF LOCUSTS OUT OF THE EARTH." How true he was in
both quotes. Awaken children of God, and let us cleanse our hands!]

"When God gave to Moses the blueprint of the Tabernacle He was careful to
include every detail; then, lest Moses should get the notion that he could
improve on the original plan, God warned him solemnly, 'And look that thou
make them after their pattern, which was shown thee in the mount.' God,
not Moses, was the architect. To decide the plan was the prerogative of
the Deity. No one dare alter it so much as a hairbreadth. The New
Testament Church also is built after a pattern. Not the doctrines only but
the methods are divinely given. The doctrines are expressly stated in so
many words. Some of the methods followed by the early New Testament Church
had been given by direct command; others were used by God's specific
approval, having obviously been commanded the apostles by the Spirit. The
point is that when the New Testament canon was closed the blueprint for
the age was complete. God has added nothing since that time. From God's
revealed plan we depart at our peril. Every departure has two
consequences, the immediate and the remote. The immediate touches the
individual and those close to him; the remote extends into the future to
unknown times, and may expand so far as to influence for evil the whole
Church of God on earth.

The temptation to introduce 'new' things into the work of God has always
been too strong for some people to resist. The Church has suffered untold
injury at the hands of well intentioned but misguided persons who have
felt that they know more about running God's work than Christ and His
apostles did. A solid train of box cars would not suffice to haul away the
religious rubbish which has been brought into the service of the Church
with the hope of improving on the original pattern. These things have
been, one and all, positive hindrances to the progress of the Truth, and
have so altered the divinely-planned structure that the apostles, were
they to return to earth today, would scarcely recognize the misshapen
thing which has resulted.

Our Lord while on earth cleansed the Temple, and periodic cleansings have
been necessary in the Church of God throughout the centuries. Every
generation is sure to have its ambitious amateur to COME UP WITH SOME
SHINY GADGET which he proceeds to urge upon the priests before the altar.
That the Scriptures do not justify its existence does not seem to bother
him at all. It is brought in anyway and presented in the very name of
Orthodoxy. Soon it is identified in the minds of the Christian public with
all that is good and holy. Then, of course, to attack the gadget is to
attack the Truth itself. This is an old familiar technique so often and so
long practiced by the devotees of error that I marvel how the children of
God can be taken in by it.

We of the evangelical faith are in the rather awkward position of
criticizing Roman Catholicism for its weight of unscriptural impedimenta
and at the same time tolerating in our own churches a world of religious
fribble as bad as holy water or the elevated host. HERESY OF METHOD MAY BE
AS DEADLY AS HERESY OF MESSAGE.. Old-line Protestantism has long ago been
smothered to death by extra-scriptural rubbish. Unless we of the gospel
churches wake up soon we shall most surely die by the same means.

Within the last few years a new method has been invented for imparting
spiritual knowledge; or, to be more accurate, it is not new at all, but is
an adaptation of a gadget of some years standing, one which by its origin
and background belongs not to the Church but to the world. Some within the
fold of the Church have thrown their mantle over it, have 'blessed it with
a text' and are now trying to show that it is the very gift of God for our
day. But, however eloquent the sales talk, it is an unauthorized addition
nevertheless, and was never a part of the pattern shown us on the mount.

I REFER, OF COURSE, TO THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE. For the motion picture as such
I have no irrational allergy. It is a mechanical invention merely and is
in its essence amoral; that is, it is neither good nor bad, but neutral.
With any physical object or any creature lacking the power of choice it
could not be otherwise. Whether such an object is useful or harmful
depends altogether upon WHO USES IT and what he uses it for. No moral
quality attaches where there is no free choice. Sin and righteousness lie
in the will. The motion picture is in the same class as the automobile,
the typewriter, or the radio: a powerful instrument for good or evil,
depending upon how it is applied.

For teaching the facts of physical science the motion picture has been
useful. The public schools have used it successfully to teach health
habits to children. The army employed it to speed up instruction during
war. That it has been of real service within its limited field is freely
acknowledged here.

Over against this is the fact that the motion picture in evil hands has
been a source of moral corruption to millions. No one who values his
reputation as a responsible adult will deny that the sex movie and the
crime movie have done untold injury to the lives of countless young people
in our generation. The harm lies not in the instrument itself, but in the
evil will of those who use it for their own selfish ends.

These pictures are produced by ACTING a religious story before the camera.
Take for example the famous and beautiful story of the Prodigal Son. This
would be made into a movie by treating the narrative as a scenario. Stage
scenery would be set up, actors would take the roles of Father, Prodigal
Son, Elder Brother, etc. There would be plot, sequence and dramatic
denouement as in the ordinary tear jerker shown at the Bijou movie house
on Main Street in any one of a thousand American towns. The story would be
acted out, photographed, run onto reels and shipped around the country to
be shown for a few wherever desired.

The 'service' where such a movie would be shown might seem much like any
other service until time for the message from the Word of God. Then the
lights would be put out and the picture turned on. The 'message' would
consist of this movie. What followed the picture would, of course, vary
with the circumstances, but often an invitation song is sung and a tender
appeal is made for erring sinners to return to God.

Now, what is wrong with all this? Why should any man object to this or go
out of his way to oppose its use in the house of God? Here is my answer:

1. IT VIOLATES THE SCRIPTURAL LAW OF HEARING.

The power of speech is a noble gift of God. In his ability to open his
mouth and by means of words make his fellows know what is going on inside
his mind, a man shares one of the prerogatives of the Creator. In its
ability to understand the spoken word the human mind rises unique above
all the lower creation. The gift which enables a man to translate abstract
ideas into sounds is a badge of his honor as made in the image of God.
Written or printed words are sound symbols and are translated by the mind
into hearing. Hieroglyphics and ideograms were the first symbols used to
represent ideas. These ideograms were, in effect, not pictures but
letters, and the letters were agreed-upon ideas. Thus words, whether
spoken or written, are a medium for the communication of ideas. This is
basic in human nature and stems from our divine origin.

It is significant that when God gave to mankind His great redemptive
revelation He couched it in words. 'And God spake all these words' very
well sums up the Bible's own account of how it got here. 'Thus saith the
Lord' is the constant refrain of the prophets. 'The words that I speak
unto you, they are spirit, and they are life,' said our Lord to His
hearers. Again He said, 'He that heareth my word, and believeth on him
that sent me, hath everlasting life.' Paul made WORDS and FAITH to be
inseparable: 'Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.'
And he also said, 'How shall they hear without a preacher?'

Surely it requires no genius to see that the Bible rules out pictures and
dramatics as media for bringing FAITH and LIFE to the human soul. The
plain fact is that no vital spiritual truth can be expressed by a picture.
Actually all any picture can do is to recall to mind some truth already
learned through the familiar medium of the spoken or written word.
Religious instruction and words are bound together by a living cord and
cannot be separated without fatal loss. The Spirit Himself, teaching
soundlessly within the heart, makes use of ideas previously received into
the mind by means of words.

If I am reminded that modern religious movies are 'sound' pictures, making
use of the human voice to augment the dramatic action, the answer is easy.
Just as far as the movie depends upon spoken words it makes pictures
unnecessary; the picture is the very thing that differentiates between the
movie and the sermon. The movie addresses its message primarily to the
eye, and the ear only incidentally. Were the message addressed to the ear
as in the Scriptures, the PICTURE would have no meaning and could be
omitted without loss to the intended effect. Words can say all that God
intends them to say, and this they can do without the aid of pictures.

According to one popular theory the mind receives through the eye five
times as much information as the ear. As far as the external shell of
physical facts is concerned this may hold good, but when we come to
spiritual truth we are in another world entirely. In that world the outer
eye is not too important. God addresses His message to the hearing ear.
'We look,' says Paul, 'not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the
things which are not seen are eternal.' This agrees with the whole burden
of the Bible, which teaches us that we should withdraw our eyes from
beholding visible things, and fasten the eyes of our hearts upon God while
we reverently listen to His uttered words. 'The word is nigh thee, even in
thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.'
Here, and not somewhere else, is the New Testament pattern, and no human
being, and no angel from heaven has any right to alter that pattern.

2. THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE EMBODIES THE MISCHIEVOUS NOTION THAT RELIGION IS,
OR CAN BE MADE, A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT.

This notion has come upon us lately LIKE A TIDAL WAVE and is either openly
taught or tacitly assumed by increasing numbers of people. Since it is
inextricably bound up with the subject under discussion I had better say
more about it.

The idea that religion should be entertaining has made some radical
changes in the evangelical picture within this generation. It has given us
not only the 'gospel' movie but a new type of religious journalism as
well. It has created a new kind of magazine for church people, which can
be read from cover to cover without effort, without thought - and without
profit. It has also brought a veritable flood of religious fiction with
plastic heroines and bloodless heroes like no one who has ever lived upon
this well known terrestrial ball.

That religion and amusement are forever opposed to each other by their
very essential natures is apparently not known to this new school of
religious entertainers. Their effort to SLIP UP ON THE READER AND
ADMINISTER A QUICK SHOT OF SAVING TRUTH while his mind is on something
else is not only futile, it is, in fact, not too far short of being plain
dishonest. The hope that they can convert a man while he is occupied with
the doings of some imaginary hero reminds one of the story of the Catholic
missionary who used to sneak up on sick people and children and splash a
little holy water on them to guarantee their passage to the city of gold.

I believe that most responsible religious teachers will agree that any
effort to teach spiritual truth through entertainment is at best futile
and at worst positively injurious to the soul. But entertainment pays off,
and THE ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION is always a powerful one in deciding what
shall and what shall not be offered to the public -even in the churches.

Deep spiritual experiences come only from much study, earnest prayer and
long meditation. It is true that men by thinking cannot find God; it is
also true that men cannot know God very well without a lot of reverent
thinking. Religious movies, by appealing directly to the shallowest
stratum of our minds, CANNOT BUT CREATE BAD MENTAL HABITS which unfit the
soul for the reception of genuine spiritual impressions.

Religious movies are mistakenly thought by some people to be blessed of
the Lord BECAUSE MANY COME AWAY FROM THEM WITH MOIST EYES. If this is a
proof of God's blessing, then we might as well go the whole way and assert
that every show that brings tears is of God. Those who attend the theater
know how often the audiences are moved to tears by the joys and sorrows of
the highly paid entertainers who kiss and emote and murder and die for the
purpose of exciting the spectators to a high pitch of emotional
excitement. Men and women who are dedicated to sin and appointed to death
may nevertheless weep in sympathy for the painted actors and be not one
bit the better for it. The emotions have had a beautiful time, but the
will is left untouched. The religious movie is sure to draw together a
goodly number of persons who cannot distinguish the twinges of vicarious
sympathy from the true operations of the Holy Ghost.

3. THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE IS A MENACE TO TRUE RELIGION BECAUSE IT EMBODIES
ACTING, A VIOLATION OF SINCERITY.

Without doubt the most precious thing any man possesses is his
individuated being; that by which he is himself and not someone else; that
which cannot be finally voided by the man himself nor shared with another.
Each one of us, however humble our place in the social scheme, is unique
in creation. Each is a new whole man possessing his own separate 'I-ness'
which makes him forever something apart, an individual human being. It is
this quality of uniqueness which permits a man to enjoy every reward of
virtue and makes him responsible for every sin. It is his 'selfness,'
which will persist forever, and which distinguishes him from every
creature which has been or ever will be created.

Because man is such a being as this all moral teachers, and especially
Christ and His apostles, make sincerity to be basic in the good life. The
word, as the New Testament uses it, refers to the practice of holding fine
pottery up to the sun to test it for purity. In the white light of the sun
all foreign substances were instantly exposed. So the test of sincerity is
basic in human character. The sincere man is one in whom is found nothing
foreign; he is all of one piece; he has preserved his individuality
unviolated.

Sincerity for each man means 'staying in character with himself.' Christ's
controversy with the Pharisees centered around their incurable habit of
moral play acting. The Pharisee constantly pretended to be what he was
not. He attempted to vacate his own 'I-ness' and appear in that of another
and better man. He assumed a false character and played it for effect.
Christ said he was a hypocrite.

It is more than an etymological accident that the word 'hypocrite' comes
from the stage. It means ACTOR. With that instinct for fitness which
usually marks word origins, it has been used to signify one who has
violated his sincerity and is playing a false part. An actor is one who
assumes a character other than his own and plays it for effect. The more
fully he can become possessed by another personality the better he is as
an actor. Bacon has said something to the effect that there are some
professions of such nature that the more skillfully a man can work at them
the worse man he is. That perfectly describes the profession of acting.
Stepping out of our own character for any reason is always dangerous, and
may be fatal to the soul. However innocent his intentions, a man who
assumes a false character has betrayed his own soul and has deeply injured
something sacred within him.

No one who has been in the presence of the Most Holy One, who has felt how
high is the solemn privilege of bearing His image, will ever again consent
to play a part or to TRIFLE WITH THAT MOST SACRED THING, his own deep
sincere heart. He will thereafter be constrained to be no one but himself,
to preserve reverently the sincerity of his own soul. In order to produce
a religious movie someone must, for the time, disguise his individuality
and simulate that of another. His actions must be judged fraudulent, and
those who watch them with approval share in the fraud. TO PRETEND TO PRAY,
to simulate godly sorrow, TO PLAT AT WORSHIP before the camera for effect
- how utterly shocking to the reverent heart! How can Christians who
approve this gross pretense ever understand the value of sincerity as
taught by our Lord? WHAT WILL BE THE END OF A GENERATION OF CHRISTIANS FED
ON SUCH A DIET OF DECEPTION DISGUISED AS THE FAITH OF OUR FATHERS?

The plea that all this must be good because it is done for the glory of
God is a gossamer-thin bit of rationalizing which should not fool anyone
above the mental age of six. Such an argument parallels the evil rule of
expediency which holds the END IS EVERYTHING, and sanctifies the means,
however evil, if only the end be commendable. The wise student of history
will recognize this immoral doctrine. The Spirit-led Church will have no
part of it.

It is not uncommon to find around the theater human flotsam and jetsam
washed up by the years, men and women who have played false parts so long
that the power to be sincere has forever gone from them. They are doomed
to everlasting duplicity. Every act of their lives is faked, every smile
is false, every tone of their voice artificial. The curse does not come
causeless. It is not by chance that the actor's profession has been
notoriously dissolute. Hollywood and Broadway are two sources of
corruption which may yet turn America into a Sodom and lay her glory in
the dust.

The profession of acting did not originate with the Hebrews. It is not a
part of the divine pattern. The Bible mentions it, but never approves it.
Drama, as it has come down to us, had its rise in Greece. It was
originally a part of the worship of the god Dionysus and was carried on
with drunken revelry. The Miracle Plays of medieval times have been
brought forward to justify the modern religious movie. That is an
unfortunate weapon to choose for the defense of the movie, for it will
surely harm the man who uses it more than any argument I could think of
just offhand. The Miracle Plays had their big run in the Middle Ages. They
were dramatic performances with religious themes staged for the
entertainment of the populace. At their best they were misguided efforts
to teach spiritual truths by dramatic representation; at their worst they
were shockingly irreverent and thoroughly reprehensible. In some of them
the Eternal God was portrayed as an old man dressed in white with a gilt
wig! To furnish low comedy, the devil himself was introduced on the stage
and allowed to cavort FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE SPECTATORS. Bible themes
were used, as in the modern movie, but this did not save the whole thing
from becoming so corrupt that the Roman Church had finally to prohibit its
priests from having any further part in it. Those who would appeal for
precedent to the Miracle Plays have certainly overlooked some important
facts. For instance, the vogue of the Miracle Play COINCIDED EXACTLY WITH
THE MOST DISMALLY CORRUPT PERIOD the Church has ever known. [Ed. Romanism
never had a true church]. When the Church emerged at last from its long
moral night these plays lost popularity and finally passed away. And be it
remembered, THE INSTRUMENT GOD USED to bring the Church out of the
darkness was not drama; it was the biblical one of Spirit-baptized
preaching. Serious-minded men thundered the truth and the people turned to
God.

Indeed, history will show that no spiritual advance, no revival, no
upsurge of spiritual life HAS EVER BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ACTING IN ANY
FORM. The Holy Spirit never honors pretense.

Can it be that the historic pattern is being repeated? That the appearance
of the religious movie IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE LOW STATE OF SPIRITUAL HEALTH
WE ARE IN TODAY? I fear so. Only the absence of the Holy Spirit from the
pulpit and lack of true discernment on the part of professing Christians
can account for the spread of religious drama among so-called evangelical
churches. A SPIRIT-FILLED CHURCH COULD NOT TOLERATE IT.

4. THEY WHO PRESENT THE GOSPEL MOVIE OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO GIVE BIBLICAL
AUTHORITY FOR THEIR ACT: AND THIS THEY HAVE NOT DONE.

The Church, as long as it is following the Lord, goes along in Bible ways
and can give a scriptural reason for its conduct. Its members meet at
stated times to pray together: This has biblical authority back of it.
They gather to hear the Word of God expounded: this goes back in almost
unbroken continuity to Moses. They sing psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs: so they are commanded by the apostle. They visit the sick and
relieve the sufferings of the poor: for this they have both precept and
example in Holy Writ. They lay up their gifts and bring them at stated
times to the church or chapel to be used in the Lord's work: this also
follows the scriptural pattern. They teach and train and instruct; they
appoint teachers and pastors and missionaries and send them out to do the
work for which the Spirit has gifted them: all this has plain scriptural
authority behind it.

Now, FOR THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE WHERE IS THE AUTHORITY? For such a serious
departure from the ancient pattern, where is the authority? For
introducing into the Church the pagan art of acting, where is the
authority? Let the movie advocates quote just ONE verse, from any book of
the Bible, in any translation, to justify its use. This they cannot do.
The best they can do is to appeal to the world's psychology or repeat
brightly that 'modern times call for modern methods.' But the Scriptures -
quote from them one verse to authorize movie acting as an instrument of
the Holy Ghost. This they cannot do. Every sincere Christian must find
scriptural authority for the religious movie or reject it, and every
producer of such movies, if he would square himself before the faces of
honest and reverent men, must either show scriptural credentials or go out
of business.

But, says someone, there is nothing unscriptural about the religious
movie; it is merely a NEW MEDIUM for the utterance of the old message, as
printing is a newer and better method of writing and the radio an
amplification of familiar human speech. To this I reply: The movie is not
the modernization or improvement of any scriptural method; rather IT IS A
MEDIUM IN ITSELF WHOLLY FOREIGN TO THE BIBLE and altogether unauthorized
therein. It is play acting - just that, and nothing more. It is the
introduction into the work of God of that which is not neutral, but
entirely bad. The printing press is neutral; so is the radio; so is the
camera. They may be used for good or bad purposes at the will of the user.
But play acting is bad in its essence in that it involves the simulation
of emotions not actually felt. It embodies a gross moral contradiction in
that it calls a lie to the service of truth.

Arguments for the religious movie are sometimes clever and always shallow,
but there is never any real attempt to cite scriptural authority. Anything
that can be said for the movie can be said also for aesthetic dancing,
which is a highly touted medium for teaching religious truth by appeal to
the eye. Its advocates grow eloquent in its praise - but where is it
indicated in the blueprint?

5. GOD HAS ORDAINED FOUR METHODS ONLY BY WHICH TRUTH SHALL PREVAIL - AND
THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

Without attempting to arrange these methods in order of importance, they
are prayer, song, proclamation of the message by means of words, and good
works. These are the four main methods which God has blessed. All other
biblical methods are sub-divisions of these and stay within their
framework. The whole PREACH-THE-GOSPEL-WITH-MOVIES idea is founded upon
the same basic assumptions as Modernism, namely, that the Word of God is
not final, and that we of this day have a perfect right to add to it or
alter it WHEREVER WE THINK WE CAN IMPROVE IT.

A brazen example of this attitude came to my attention recently.
Preliminary printed matter has been sent out announcing that a new
organization is in process of being formed. It is to be called the
'International Radio and Screen Artists Guild,' and one of its two major
objectives is to promote the movie as a medium for the spread of the
gospel. Its sponsors, apparently, are not Modernists, but confessed
Fundamentalists. Some of its declared purposes are: to produce movies
'with or without a Christian slant'; to raise and maintain higher
standards in the movie field (this would be done, it says here, by having
'much prayer' with leaders of the movie industry); to 'challenge people,
especially young people, to those fields as they are challenged to go to
foreign fields.' This last point should not be allowed to pass without
some of us doing a little challenging on our own account. Does this new
organization actually propose in seriousness to add another gift to the
gifts of the Spirit listed in the New Testament? To the number of the
Spirit's gifts, such as pastor, teacher, evangelist, is there now to be
added another, 'the gift of the movie actor?' Instead of the Holy Spirit
saying, 'Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
called them,' these people will make use of what they call a 'Christian
talent listing,' to consist of the names of 'Christian' actors who have
received the Spirit's gift to be used in making religious movies. Thus the
order set up in the New Testament is openly violated, and by professed
lovers of the gospel who say unto Jesus, 'Lord, Lord,' but openly set
aside His Lordship whenever they desire. No amount of smooth talk can
explain away this serious act of insubordination. Saul lost a kingdom when
he 'forced' himself and took profane liberties with the priesthood. Let
these movie preachers look to their crown. They may find themselves on the
road to Endor some dark night soon.

6. THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE IS OUT OF HARMONY WITH THE WHOLE SPIRIT OF THE
SCRIPTURES AND CONTRARY TO THE MOOD OF TRUE GODLINESS.

To harmonize the spirit of the religious movie with the spirit of the
Sacred Scriptures is impossible. Any comparison is grotesque and, if it
were not so serious, would be downright funny. Try to imagine Elijah
appearing before Ahab with a roll of film! Imagine Peter standing up at
Pentecost and saying, 'Let's have the lights out, please.' When Jeremiah
hesitated to prophesy, on the plea that he was not a fluent speaker, God
touched his mouth and said, 'I have put my words in thy mouth.' Perhaps
Jeremiah could have gotten on well enough without the divine touch if he
had had a good 16mm projector and a reel of home-talent film.

Let a man dare to compare his religious movie show with the spirit of the
Book of Acts. Let him try to find a place for it in the twelfth chapter of
First Corinthians. If he cannot see the difference in kind, then he is too
blind to be trusted with leadership in the Church of the Living God. The
only thing that he can do appropriate to the circumstances is to drop to
his knees and cry with poor Bartimaeus, 'Lord, that I might receive my
sight.'

But some say, 'We do not propose to displace the regular method of
preaching the gospel. We only want to supplement it.' To this I answer: If
the movie is needed to supplement anointed preaching it can only be
because God's appointed method is inadequate and the movie can do
something which God's appointed method cannot do. What is that thing? We
freely grant that the movie can produce effects which preaching cannot
produce (and which it should never try to produce), but dare we strive for
such effects in the light of God's revealed will and in the face of the
judgment and a long eternity?

7. I AM AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE BECAUSE OF THE HARMFUL EFFECT UPON
EVERYONE ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

First, the evil effect upon the 'actors' who play the part of the various
characters in the show; this is not the less because it is unsuspected.
Who can, while in a state of fellowship with God, dare to PLAY at being a
prophet? Who has the gall to PRETEND to be an apostle, even in a show?
WHERE IS HIS REVERENCE? Where is his fear? Where is his humility? Any one
who can bring himself to act a part for any purpose, must first have
grieved the Spirit and silenced His voice within the heart. Then the whole
business will appear good to him. 'He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart
has turned him aside.' But he cannot escape the secret working of the
ancient laws of the soul. Something high and fine and grand will die
within him; and worst of all he will never suspect it. That is the curse
that follows self-injury always. The Pharisees were examples of this. They
were walking dead men, and they never dreamed how dead they were.

Secondly, it identifies religion with the theatrical world. I have seen
recently in a Fundamentalist magazine an advertisement of a religious film
which would be altogether at home on the theatrical page on any city
newspaper. ILLUSTRATED WITH THE USUAL SEX-BATE PICTURE of a young man and
young woman in tender embrace, and spangled with such words as
'feature-length, drama, pathos, romance,' it reeked of Hollywood and the
cheap movie house. BY SUCH BUSINESS WE ARE SELLING OUT OUR CHRISTIAN
SEPARATION, AND NOTHING BUT GRIEF CAN COME OF IT LATE OR SOON.

Thirdly, THE TASTE FOR DRAMA which these pictures develop in the minds of
the young WILL NOT LONG REMAIN SATISFIED WITH THE INFERIOR STUFF THE
RELIGIOUS MOVIE CAN OFFER. Our young people will demand the real thing;
and what can we reply WHEN THEY ASK WHY THEY SHOULD NOT PATRONIZE THE
REGULAR MOVIE HOUSE?

Fourthly, the rising generation will naturally come to LOOK UPON RELIGION
AS ANOTHER, AND INFERIOR, FORM OF AMUSEMENT. In fact, the present
generation has done this to an alarming extent already, and the gospel
movie feeds the notion by fusing religion and fun in the name of
orthodoxy. IT TAKES NO GREAT INSIGHT TO SEE THAT THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE MUST
BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE THRILLING AS THE TASTES OF THE SPECTATORS BECOME
MORE AND MORE STIMULATED.

Fifthly, the religious movie is the lazy preacher's friend. If the present
vogue continues to spread it will not be long before any man with enough
ability to make an audible prayer, and mentality enough to focus a
projector, will be able to pass for a prophet of the Most High God. The
man of God can play around all week long and come up to the Lord's Day
without a care. Everything has been done for him at the studio. He has
only to set up the screen and lower the lights, and the rest follows
painlessly.

Wherever the movie is used the prophet is displaced by the projector. The
least that such displaced prophets can do is to admit that they are
technicians and not preachers. Let them admit that they are not God-sent
men, ordained of God for a sacred work. Let them put away their pretense.

IN CONCLUSION

One thing may bother some earnest souls: WHY SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE APPROVE
THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE. If it is an evil, why have not these denounced it?
The answer is, LACK OF SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT. Many who are turning to the
movie are the same who have, by direct teaching or by neglect, discredited
the work of the Holy Spirit. They have apologized for the Spirit and so
hedged Him in by their unbelief that it has amounted to an out-and-out
repudiation. Now we are paying the price for our folly. The light has gone
out and good men are forced to stumble around in the darkness of the human
intellect.

THE RELIGIOUS MOVIE IS AT PRESENT UNDERGOING A PERIOD OF GESTATION AND
SEEMS ABOUT TO SWARM OVER THE CHURCHES LIKE A CLOUD OF LOCUSTS OUT OF THE
EARTH. The figure is accurate; they are coming from below, not from above.
The whole modern psychology has been prepared for this invasion of
insects. The Fundamentalists have become weary of manna and are longing
for red flesh. What they are getting is a sorry substitute for the lusty
and uninhibited pleasures of the world, and IT SAVES FACE BY PRETENDING TO
BE SPIRITUAL. Let us not for the sake of peace keep still while men
without spiritual insight dictate the diet upon which God's children shall
feed. The religious movie represents amateurism gone wild. Unity among
professing Christians is to be desired, but not at the expense of
righteousness. It is good to go with the flock, but I refuse mutely to
follow a misled flock over a precipice. If God has given wisdom to see the
error of religious shows we owe it to the Church to oppose them openly. We
dare not take refuge in 'guilty silence.' Error is not silent; it is
highly vocal and amazingly aggressive. We dare not be less so." (A.W.
Tozer)

WHO STOLE THAT BIBLE VERSE?

If you are new to this subject, go and get your NIV and read Acts 8:37....Not there is it?

Try shaking the book. Where did it go? It is a good verse. It is a very clear verse that shows a person is to become a Christian BEFORE he gets baptized. I wonder who would have taken such an important doctrinal proof-text out?:

â€œBaptism, which is the sacrmanet of faith, without which, justification never befel any man.â€
(Canons of Trent)

You still donâ€™t know who would have stolen THAT Bible verse? Donâ€™t worry, the KJV still has it in there.

IN THE NEWS

â€œIn 1995, the world stood by while the Croatian Army evicted 350,000 Serbs from lands that they had lived in since the fourth century. Today, the unanswered question regarding ethnic cleansing in the Balkans remains. Why were the Serbs of Krajina less deserving of protection than the Albanians of Kosovo?â€
(John Doggett , WorldNetDaily)

â€œThe families of three teenagers murdered in the Paducah, Kentucky school shooting are suing the entertainment industry for $100 million in damages, claiming the violence the industry produces influenced the young man who shot their children. The Hollywood profiteers may walk by claiming their product was an exercise of their First Amendment rights, but Hollywood is a much more logical legal target than gun manufacturers.â€
[The Federalist (www.Federalist.com)]

[Comments: First it was the tobacco industry, then the gun manufacturers. Will churches be next? Now, I hate tobacco products. I think people would be better off using the stuff as an insecticide in their gardens instead of sticking it in their bodies, polluting their health and becoming a slave to it. Nevertheless, if the world is to continue in this game of suing people for the irresponsibility of others it is obvious that the most culpable people on earth will be found in the alcohol industry and Hollywood! And what about MTV and the music industry? If we will convict people for â€œhate crimesâ€ then certainly we must take on the music industry for â€œcausingâ€ children to hate their parents and authority. And what about network television? Certainly television producers should be sued for not only â€œcausingâ€ homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, violence, divorce, but above all, rampant stupidity!]

â€œAnti-Semitism is increasing. The number of anti-Semitic acts committed around the world last year increased for the first time in three years, an annual survey by Israeli researchers said. Incidents of vandalism, violence, and hate speech against Jews increased because of instability in the former Soviet republics, the publicizing of financial compensations of Jewish Holocaust victims, and stalled peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the Jerusalem Post said.â€
(Religion Today, 4-14-99)

[Comments: Jesus Christ was a Jew, therefore the Devil will never forgive that people. As evil increases, Israel and the Jews will more and more become the center of world-wide animosity simply for their association with Jesus Christ and the Devilâ€™s added hatred of literal OT prophecy concerning their nation.]

CHRISTIAN ROCK: SEXUAL EVANGELISM?

â€œA Christian rock â€™nâ€™ roll concert was held in an unusual place - the Hard Rock CafÃ© in Orlando, Fla. The March 25 event featured the Newsboys and Big Tent Revival. It is one of a series of Christian contemporary concerts being planned for the facility. Steve Cox, Hard Rock CafÃ©â€™s general manager and a member of St. Lukeâ€™s United Methodist Church, says he started the series to reach teen-agers who donâ€™t ordinarily attend church.â€

When a high ranking Republican (U.S. Representative Tom Davis) addressed a sodomite organization not too long ago, the homosexual community responded, â€œHe showed by [coming] that he is willing to work with us...Hopefully, this will spur others on....Davis has been front and center in opposing anti-Gay stuff...â€ (New American, p.9, April, 1999) In other words, this gesture was received by the â€œgayâ€ community as a compromise, a â€œwink, a â€œpat on the backâ€ that they may continue in their present lifestyle and still be â€œincludedâ€ as â€œgood-oleâ€™-boyâ€ supporters. What message then do Christians send to the world by â€œrocking and rolling all nightâ€ at the Hard Rock Cafe? Is the message not the same? Does not the world take this as a â€œpat on the backâ€? A â€œwinkâ€? A confession that the Christian life is really boring and that â€œrockersâ€ are really having all the fun?

By the way, perhaps some of these Christians can explain what Paul Stanley and the world means by â€œrock and roll all nightâ€. Can you have â€œrock and rollâ€ without some kind of rebellion and unlawful sexual connotation? (The phrase was of course a sexual euphemism heard in R&amp;B songs long before DJ Alan Freed introduced it to the mainstream in 1952.) Is it not obvious why so many of those caught up in â€œChristian rockâ€ (or â€œChristian alternativeâ€ or whatever is the latest thing) are involved in fornication? Why are so many living together out of wedlock? Why does fornication spread around churches to the degree that worldly popular music is encouraged? Could the reason be that â€œrock â€˜nâ€™ rollâ€ stands for unlawful sex and rebellion, is meant to â€œsoundâ€ like unlawful sex and rebellion, and is meant to communicate and encourage unlawful sex and rebellion?!

Back in 1975, the December issue of Time reported that in a Florida school for unwed mothers 964 girls out of 1000 admitted to having committed fornication while listening to rock music. Nothing has changed today. It has only become worse. Listen to the singers of some popular â€œChristianâ€ music and notice how the producers are now going for a â€œbedroom-cigarette-wine-glassâ€ effect in the vocalists. They are trying to make it sound like they are waking up after a rough night of boozing and â€œyou know whatâ€. This sells. Why is it that those Christians that will argue most about defending the â€œrock and rollâ€ image, look, music, etc. are nine times out of ten the same people living with someone out of wedlock, divorcing or having children out of wedlock? (If they are not presently, sadly many are well on the way as the seeds they have planted begin to sprout.) The answer is simple; and everyone really knows it, even if they wonâ€™t admit it:

â€œ"[In its] very beat and sound it has always implicitly rejected restraints and has celebrated freedom in sexuality ."
(Time Magazine)

â€œThough students do not have books, they most emphatically do have music. Nothing is more singular about this generation than its addiction to music....rock music has one appeal only, a barbaric appeal, to sexual desire â€“ not love, not eros, but sexual desire undeveloped and untutored....Young people know that rock has the beat of sexual intercourse ...The inevitable corollary of such sexual interest is rebellion against the parental authority that represses it....Marxists certainly do see that rock music dissolves the beliefs and morals necessary for liberal society and would approve of it for that alone...the essential character of musical entertainment is not changing. There is only a constant search for variations on the theme....Rock music provides premature ecstasy and, in this respect, is like the drugs with which it is allied."
(Alan Bloom, â€œThe Closing of the American Mindâ€)

"Rock is the total celebration of the physical."
(Ted Nugent, â€œRolling Stoneâ€)

â€œ"The rock'n'roll school in general concentrated on a minimum of melodic line and a maximum of rhythmic noise, deliberately competing with the artistic ideals of the jungle itself."
(Encyclopedia Britannicaâ€™s Year End Review, 1954)

"Rock â€˜nâ€™ roll is 99% sex."
(John Oates of Hall &amp; Oates)

"Thatâ€™s what rock is all about - sex with a 100 megaton bomb, the beat!"
(Gene Simmons, Kiss)

"Rock music is sex. The big beat matches the bodyâ€™s rhythms."
(Frank Zappa)

"Rock music has always been the devil's music. It lets in the baser elements."
(David Bowie)

"Listen, rock'n roll AIN'T CHURCH. It's nasty business. You gotta be nasty too. If you're goody, goody, you can't sing or play it. . ."
(Lita Ford, â€œLos Angeles Timesâ€, August 7, 1988)

"Rock â€˜nâ€™ roll is all sex. One hundred percent sex."
(Debbie Harry, Blondie)

"In all pop music lyrics are secondary. Pop is music of feeling, spoken primarily to the body and only secondarily to the intellect."
(Graham Cray, former Chairman of the Greenbelt Committee, Greenbelt Christian Rock Concerts).

"Rock music is sex and you have to hit them in the face with it."
(Andrew Oldham, recording manager of the Rolling Stones)

I have heard many Christian musicians say that if they talk too much about Jesus Christ it will â€œdrive people away." They will not like it. Therefore, what they are saying is that they desire to please people. It is the same with the music. From the above quotes it is a cold, hard fact that the rebellious youth of the world will not â€œrelateâ€ to anything that does not sound like rebellion and sex. If you will â€œrelateâ€ to them, you will have to dress, act, talk, sing and play in a way that communicates rebellion and unlawful sex. he same kids that do not want Jesus in the lyrics are the kids that do want sex and rebellion in the music and image.

It seems the message today from many Christians is: â€œPeople are not holy anymore. All they want to do is party and rock â€˜nâ€™ roll all night. They donâ€™t want to hear preaching, and they donâ€™t care about studying the Bible and all that â€œdryâ€ stuff. At least if we go party with them we may have â€œsomeâ€ effect on them; I mean, they certainly are not going to step foot in a church.â€ Notice, the issue is not whether Christians should go and preach, disciple and evangelize people that do not want to hear the truth; the issue is whether or not Christians should go and provide entertainment to worldly rebels as a substitute for preaching. Who are they trying to kid anyway? It is â€œworldlyâ€ Christians that fill up those â€œChristianâ€ rock concerts, not the lost.

This is an issue I am qualified to speak on for many reasons. Before coming to the knowledge of the truth I was a â€œhard rockâ€ guitarist. I have taught guitar (all styles) full-time for 15 years. One young man just told me (and I am saddened by it) that there are rock guitarists playing in clubs all over Texas that have been taught by me. Furthermore, when young in the ministry we flirted with the whole â€œChristian rockâ€, â€œalternative churchâ€ movement and have been able to see the ultimate, sour fruit of it all. (Donâ€™t point a finger at me buddy; where were YOU before you got saved and grew up?)

Therefore, here is what I think is the truth of the matter: It is not that the Hard Rock Cafe has somehow become holy enough to allow and encourage â€œChristianâ€ entertainment. No, it is that the Christian entertainment has now become so worldly that even the Hard Rock Cafe now finds it â€œacceptableâ€!

But what about those few kids that may â€œbe movedâ€ to perhaps go to church after a â€œChristianâ€ rock concert or two? It is an absolute fact that many more young Christian souls will â€œbe movedâ€ to LEAVE church and backslide after being tempted to enter clubs and bars under the exciting, â€œsanctifiedâ€ rationalization that a â€œChristianâ€ rock band is playing in them! Their holy zeal will be put out like wind on a match. After fellowshipping with the world and experiencing the fun of â€œnight club churchâ€ on Saturday evening at the local Hard Rock Cafe, multitudes of young Christians will then find churches that emphasize Bible study early Sunday morning quite dreadful in comparison!:

"Rock concerts are the churches of today.â€
(Craig Chaquico, Jefferson Airplane guitarist)

Thus, you will have this result: As kids leave traditional churches (having had a stumbling block placed before them, Mtt.18), to keep them in, tons of churches will find that they must actually become more like the local Hard Rock Cafe! Churches will increasingly have to be transformed into night clubs to keep the youth who have been tempted by the new â€œconcert spiritualityâ€ (2Tim.3:5). Many churches will undergo this transformation in the name of modern evangelism toward the youth (you know, â€œif you get the kids you get the parentsâ€, etc.).

And there you have it. That is where we are at today: Corrupting Christians to do good to the world through leaning to our own understanding. Yet, the Bible places the order the other way around:

Galatians 6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

Just a note in closing. In the early 1800â€™s, Anthony Norris Groves left an extremely profitable business and inheritance to travel to become an independent missionary in a foreign land where he watched his wife die of some plague. Now the desire of multitudes of young Christians is to get fame and glory, grab a guitar and â€œParty man! Rock &amp; Roll for JC, dude! Spread the Word!â€ It is the dream of the masses programmed into their minds by flirting with television and secular radio.

Music itself has become primarily self-gratifying entertainment, and it is given such a focus by Christians that you would think it was on every page of the New Testament. Many Christians cannot even discuss the issue without getting in the flesh. It has become an addiction. In light of all of these reasons (and many more) I cannot advocate using â€œrock musicâ€ to â€œsupposedlyâ€ evangelize the world. Can Satan cast out Satan?

I HOPE

I hope in God's mercy

and the promises of His word

I hope in New Jerusalem

and in His kingdom to come

I hope for Israel

that their eyes should be opened

I hope for my family

to see God's glory

I hope in the resurrection

I pray not to fall

I hope in my labour

That my Father will recall

I hope for patience

that cannot be seen

I hope in His judgments

that will find my garments clean

I hope in my Savior

I hope for my friends

I hope to see all of you

on that shore by the sea

I Hope

(by Marc Mitchum)

ENCOURAGEMENT TO PRAY

Hudson Taylor, on his first trip to China, was on board a sailing boat that was all but driven by the tide on shore where cannibals awaited them. The Captain of the boat became frantic. Knowing that Mr. Taylor was a man of God, he anxiously went to him. â€˜Mr. Taylor,â€™ he said, â€˜I have done everything that can be done to save the people on my boat. In a very short time now our boat will be on shore. We will all be caught and eaten unless your God helps us. You believe in a God who answers prayer - pray that He will save us.â€™

â€˜I will,â€™ responded Mr. Taylor, â€˜providing you will set your sails to catch the wind which my God will send.â€™ â€˜You mean set my sails when there is not a breath of air stirring?â€™ asked the captain. â€˜Why, I cannot do that. I would become the laughing stock of the entire crew. No, I will set the sails after God has answered your prayers.â€™ â€˜Then I will not pray,â€™ Mr. Taylor firmly answered. â€˜If you do not have enough faith in my God to set your sails, then I will not call upon Him for help.â€™ When the captain realized that Mr. Taylor meant what he said he threw aside his pride and set the sails as if the wind were up and blowing in the right direction. In the meantime, Mr. Taylor went to his knees calling upon God for help. After some time Mr. Taylor heard a knock at his door. â€˜Who is there?â€™ he asked. â€˜It is Iâ€™, the captain responded. â€˜Are you still praying for the wind?â€™ â€˜yes, I am,â€™ answered Mr. Taylor. â€˜Well, â€˜ replied the captain, â€˜youâ€™d better stop praying, for we have more wind than we can manage already.â€
(From â€œThe Praying Life,â€ Panton)

WORDS WORTH REMEMBERING

â€œ..the Coming of Christ, considered as a testimony, is so bound up with the varied doctrines of the Word of God that it is impossible to neglect it without producing a fatal lack of emphasis in any doctrine preached.â€
(I.M. Haldeman, â€œhow To Study The Bibleâ€)

â€œIt is an awful fact that there are some that will be â€˜scarcely savedâ€™ - saved because of faith in Jesus Christ, but whose whole life will have been practically thrown away, because what they labored for, has been what perishes....when I behold millions upon millions of the human race standing before the bar of God to receive the sentence of final destiny, and remember that not one soul in all the millions of the saved I have brought to a knowledge of Christ, and not one soul in all the millions of the lost, I have turned away from the absorbing devotion to the things that perish!...All past years are gone forever, with their opportunities. Shall we continue pursuing the same course that we have been? Shall we live for this world or the world to come?â€
(A.T. Pierson, â€œThe Bible And Spiritual Lifeâ€)

â€œFrom the action of Christâ€™s blessing infants, to infer that they were baptized, proves nothing so much as that there is want of better argument; for the conclusion would with more probability be derived thus: Christ blessed children and so dismissed them, but baptized them not, therefore infants are not to be baptized.â€
(Jeremy Taylor)

        <h1>ANOTHER ANTI-ACCOUNTABILITY DIATRIBE BY HERB EVANS</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Herb Evans, who has written some good things on the King James Bible controversy, has nevertheless been too "hotheaded" to study the issue of accountability at the Judgment Seat properly and soberly. We both believe in eternal security. But he had better face some sobering facts:

If the warnings to Christians do not speak of the Millennium, then they must speak of eternal damnation. Herb Evans would have a more defensible position (though wrong) if he adopted either hyper-Calvinism or Arminianism (yet he opposes both). He is one of those, "I don't need to read the book because I already know" types. My book was not hammered on his own anvil, so therefore it must be wrong. It is new to him, so it must be wrong - even though he currently contends for certain things that were "rediscovered" by men in history who also contended for Millennial exclusion, as I do. For example, Evans contends for a secret, pre-tribulational coming of the Lord - before a FUTURE, literal Tribulation period (not historicism). In eternity, he may thank Robert Govett for rediscovering that doctrine in the 19th century. In regard to the fact that the 1260 days of the Tribulation period are future and literal, he may also thank William Burgh and Robert Govett - both contenders for Millennial exclusion. This all means nothing other than the fact that it is inconsistent to respond to Kingdom exclusion in his reckless, bitter manner and accuse it of being contrary to the tradition of the present, Baptist elders (he can only make this claim since the 1950's or 60's), while he at the same time HOLDS doctrines that were likewise resisted by men in the 19th century with his same attitude and spirit.

After Herb Evans wrote numerous articles and e-mails against my book, I offered to debate him on the subject in a formal manner. It is in a formal debate that the weaknesses of a position can be adequately manifested. Herb Evans has consistently refused to debate the issue of the Judgment Seat of Christ in a formal manner. For that matter, so has every other detractor I have, so far, run across. On the other hand, Mr. Evans has continued to write doctrinal snippets against my position. Most of these I have since ignored. But perhaps a reply to Mr. Evan's latest diatribe will be useful to those who are discussing this issue with objectors, or to those who are seeking more light upon the subject of a Christian's accountability in general.

Herb Evans writes:

"Whosoever therefore shall BREAK one of these LEAST COMMANDMENTS, and shall teach men so, he shall be called LEAST IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called GREAT IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. For I say unto you, That except your RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL EXCEED the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall IN NO CASE ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. - Matthew 5:19,20 - Joey Faust attempts through the power of suggestion, misplaced proof text, misinterpreted proof texts, innuendo, erroneously linked proof texts, inference, pontification, and pat answers to advance his cause of making a distinction between the carnal and the non carnal and is still unable to do it."

That's a nice list of accusations. But let's see if he proves any of them. It appears that he has adopted the hyper-Calvinist view that there is no such thing as a carnal Christian. This is a strange doctrine for Mr. Evans since he is a staunch anti-Calvinist. How is it that he has apparently adopted Calvin's doctrine of the PERSEVERANCE of the saints without any of the other supporting doctrines? I certainly believe in the eternal PRESERVATION of the saints (notice the different word). But to state that there is no distinction between a carnal Christian and a non-carnal one (thus apparently denying that a Christian can be carnal) is to teach Calvin's doctrine of PERSEVERANCE. We will let Mr. Evans tells us how ALL saints PERSEVERE IN HOLINESS without the doctrine of IRRESISTIBLE GRACE also being true. Mr. Evans has a strange mix of theologies here. If he decides to become a hyper-Calvinist to escape such inconsistencies, we will then ask him why God could not have elected some saints to MILLENNIAL shame and others to MILLENNIAL glory, if He has also elected some people to ETERNAL shame and others to ETERNAL glory. Calvin was not a premillennialist, and thus he could only apply his doctrine of election to one age to come. But in reality, there is the "world to come" (i.e. the Millennium), and the world AFTER the world to come (i.e., the eternal age).

It should be obvious to any Christian that a believer may walk in a carnal or fleshly manner:

1 Corinthians 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

2 Corinthians 12:21 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.

Herb Evans offers no proof-texts at all to deny the reality of carnal Christians.

Herb Evans writes:

"Here is a passage that makes a distinction between two groups of believers and the lost. Both groups of Christians end up in the kingdom of heaven, the one in the position of greatness and the other in the position of least. The lost are denied entrance into the kingdom of heaven, because they only have their own righteousness, which is not sufficient righteousness, even that righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is obtained by believing."

Mr. Evans is interpreting Matthew 5:20 to apply to UNBELIEVERS. He is interpreting the "righteousness" to be POSITIONAL righteousness (not practical). In other words, he is referring the passage to a believer's STANDING and not to his WALK. Let us take a look again at the verses under discussion:

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 For I SAY UNTO YOU, That except YOUR righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, YE shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

There has been no change of CONTEXT. No new characters have entered in. The "you" of verse 20 is the same people our Lord has been addressing in the previous verses:

Matthew 5:16 Let YOUR light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify YOUR Father which is in heaven.

Mr. Evans has first assumed the doctrine that believers cannot miss the Kingdom of Heaven for any reason or failing, regardless of how they live, and then he has used this assumption to forcefully INSERT unbelievers into the context of Matthew 5:20. What we have here in Matthew 5 is very simple. The context is THE LORD'S DISCIPLES:

Matthew 5:1 And seeing the MULTITUDES, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, HIS DISCIPLES came unto him:
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught THEM...

The Lord first teaches His disciples in Matthew 5:19 the CONSEQUENCES for breaking the LEAST of HIS commandments:

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these LEAST commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven...

We now know that disobedience in regard to matters we may think are trifling, will effect our Millennial POSITION. But there is nothing in this verse about what happens to Christians who willfully break the GREAT AND WEIGHTIER commandments. Even the lost Pharisees kept the LESSER commandments. They did not keep the WEIGHTIER commandments:

Matthew 23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the WEIGHTIER MATTERS of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: THESE OUGHT YE TO HAVE DONE, AND NOT TO LEAVE THE OTHER UNDONE.

Matthew 22:36 Master, which is the GREAT commandment in the law?

Mark 12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other COMMANDMENT GREATER than these.

Certainly, then, our Lord would begin His teachings to HIS OWN DISCIPLES by teaching them to GO BEYOND the LESSER commandments the Pharisees obeyed, and SEEK to obey the lesser AND greater commandments through His power:

John 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

Matthew 6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33 But SEEK YE FIRST the kingdom of God, AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

They were already believers in the Lord. They were already children of their Heavenly Father. They were commanded to seek the Kingdom (i.e. the Millennial reign, see Revelation 20:4-6), and the Lord's righteousness. Every believer present already possessed the imputed, positional righteousness of Christ. They were clean in this sense:

John 13:10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but IS CLEAN EVERY WHIT: and ye are clean, but not all.

But the Lord taught His disciples to obey Him, and EXCEED the trifling righteousness of the Pharisees IN THEIR CHRISTIAN WALK. They must seek and strive to obey the great and weighty commandments, such as loving their neighbors as themselves:

Matthew 5:44 But I say unto you, LOVE your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;

Therefore, if believers break the LESSER commandments of the Lord, they will forfeit POSITION in the Kingdom. But if they do not seek to obey the GREAT commandments (thereby exceeding the trifling righteousness of the Pharisees), they will not ENTER the Kingdom:

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Herb Evans writes:

"By teaching the heresy that he does, Joey Faust, if he makes it to the kingdom, will no doubt end up as the least in that kingdom. So, it can be seen here that the differentiation amongst Christians is position rather than entrance versus any exclusion."

The differentiation amongst Christians is indeed "position" in regard to Matthew 5:19 and the LEAST of the commandments. But in regard to Matthew 5:20 and the GREAT commandments, the issue is EXCLUSION. Search the lists of sins that will exclude people from the Kingdom in Galatians 5, Ephesians 5, or 1 Corinthians 6. No one is excluded for breaking lesser commands. Paul, as our Lord in Matthew 5:20, warns believers against these sins:

Galatians 5:20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

The Pharisees were filled with hatred, murder, envy, wrath, etc. (Matthew 15:10, 23:28).

Herb Evans writes:

"That the TRIAL of your faith IS PRECIOUS, being much more precious than GOLD that persisheth, though it BE TRIED WITH FIRE, might be found UNTO PRAISE and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. -1 Peter 1:7"

Herb Evans should have capitalized the word MIGHT in this verse. The faith of every Christian will not be found "unto praise" at the Judgment Seat:

1 John 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and NOT BE ASHAMED before him at his coming.

The fact that the trying of faith by trials is likened unto gold tried by fire does not contradict the literal fire of God (like that which burned Sodom). Universalists and other no-Hellers appeal to the same proof texts Mr. Evans is attempting to comfort himself with (see Dean Farrar, etc.).

Herb Evans writes:

"Yet if a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. For the time is come that JUDGMENT must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God. And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear? - 1 Peter 4:16-18 - Joey Faust, spiritual arsonist, apostle of uncertainty, sees a fire in everything; he has never met a fire that he does not like. It is time for Joey to learn something about Fiery Fires and judgment that do not involve carnality or sin or punishment. What we have here is FIERY JUDGMENT that has nothing to do with carnality or sin or punishment of the believer. Only two camps here - the lost and the righteous. No distinctions are made between the carnal and the non carnal. These are righteous folks going through a FIERY TRIAL."

Notice that Herb Evans has apparently linked the Scripture in 1 Peter 1:7 (about a believer's responsibility to endure FIERY trials) with the JUDGMENT of 1 Peter 4:16-18. Herb obviously misses the point that the fiery trials of 1 Peter 1:7 are IN THIS LIFE, and the agent is man (thus persecutions of believers, etc.). The "judgment" of 1 Peter 4 is by God Himself, and it is at the Judgment Seat of Christ. I suppose Mr. Evans is trying to argue that since he has found a figurative fire IN THE PRESENT LIFE of believers, he has somehow disposed of any literal fire or threat at the Judgment Seat of Christ. He forgets that the Lord's throne (at the Second Coming) has LITERAL FIRE coming out of it:

Daniel 7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

Will Herb Evans argue here that the BEAST (obviously an unbeliever) does not experience a literal BURNING FLAME since unbelievers also experience FIGURATIVE FIRES in this present age?:

Psalms 57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are SET ON FIRE, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

Proverbs 16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning FIRE.

Proverbs 26:21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to FIRE; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.

No; figurative fires never do away with literal fires:

Mark 9:38 And JOHN answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not US: and WE forbad him, because he followeth not US.
39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
40 For he that is not against US is on our part.
41 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because YE BELONG TO CHRIST, verily I say unto YOU, he shall not lose his reward.
42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
43 And if THY hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into THE FIRE that never shall be quenched:
47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the

KINGDOM of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell FIRE:

The "fire" of Mark 9:47 is no more figurative than the "kingdom" of the same verse. The kingdom is literal; so is the fire. But everyone comes up out of this "hell" after the Millennium to stand at the Great White Throne:

Revelation 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and HELL delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

Notice, the lost go into the Lake of Fire for eternity, and the believers enter eternity with God (see 20:15; 21:1-6).

Herb Evans writes:

"...This FIERY trial is called a judgment of the righteous, which begins with them - not the carnal, and is rewarded accordingly. Even the righteous are said to be scarcely saved."

Again, the FIERY TRIAL of 1 Peter 1:7 is IN THIS LIFE:

1 Peter 1:6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, THOUGH NOW for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:

At the appearing of Jesus Christ all of our works will be judged, and the Lord will prove whether or not we responded to fiery trials WITH FAITH, or with bitterness, sin, and unbelief, etc.

Herb Evans writes:

"Now, Joey Faust's RULE is that if it can happen on earth, it can happen at the JSOC."

Mr. Evans knows that I have only stated that if a scourging in this life does not mitigate against the Gospel, then neither will a scourging at the Judgment Seat mitigate against it. He knows I have never stated the reckless principle he accuses me of. For example, Christians can CONFESS their sins here and get mercy. But Christians cannot confess their sins at the Judgment Seat. It will be too late. The day of mercy and patience will have ended. Yet, I have certainly stated numerous times that if God can slay Christians now, in the TIME OF HIS PATIENCE, he can slay them at the Judgment Seat of Christ, in the day of RECKONING and REWARD ACCORDING TO WORKS:

2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
11 Knowing therefore THE TERROR OF THE LORD, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

Herb Evans writes:

"Is Continuous Eternal Life Conditional upon Forsaking Things? 'And EVERYONE that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and SHALL INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE. - Matthew 19:29 - Since Joey Faust loves to adapt certain instructions and promises in the word of God to conditions for continuous eternal life, we thought it appropriate for Joey to adapt just one more conditional passage (above) to his scheme..."

Notice Mr. Evans does not interpret the passage. This is perhaps why he has resisted a formal debate. He may pick and choose his subjects, and can take them only so far as he wishes. The "eternal life" in the passage begins IN THE MILLENNIUM or world to come:

Mark 10:30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and IN THE WORLD TO COME eternal life.

But many believers will not inherit the world to come. They will not rule and reign with Christ. They will not EXPERIENCE and TASTE of this eternal life until AFTER the world to come. Thus, at the Great White Throne they will be restored, and every tear shall be wiped away:

Revelation 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

In regard to our Lord's statement there have been MANY saints who have been placed in such a trial that they had to decide whether they would DENY THE LORD or KEEP their land, home or fellowship with a family member. Although we are not able to follow the Lord, in Israel, in the first century, we must certainly obey Him in the present. And those who do not compromise when placed into situations where they must make a choice between obedience to the Lord's commandments and will, or sweet fellowship with family, etc., will be rewarded with life in the coming Millennium:

2 Timothy 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:

May the Lord stir us onward in racing for the reward of the inheritance!

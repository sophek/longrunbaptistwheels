THE BIBLE'S SCIENTIFIC FOREKNOWLEDGE (Part 5)
***************************************************

We are now making our way past three dozen examples of the Bible's
scientific foreknowledge! We are not impressed by the scoffing ignorance
of unbelievers and infidel liberals who will downplay the significance of
these remarkable examples. After their mockery, we simply give them the
floor, and ask them to present us with any other book in history which can
provide us with as great a number of amazing foresights. If these wonders
are not evidence of inspiration, then we should find many other examples
in history of such far-reaching foreknowledge. However, there is no other
book which can equal these examples in degree or number. The Bible stands
alone among all religious or philosophical works in history:

Isaiah 42:9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

Some very recent news reports confirm some of the previous examples of
scientific foreknowledge we have examined:

=====================
GENETIC CODE
=====================
Psalms 139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned,
when as yet there was none of them.

"Researchers find logic machines in biology - It almost sounds too
fantastic to be true, but a growing amount of research supports the idea
that DNA, the basic building block of life, could also be the basis of a
staggeringly powerful new generation of computers." (AP, August 18, 2003)

=======================================
SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
=======================================
Psalms 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
HEAVENS are the work of thy hands.
26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall WAX
OLD LIKE A GARMENT; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
changed:

"Fading stars 'spell the end of the universe' The universe is SLOWLY
FADING OUT, according to a new study of 40,000 galaxies....The results
show that the cosmos is gradually getting dimmer, and in time no stars
will be left shining....Professor Alan Heavens, from Edinburgh
University's Institute for Astronomy, who helped carry out the study,
said: 'Our analysis confirms that the age of star formation is drawing to
a close....The astronomers carried out a highly detailed spectral analysis
to work out the universe's star formation history. Their findings will
appear in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society..."

Let us now continue with more examples of scientific foreknowledge from
the Holy Bible:

========================================
30. MAN'S BODY IS MADE OUT OF DUST
========================================
Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the DUST of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

Genesis 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for DUST thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.

Job 4:17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure
than his maker?
18 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with
folly:
19 How much less in them that dwell in houses of CLAY, whose foundation is
in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

Job 33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am
formed out of the CLAY.

Ecclesiastes 12:7 Then shall the DUST return to the earth as it was: and
the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

This truth of the Bible was also known by scientists in earlier days:

"'The greatest miracle of the Bible,' says Dr. E. E. Slosson, a chemist of
international fame, 'is its chemical accuracy. The first book of the Bible
says man was made out of the dust. In dust there are 14 different chemical
elements, and in the body of man there are those same 14 elements." ("Dawn
Magazine," September 15, 1931)

And additional scientific knowledge only confirms this same truth:

"For many years scientists laughed at the apparent simplicity of the
scriptural account that God used the 'dust of the ground' to construct the
complex elements and molecules that make up a human being. However, after
a century of scientific examination of the elements within the human body,
scientists have been startled to discover that clay and earth contain
every single element found in the human body. A 'Reader's Digest' article
in November 1982, described a fascinating discovery by the researchers at
NASA's AMES Research Center which confirmed the Bible's account that every
single element found in the human body exists within the soil. The
scientists concluded, 'We are just beginning to learn. The biblical
scenario for the creation of life turns out to be not far off the mark.'"
(Jeffrey, "The Signature of God," 2002)

=================================
31. ANT WORKERS ARE FEMALE
=================================
Proverbs 6:6 Go to the ANT, thou SLUGGARD; consider HER ways, and be wise:
7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
8 Provideth HER meat in the summer, and gathereth HER food in the harvest.
9 How long wilt thou SLEEP, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy
SLEEP?
10 Yet a little SLEEP, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
sleep:

Modern science, armed with microscopes, is able to confirm that worker
ants in a colony are FEMALE:

"Ants are of three classes: queens, males, and WORKERS, the last being
neuters or sterile FEMALES." (Grolier Encyclopedia)

Also, many claim that ants do not sleep! And not sleeping is the context
of the passage. If ants DO sleep, scientists have not yet been able to
discover how and when.

==================================
32. LIFE OF FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD
==================================
Genesis 9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, WHICH IS THE BLOOD thereof,
shall ye not eat.

Leviticus 17:11 For the life of the flesh is IN THE BLOOD...

There is no salvation without the Blood of Jesus. But there is also a
physical truth in these Scriptures. We now know that blood carries oxygen
throughout the body, maintains bodily temperature, waters and nourishes
the cells, and removes waste. But our first U.S. president was bled to
death due to ignorance concerning these facts.

"That the blood actually possesses a living principle, and that the life
of the whole body is derived from it, is a doctrine of revelation, and a
doctrine which the experiments of the most accurate anatomists have served
strongly to confirm.Â  The proper circulation of thisÂ  important fluid
through the whole human system was first taught by Solomon in figurative
language, (Ec 12:6,) and discovered, as it is called, and demonstrated by
Dr. Harvey [1578-1657] in 1628; though some Italian philosophers had the
same notion a little before. This accurate anatomist was the first who
fully revived the Mosaic notion of the vitality of the blood...."
("Treasury of Scripture Knowledge")

"It is the fountain of life, the first to live and the last to die: the
primary seat of the animal soul: it lives and is nourished of itself and
by no other part of the human body." (William Harvey)

Solomon described the circulation of blood in a figurative sense:

Ecclesiastes 12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or THE WHEEL BROKEN AT
THE CISTERN.

"...the circulation of the blood, supposed to be first found out by a
countryman of ours in the last century, was known by Solomon, and is
thought to be designed by him in Ecclesiastes 12:6..." (John Gill's
Exposition of the Bible)

"It has been often remarked that the circulation of the blood, which has
been deemed a modern discovery by our countryman Dr. Harvey, in 1616, was
known to Solomon....the fountains, cisterns, pitcher and wheel, giving
sufficient countenance to the conclusion."
(Clarke's Commentary)

"'Or ever the silver cord [the spinal column] be loosed, or the golden
bowl [the skull] be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or
the wheel be broken in the cistern' (Eccl. 12:6). The lungs take in and
pour out air as a pitcher does water. The heart is 'the wheel' on which
the pitcher is brought up from the cistern: one of its lobes receives
blood from the veins, the other lobe casts it out again, pulsing it
through the arteries. Therein THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD was
figuratively described long before Harvey discovered it!"
(Pink, "The Doctrine of Revelation")

=========================
33. LAWS OF HYGIENE
=========================
Leviticus 15:4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is
unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.
5 And whosoever TOUCHETH his bed shall WASH HIS CLOTHES, and BATHE himself
in water, and be unclean until the even.
8 And if he that hath the issue SPIT upon him that is clean; then he shall
WASH his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.
12 And the VESSEL of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall
be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be RINSED in water.
13 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall
number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and
bathe his flesh in RUNNING WATER, and shall be clean.

Leviticus 6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be
broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and
RINSED in water.

Leviticus 11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their CARCASE
falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.

Numbers 19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
unclean.
16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open
fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean
seven days.
17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt
heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in
a vessel:
18 And a clean person shall take HYSSOP, and dip it in the water, and
sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons
that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one
dead, or a grave:
19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day,
and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself,
and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at
even.

These examples of hygiene are amazing in light of the fact that the
existence of germs was unknown until the 19th century:

"In 1847, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweiss instituted rules in his ward that
physicians must wash between patients. He was convinced that the
infections were being spread by the doctors and that the reasons midwives
had better outcomes was directly related to their practices of
cleanliness. This practice dramatically decreased the incidence of
childbed fever, but most of his contemporaries ridiculed his research and
continued to practice as they always had."

===========================
34. LAWS OF SANITATION
===========================
Deuteronomy 23:12 Thou shalt have a place also WITHOUT THE CAMP, [outside]
whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
13 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when
thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn
back and COVER that which cometh from thee:

Leviticus 4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his
head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,
12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth WITHOUT THE CAMP unto a
clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and BURN HIM on the wood with
fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

"It is generally accepted that the 'golden age of microbiology' came about
in 1876 when Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur showed that contagion could
pass from one individual to another. Their discoveries however, were
ignored and even scornfully rejected by virtually the entire medical
establishment." (David A. Wise, <a href="http://www.creationmoments.com">www.creationmoments.com</a>)

========================================
35. THE SUN IS MOVING THROUGH SPACE
========================================
Psalms 19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle FOR THE SUN,
5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a
strong man to run a race.
6 His going forth is from THE END of the heaven, and HIS CIRCUIT unto the
ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

It has only been in recent times that most MODERN scientists have found
that the sun is indeed moving through space in an orbit:

"Since early 1992, Ulysses has been monitoring the stream of stardust
flowing through our Solar System. The stardust is embedded in the local
galactic cloud through which the SUN IS MOVING at a speed of 26 kilometres
every second." (astronomynow.com, "Ulysses spacecraft sees galactic dust
on the rise," August 10, 2003)

"The movement of the sun seems NO MORE to be disputed among
astrophysicists..." (<a href="http://www.sunorbit.net/">http://www.sunorbit.net/</a>)

"Does the Sun move around the Milky Way?....The Sun does revolve around
the Milky Way on an almost circular orbit with a speed of about 220km/s.
The Sun completes one revolution in about 230 million years."
(curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=96)

=================================
36. CIRCUMCISION ON THE 8TH DAY
=================================
Genesis 17:12 And he that is EIGHT DAYS OLD shall be CIRCUMCISED among
you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or
bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

Doctors now know that on the eighth day there is more Vitamin K, which
means less bleeding and better healing. The clotting mechanism is immature
before the eighth day. Also, the eighth day is the only day that
pro-thrombin (which aids in blood clotting) is above 100%.

===========================================
37. HERBS AND VEGETABLES ARE NUTRITIOUS
===========================================
Psalms 104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and HERB for
THE SERVICE of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

James Lind, in 1700's, discovered Vitamin C. And modern scientists have
discovered many vitamins and micro-nutrients in herbs and vegetables which
nourish the body and build up the immune system.

================================
38. MODERN TRANSPORTATION
================================
Daniel 12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even
to the time of the end: MANY shall RUN to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.

If "many" shall "run" to AND fro, then it follows that transportation must
be faster. Isaac Newton wrote concerning these words:

"Personally, I cannot but believe these words [in Daniel 12] concerning
the end of the times. One sign of the end will be a remarkable increase in
methods of getting about. Men will travel from country to country in an
unprecedented manner. There may be some inventions which will enable
people to travel much more quickly than they do now." (Isaac Newton,
1642-1727)

Newton speculated from this prophecy that man might one day be able to
travel over 50 miles an hour. Voltaire, the French infidel, responded:

"See what a fool Christianity makes of an otherwise brilliant man! Here a
scientist like Newton actually writes that men may travel at the rate of
30 or 40 miles per hour. Has he forgotten that if man would travel at this
rate he would be suffocated? His heart would stand still!"

And thus we see that all who mock God's wisdom will end up mocked by
wisdom (Proverbs 1:26, 1 Corinthians 1:20):

"During the late 1890's, most people in North America and Europe lived in
rural areas and had little contact with people more than 20 miles (32
kilometers) or so away. Many of these people were farmers or residents of
small towns that served farmers. In the early 1900's, they became the
first mass group of car buyers. Automobiles enabled farmers to sell their
goods faster and farther away, and to travel more often and in greater
comfort than ever before. "(<a href="http://www.adtsea.iup.edu/vadets/TheAutomobile.htm">www.adtsea.iup.edu/vadets/TheAutomobile.htm</a>)

There is another passage of Scripture which appears to describe our modern
cars, or some future electric or solar car:

Nahum 2:3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in
scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his
preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against
another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall RUN
LIKE THE LIGHTNINGS.

"Millenniums before Henry Ford was born, Nahum. (2:4) foretold, 'The
chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another
in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the
lightnings'!"
(Pink, "The Doctrine of Revelation")

==========================================
39. THE MOON INFLUENCES LIFE ON EARTH
===========================================
Deuteronomy 33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land,
for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that
coucheth beneath,
14 And for the precious FRUITS brought forth by the sun, and for the
PRECIOUS THINGS PUT FORTH BY THE MOON,

Scientists claim that there would be no life on Earth, beyond the
microbial, without the moon. Notice these testimonies from scientists:

"The Moon is believed to play an important role in Earth's habitability.
Because the Moon helps stabilize the tilt of the Earth's rotation, it
prevents the Earth from wobbling between climatic extremes. Without the
Moon, seasonal shifts would likely outpace even the most adaptable forms
of life." (<a href="http://www.astrobio.net/news/article178.html">www.astrobio.net/news/article178.html</a>, "Making the Moon")

"You probably know that the Moon's gravity creates tides on Earth by
attracting the water of the ocean....With the Moon, the axis wobbles a
little bit but generally stays put....The Moon is good for a whole lot
more than simply lighting up the night sky. If you wonder what your life
would be like without it, the surprising answer is that you wouldn't be
here to wonder at all!" (drfred.hispeed.com/askmoon.htm)

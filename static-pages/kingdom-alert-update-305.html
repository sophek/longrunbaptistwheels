UPCOMING CONFERENCE IN NEW JERSEY!: 
Pastor Gordon Parks is planning the C.O.O.K.S. Conference ("Conference of Overcoming Kingdom Saints") for September of this year. It will be held in his church, in New Jersey. I will be preaching, along with some other pastors. I will have more details to come. Please pray for their upcoming meeting, and plan on attending if you can.
 
KINGDOM, ACCOUNTABILITY TRUTH ABOUNDING:
Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
"[Christians are] slowly waking to the immense importance of responsibility truth. It is tragic how many evangelicals abhor responsibility truth." (D.M. Panton, 1947)

One of the latest books to properly divide between eternal salvation and reward, and begin to rightfully apply the warnings to believers, is The Kingdom, Power & Glory: The Overcomer's Handbook, by Nancy Missler (http://www.kingshighway.org/) 

Chuck Missler writes:
"After being Christians for over 50 years, we consider the truths in this book to be some of the most life-changing principles we have encountered since our new birth."

The book attempts to answer, among other things:

"What is the difference between the "narrow road" and the "wide gate" for Christians?

"What are the consequences for the carnal Christian in this kingdom?"

The strength of this book is its proper division between positional and practical salvation (imputed and infused righteousness, etc.). And likewise, the fact that it applies the warnings to believers to true believers, while avoiding the Reformed and Arminian errors. One weakness of the book is that it spiritualizes these warnings in a way that removes much of their force. One revealed law of interpretation is that every dream, vision, parable, etc. is always literal in its main warning or event (Matthew 13:30,42, Judges 9:15, 49). Furthermore, once the believer's warnings are spiritualized, what then becomes of the warnings to the unbeliever? And lastly, some of the warnings to believers promise some of the same consequences pronounced on the unbeliever (Luke 12:46, Ephesians 5:6,7, Revelation 18:4, 22:18, etc.). Even so, this book is an example of a growing body of believers who are repairing the breeches in the foundational fear of the Lord, and returning to the Biblical understanding of the Apostles (Philippians 3:11), and the early Christians in the first three centuries. Tertullian writes that early Christians prayed to have part in the first resurrection and were willing to die excruciating deaths in order to win it.

GET THE BOOK: GOD BETRAYED: Separation of Church and State: The Biblical Principles and the American Application, by Jerald Finney.
I hope to write a more extensive review of this excellent book; I am reading it through for a second time, as time permits. It is over 400 pages, small print. Brother Finney is a Christian attorney. There are many so-called Christian historians who are covering over the true Baptist history and defense of religious liberty, in order to paint the Puritans, etc. in a better light, and provide historical support for modern Dominion theology, etc. Brother Finney does a fine job documenting the true history, etc.

SALVATION: NO ROOM FOR BOASTING!

 (By Joey Faust, Salvation Sermon, Ephesians 2, June 22-08)
 
TEXT: Ephesians 2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
 
It is not God's will that we walk like lost people, the way we did before we were saved. I thought about just staying on the first three verses of Ephesians 2 until Jesus returned. But I am finally going to move forward. But if you do anything to set me off again, I am just itching for an excuse to get back to them! It is what all believers need to be reminded of in these last days!
 
But let us look at the next section. It reminds the Ephesian saints (and us) that they were saved by God's grace!
 
Let's look at this closer: "But God." That is where it starts! We were something different. "But God!" That is how you ended up saved! How did you get saved?: GOD! If you answer your own works of righteousness, you have missed the boat!:
 
Romans 10:3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
 
What is the next phrase?: "rich in mercy." It does not say rich in judgment or rich in evaluation. These things are also true about God. But if all God had was justice, we would be in a fix!

Eternal salvation is given us through God's mercy! So far it is not leaving us any room for boasting! We have God. And then we have God's mercy!
 
How were you saved? If you  can't answer God, then you have the wrong answer. And then, if you want to get more specific, we were saved by God showing us mercy! Mercy is something that is shown to people in poverty; or affliction, or those convicted of crimes. When we receive mercy, there is nothing to be proud of! The only reasonable response to mercy is gratitude!
 
Are you getting the picture that eternal salvation is not of our own works? Let's keep going:
 
"for his great love wherewith he loved us..."
 
I believe it was Andrew Murray who reminded us that if we had never sinned, like some angels, we would still have grounds to cover our faces in humility! That is covered in the phrase "But God." We are created beings, and there is no room for boasting. But we are not only created beings; we are also creatures who have sinned against God. Therefore, we must have mercy, or we will be forever damned in shame and fire. 
 
Notice that word "for." Why was God merciful? Maybe we can find a place for a little boasting?
 
Didn't Robert Schuller, and all his psychological, humanistic friends, tell us that the REASON, God showed us mercy, through the Cross, was so we can see it as a ground for self-pride?:
 
"And he bore the cross to sanctify your self-esteem. And the cross will sanctify the ego trip!"
(Schuller, Living Positively One Day at a Time)
 
"I believe that the responsibility in this Age is to 'positivize' religion. Now this probably doesn't have much bearing to you people, being Unity people, you're positive. But I talk a great deal to groups that are not positive... even to what we would call Fundamentalists who deal constantly with words like sin, salvation, repentance, guilt, that sort of thing...So when I'm dealing with these people. . .what we have to do is
positivize the words that have classically only had a negative interpretation." 
(Schuller, address at Unity Village, Unity tape)

Notice, he admits that they use fundamental Christian language, but change the meanings like all good cultists!
 
"I may not deserve it [eternal salvation], but I am worth it; so don't say that I am unworthy."
(Schuller, Self-Esteem)

These humanistic, new-age Masons, masquerading as Christians, agree that we have received God's mercy. But they twist this into an excuse for so-called healthy boasting by saying that the reason God showed us mercy was due to how worthy we are!
 
But let us hear the Scriptures! Ephesians 2:4 says that God showed mercy FOR "his great love wherewith he loved us."
 
"For" = "because of." Why did God show mercy to us sinners? Because He loved us! Because of His great love toward us!:
 
1 John 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
 
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
 
The proper response to God's love is gratitude, not pride:
 
1. God saved us. 
2. God saved us through His mercy. 
3. God was merciful because He loved us.
 
Now the next question: Did God love us because we merited His love? Did we clean ourselves up or obey His law in such an impressive manner, that it moved God to love us? Is God impressed with lost humanity?:
 
Job 15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
 
But we don't have to look in the OT. This truth is right before our eyes in the text:
 
5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
 
1. God saved us. 
2. God saved us through His mercy. 
3. God was merciful because He loved us.
4. He loved us when we were dead in sin, eternally condemned!
 
 Now let's read the rest of this section!:
 
5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
 
Notice, this is all of God, and nothing of ourselves. Salvation is by GRACE. 
 
Grace is opposed to merit or works:
 
Grace: "Appropriately, the free unmerited love and favor of God." (Web., 1828)
 
It is, by its very definition, unmerited, and free (v.8, a gift!). If we could merit this love it would not be grace! Salvation is not of works, or merit, or worthiness. It is by grace!:
 
Romans 11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
 
Romans 4:2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.
3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
 
What kind of man is quickened and saved? A man dead in sins. What kind of man gets justified? An ungodly man. You believe in Jesus as a sinner, or you miss the boat:
 
Not the labors of my hands 
can fulfill thy law's commands; 
could my zeal no respite [ceasing] know, 
could my tears forever flow, 
all for sin could not atone; 
thou must save, and thou alone.
 
Nothing in my hand I bring, 
simply to the cross I cling; 
naked, come to thee for dress; 
helpless, look to thee for grace; 
foul, I to the fountain fly; 
wash me, Savior, or I die. 
(Rock of Ages)
 
 
What is God going to show for eternal ages? He will show the glories of His mercy; His kindness; His grace! (2:7):
 
Ephesians 1:6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
 
Now don't miss the legal basis by which God can show us grace! (1:7):
 
Ephesians 2:7...riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
The death of Jesus; His Blood, is the legal basis by which God can show us mercy:
 
Psalms 85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
 
How can mercy and truth meet together? The truth about us is that we are sinners:
 
Romans 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight...
 
That is the truth. That is justice. But God is also rich in mercy! But mercy and truth are miles apart. They cannot meet. They can find no ground. The law demands, "Kill the sinners for all eternity!" 
 
The righteousness of the law demands it! God desires propitiation. He desires peace. But righteousness and peace are at enmity! They are in opposition. There is conflict. God must kill and judge; but He desires peace and mercy for us. What can solve the conflict?
God must be just, but His mercy desires to be the justifier of sinners:
 
Isaiah 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
 
Now God can be just! The demands of the law have been met. Jesus was made a curse for us!:
 
Romans 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,
26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
 
But this simple Gospel has been for centuries despised; first by unbelievers who go about to establish their own righteousness; and secondly, believers, who have been puffed up with pride, and have forgotten their own mercy, and the simplicity of the Gospel they once believed. But it is a danger that Jesus warned about in Matthew 18. We can receive mercy, and then go preach justice to others.
 
Recently, the simple Gospel I preach has been maligned. On one side, we have folks teaching that I pervert the "Gospel" because I teach that God rules His household, and has consequences for disobeying its rules. These consequences are not eternal. He has set up a special age of reward for the purpose of rewarding His Son and those who suffer with and obey their Lord. Yet, on the other side, I am ridiculed as being an "easy believer" who makes the Gospel too free! I am accused of teaching too much GRACE! Notice:
 
 "This point of view is associated...particularly [with] the writings of Robert Wilkin, Zane Hodges, Joseph Dillow, and J.D. Faust...the basic problem in the views of Wilkin, Hodges, Dillow, and Faust is that they compensate for a deficient view of saving faith by teaching severe punishment for the 'believer' at the Judgment Seat of Christ and beyond."
(Myron J. Houghton, Ph.D., Th.D., Faith Pulpit (March/April 2008), Faith Baptist Theological Seminary: A Critique of "Easy Believism")
 
I am guilty of teaching "easy believism," and I wear the label as an honor. But it was not easy for my Lord. And I do not teach that someone should just repeat a prayer without a thorough Gospel presentation (especially some vague one, without the Gospel). However, I have seen God use such simplicity, in spite of its vagueness, and save people mightily. Yet, while I teach that salvation is a free gift through faith alone, no one should accuse me of irresponsibility in standards. I teach you should eat healthy since the body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. I teach that women should be modest, according to God's view of nakedness. I do not think many could listen to my sermons and say that I am somehow irresponsible. Folks cannot make up their minds whether I am a legalist or an easy-believism preacher standing for free-grace. The truth is, I believe that eternal salvation is free through faith alone. Yet, after salvation, believers should live holy. They should be warned and encouraged to holiness. They should be told the truth concerning the Judgment Seat of Christ and kingdom exclusion. 
 
And, for those who think that "easy believism" is a new doctrine, I will remind you that Spurgeon, before death, uttered that he was not trusting in his fruits, or his works, but in nothing but the Blood of Jesus. Spurgeon, on his good days, taught SIMPLE BELIEVISM and EASY BELIEVISM:
 
"...a knowledge of the truth teaches us that faith is the simple act of trusting, that it is not an action of which man may boast; it is not an action of the nature of a work, so as to be a fruit of the law; but faith is a self-denying grace which finds all its strength in him upon whom it lives, and lays all its honor upon him...Faith is not self in action but self forsaken, self abhorred, self put away that the soul may trust in Christ, and trust in Christ alone...I suppose that it is a very hard thing to understand because it is so plain. When a man wishes the way of salvation to be difficult he naturally kicks at it because it is easy; and, when his pride wants it to be hard to be understood, he is pretty sure to say that he does not understand it because it is so plain. Do not you know that the unlettered often receive Christ when philosophers refuse him, and that he who has not called many of the great, and many of the mighty, has chosen poor, foolish, and despised things? That is because poor foolish men, you know, are willing to believe a plain thing, but men wise in their own conceits desire to be, if they can, a little confounded and puzzled that they may please themselves with the idea that their own superior intellect has made a discovery; and, because the way of salvation is just so easy that almost an idiot boy may lay hold of it, therefore they pretend that they do not understand it...Now, it so happens that the way of salvation by faith is so simple that it seems beneath the dignity of exceedingly clever men. May God bring them to a knowledge of this truth: may they see that they cannot be saved except by giving up all idea of saving themselves; that they cannot be saved except they step right into Christ, for, until they get to the end of the creature, they will never get to the beginning of the Creator. Till they empty out their pockets of every moldy crust, and have not a crumb left; they cannot come and take the rich mercy which is stored up in Christ Jesus for every empty, needy sinner. May the Lord be pleased to give you that knowledge of the truth!"
(Spurgeon, Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, Volume 26, 1880)
 
"My hope lives not because I am not a sinner, but because I am a sinner for whom Christ died; my trust is not that I am holy, but that being unholy, He is my righteousness. My faith rests not upon what I am, or shall be, or feel, or know, but in what Christ is, in what He has done. . ."
(Spurgeon, Morning and Evening, Romans 3)
 
Works, far from being a basis for assurance, actually need to be repented of!:
 
Hebrews 6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God. . .
 
Works are only living when they are done in gratitude for the finished work of Christ!
 
This message will be continued in multiple parts, in order to answer those who object or further question this simple Gospel. There are men preparing the way for the revival or Rome and her ecumenical seductions. Already, many have declared that justification by faith alone was only a misunderstanding; it is a debate over semantics. They say that we can agree with Rome, since saving faith is really faith-works. (See J.I. Packer, who wrote the foreword to Macarthur's, The Gospel According to Jesus). When the Biblical warnings are rightly applied to believers, there is no need to adulterate the Gospel and please Rome!
 
In the second sermon of this series, we will notice not only the Bible, but the true Reformation view of faith. In the third sermon of this series, we will answer Houghton's article (Faith Pulpit), line by line.

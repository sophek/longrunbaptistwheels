        <h1>REMEMBER NOW THY CREATOR [AND HIS PLAN FOR EATING]...(BY JO WILLIAMS, MS, PHD)</h1>

            "...disease starts very quietly, without fanfare, on a cellular level [hidden away where it cannot be seen at first]. There are no flags or whistles when one cell becomes impaired, even though it is unable to function properly. There is no pain, distress, or discomfort when it dies and you are one cell older. As the process continues, you become several cells older, then many cells older. When enough cells malfunction, tissue is affected. When enough tissue has been compromised, disease is noticed. Too little, too late, as the saying goes..." (Germanium, A New Approach To Immunity, Betty Kamen, PhD, 1992, Nutrition Encounter, Inc., 1992-4)

"Those who have ears to hear" may often avoid the "slippery slope" of modern medicine's "'doping, mutilating, burning, and poisoning" (prescription drugs, multiple surgeries, irradiation and chemo) from which others never escape until death, often preceded by years of misery of one kind or another. They never recapture the level of wellness they sacrificed lusting for "the king's dainties," thinking they could get away with it.

A loved one was constantly tempted by office dainties he found irresistable and said to me, "I'll eat what you prepare when I'm home - don't ask me what I eat when I'm not here" as though he was doing me a favor to eat "Designer" foods provided by the Creator. Of course, I knew what he ate elsewhere when I saw the fasting serum glucose, lipid panel, and other diagnostic tests. Painful arthritis appeared in the finger joints and he decided it wasn't worth the pleasure enjoyed for moments at a time. Often the first sign is a fatal heart attack or "the silent killer" (sugar diabetes it used to be called) shows up suddenly one day. Actually it has been going on for years.

Most people who eat the Sad American Diet (SAD) and see no obvious adverse and immediate effects think of me, a whole-foods nutritional scientist, as an extremist and "a purist." They have been taught "If it feels good do it, if it tastes good eat it!" "It hasn't hurt me!" they may tell me when I try to help them prevent the inevitable, certain that they're getting away with dietary indiscretions their bodies are already struggling to handle if they but recognized the signs. Often these are not hidden, they've just "learned to live with it" as their medics advise.

American children, beginning as toddlers who eat French fries three times per week on average, are as obese as adults now, already show signs of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and adult onset diabetes. If only they would experience extreme pain when they picked up that first counterfeit, non-food, when they began to eat at the world's "hog trough." And though it may take some longer than others to notice the damage, it is inevitable, just a matter of time, preceded by constant colds, flu; sinus, ear, fungal, yeast and other infections; headaches, constipation, poor eye sight, tooth/gum problems, obesity, diabetes and other blood sugar dysregulation; hormonal imbalances, hypertension, gallbladder removal, "acid reflux" and indigestion, PMS and prostate problems, then on to cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and by-pass surgery, stroke, and peripheral neuropathy.

Those who quip, "We've all got to die of something!" as they quickly hog down piles of "junk food," have no clue what that long painful process will involve. I recently attended the funeral of a diabetic who lay in a nursing home for months' she was in excruciating pain while "her legs rotted off and her arms turned black" her relative told me. Medicine could do nothing. Choices may have tragic consequences. "When lust has conceived, it brings forth death..."

The Creator designed us such that when we remove that which causes illness, and provide the body what it needs, it heals itself, but that is occurring less and less today. All to often I am called only after irreversible damage has been done, medics can do no more, and quality of life can be improved only a degree if at all.

However, I have also seen even near-ninety year olds respond remarkably when they switch to a diet of fresh, whole, real foods - living foods, and take nutritional concentrates. He "satisfies thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles," Psalm 103:5 exhorts us. The world's denatured, devitalized faux-foods don't satisfy or provide nourishment vital for life, healing and restoration.They're like the potato chip ad says, "You can't eat just one." Fresh, whole foods, God's foods, especially organically home-grown fruits and veggies; organic clean meats, poultry, cold water fish, raw milk, raw dairy products, and eggs from farm-yard chickens, can provide nourishment to the body so it may revitalize and renew itself amazingly!

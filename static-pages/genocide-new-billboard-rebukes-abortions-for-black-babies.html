<strong>New York (CNN)</strong> â€” A billboard has sparked controversy in New York after an anti-abortion group erected a sign focused exclusively on African-American abortion rates.

The sign â€” which was paid for by an organization called Life Always â€” reads: â€œThe most dangerous place for an African-American is in the womb.â€

The billboard â€” located roughly a half mile from a Planned Parenthood facility in Manhattanâ€™s Soho neighborhood â€” features an African-American girlâ€¦â€</blockquote>
The Bible teaches plainly that pregnant women are â€œwith child,â€ not some inhuman fetus. Paganism has always been associated with death and murder (as Humanism), and we have certainly arrived at this state in America. Humanists planned to use public school to indoctrinate children, and their plan has worked. When will Christians wake up? The Humanists were already laughing as early as 1930., at how gullible Christians are in regard to public school. Things like abortion will continually plague America unless we awake to the destructive nature of public schooling. But Americans have become addicted to divorce, having children through fornication, and mothers working outside the home. May we repent before it tis too late.

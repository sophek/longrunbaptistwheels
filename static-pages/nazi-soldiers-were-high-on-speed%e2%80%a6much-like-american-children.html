            <blockquote>â€œ<strong>HITLERâ€™S propaganda stressed the importance of keeping fit but in reality his soldiers were taking drugs. </strong>The troops were taking addictive and damaging chemicals to make them fight longer and more fiercelyâ€¦

The German armyâ€™s drug of choice as it overran Poland, Holland, Belgium and France was Pervitin â€“ pills made of methamphetamine, known today as crystal meth.

Thousands of Nazi soldiers were using the drug by the time the Soviet Union was invaded in 1941.Â About 200 million Pervitin pills were given to Nazi troops between 1939 and 1945, research by the German Doctorsâ€™ Association revealedâ€¦â€Â

It seems the NAZIâ€™S are still among us, in this Brave New World that dopes up millions of school children with Ritalin, etc. This enriches the drug companies, and it also keeps children â€œfocusedâ€ (like any cocaine addict who can play darts, etc. for hours). Once the paddle had been removed from schools, the feminists were faced with a problem. What do they do about the obvious misbehavior now that children have never learned to control themselves? These lunatics call paddling â€œchild abuse,â€ yet they see drugging millions of elementary children with forms of speed as â€œenlightenmentâ€ and progress! With abortion (inherited from Margaret Sanger, the friend of the Naziâ€™s), and the drugging, and the mass propaganda, we see that many of the principles of the Nazi world-view are alive and well in Humanists, Liberals, and Feminists. They try to paint conservatives as Naziâ€™s to draw attention away from their own guilt.

        <h1>AN OBJECTION BY JESSE SNG ON 1 THESSALONIANS 3:13</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote>I was just reading this today: "To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ  with all his saints." 1 Thessalonians 3:13, KJV. The "ALL" here is interesting - that means none of the saints are excluded. I guess that means that Faust has to argue that the coming and revelation of our Lord at the start of the Millenial Kingdom covers all saints, but not after. So by his reasoning, Christ comes in Victory with all the saints, including the carnal ones but then decides to pick on everyone after that battle's won and bars some of the victorious from the Kingdom?"  -Jesse Sng</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Faust's Answer:
</strong></p>
The above Scripture has been isolated by Jesse Sng. But the whole context of this Scripture is revealing:
<blockquote><em><strong>1 Thessalonians 3:1 </strong></em>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; 2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, TO ESTABLISH YOU, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 3 That NO MAN SHOULD BE MOVED by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. 5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, AND OUR LABOUR BE IN VAIN. 12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: 13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</blockquote>
It is clear that verse 13 is a PRAYER (or a heart's desire) of Paul for these saints. These saints will be stablished UNBLAMEABLE in the end, at the coming of Christ (i.e. when the Judgment Seat of Christ occurs), only IF they continue to fulfill the conditions of verse 12, and also are not "moved" (verse 3) by the "tempter" (v.5). This prayer/desire of Paul in 1 Thessalonians 3:12-13 is similar to the one in chapter 5:
<blockquote><em><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:22</strong></em> Abstain from all appearance of evil.
23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I PRAY God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</blockquote>
If these saints will all be AUTOMATICALLY presented blameless at the coming of the Lord, then why did Paul PRAY for this to occur? And why was he burdened to know whether or not they had been "moved"? One cannot be "moved" from something unless he is already on it. 1 Thessalonians 3:12-13 is a prayer. However, the clear, doctrinal statement on the subject is found in Colossians 1:22:
<blockquote><em><strong>Colossians 1:22</strong></em> In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: 23 IF ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and BE NOT MOVED away from the HOPE of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</blockquote>
Colossians 1:22-23 is not a prayer or a hope. It is a doctrinal statement that reveals that the Gospel also contains a hope in regard to the coming of Christ. And it is possible for saints to be moved away from this hope, and find themselves in shame before Christ at His coming (1 John 2:28). The Lord will reward them according to their works. In regard to the phrase "all his saints," it appears that the objector sees the coming of Christ in this passage only in its final stage (to destroy Antichrist at Armageddon). He writes:
<blockquote>"Christ comes in Victory with all the saints, including the carnal ones but then decides to pick on everyone after that battle's won and bars some of the victorious from the Kingdom?"</blockquote>
Christ indeed comes with "all his saints" (i.e. the faithful and the unfaithful) to the sky above earth. However, the Judgment Seat of Christ occurs BEFORE the battle of Armageddon. At His coming, the Lord first "reckons" with all His saints. The word "victory" was added to the text by the objector. When Christ comes, all His saints will appear, when called. But all will not be found worthy to descend with Him in battle. Those that descend with Him in battle will be â€œchosenâ€ out from among the company of saints:
<blockquote><em><strong>Revelation 17:14</strong></em> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and FAITHFUL.</blockquote>
Every saint is not faithful; nor will every saint be presented faithful at the Second Coming:
<blockquote><em><strong>Revelation 2:10</strong></em> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</blockquote>
<blockquote><em><strong>1 Corinthians 4:2</strong></em> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Matthew 25:21</strong> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and FAITHFUL servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</blockquote>
<blockquote><em><strong>Luke 12:42</strong></em> And the Lord said, Who then is that FAITHFUL and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?43 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.</blockquote>
Only those servants who are found to be FAITHFUL by the Lord at His return, will descend with Him in final victory at the end of the Tribulation Period.  -Joey Faust (6-9-05)

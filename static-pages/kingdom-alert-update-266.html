TALEBEARING: FUEL FOR THE DEVIL'S DESTRUCTIVE FIRE ***************************************************************
"Slander is outright....aspersion is indirect and covert. Aspersion is accomplished by insinuating, by casting reflections, by making damaging implications, by discrediting, especially in a slighting or belittling way. To admit that a piece of work is very good, but imply at the same time that any normal person could so it as well with little effort is to cast aspersion. SCANDAL consists of gossip, perhaps true, perhaps false, repeated either from malice or thoughtlessness, and spread abroad. The fact that scandal is true takes away none of the reproach that attaches to the scandalmonger."

("Winston Simplified Dictionary," 1931)

Proverbs 26:20 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no TALEBEARER, the strife ceaseth.
21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

The Devil is working hard in these last days to destroy marriages, split families, divide churches, and sow unnecessary discord between friends and brethren (Proverbs 6:19). One of his greatest tools of destruction is the sin of talebearing. Talebearers "reveal secrets":

Proverbs 20:19 He that goeth about as a talebearer REVEALETH SECRETS: therefore MEDDLE NOT with him that flattereth with his lips.

They use flattery to pry out information that they later make public to others. Talebearers and scandalmongers are contentious people (Proverbs 26:21). For example, a husband with a contentious, talebearing wife, will soon find that his every action, his every fault (real or imagined) has been continually broadcasted to everyone that was foolish enough to provide a listening ear to his wife:

Proverbs 27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. 

There are some ointments that are so strong that the scent cannot be hidden, even if the hand is closed. In the same way, a contentious woman soon manifests her rebellion before the eyes of others. She also brazenly manifests her husband's private life, in the name of "seeking counsel." This will taint his character in the eyes of everyone who listens, even if they, at first, attempt to be impartial:

Proverbs 18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

There is almost always another side. Therefore, the words of one sister were very wise, when she said, "I avoid, as much as possible, discussing my marriage with my parents when I am angry; for they will later have a much harder time forgiving and forgetting what I have told them in the heat of emotion." Indeed, there would be less opportunity for talebearing, if there were not so many people that were more than willing to be "tale-hearers"! It is indeed a sin to be a talebearer. But it is also a sin to listen to a talebearer, scandalmonger, or slanderer reproach a person behind his or her back:

Psalms 15:1 LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
3 He that BACKBITETH NOT not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor TAKETH UP A REPROACH against his neighbour.

To "take up a reproach" is to WILLINGLY HEAR a reproach from the lips of a talebearer. As a pastor, I have often stopped people in conversation, and said, "I would not sit here and allow someone to discuss you behind your back; therefore, I will not allow you to discuss this brother (or sister)." There is a big difference between a person bringing an emergency report, in the right manner, to the right authority (see 1 Corinthians 1:11), and a person who is simply addicted to slander, talebearing, gossip, etc., and will not repent of it when reproved.

Many marriages would be saved if more parents would obey the Bible and avoid meddling in the affairs of their grown children. I know many of these affairs are brought to their doorstep by talebearing. Yet, the Bible is clear how talebearing should be treated:

Proverbs 25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.

Psalms 26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.

1 Samuel 24:9 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

"...good manners would silence the slanderer if he saw that his tales displeased the company." (Matthew Henry)

"If there were not gratified hearers of ill reports, there would be an end of the trade of spreading them. Trapp says, that 'the tale-bearer carrieth the devil in his tongue, and the tale-hearer carries the devil in his ear.' It is a sin to endure or tolerate tale-bearers.  'Show that man out!' we should say of a drunkard, yet it is very questionable if his unmanly behaviour will do us so much mischief as the tale-bearers insinuating story. 'Call for a policeman!' we say if we see a thief at his business; ought we to feel no indignation when we hear a gossip at her work?  Mad dog!  Mad dog!! is a terrible hue and cry, but there are few curs whose bite is so dangerous as a busybody's tongue. Fire! fire!! is an alarming note, but the tale-bearer's tongue is set on fire of hell, and those who indulge it had better mend their manners, or they may find that there is fire in hell for unbridled tongues." (Spurgeon)

"The saints of God must not be too light of hearing, much less of believing all tales, rumours, and reports of their brethren; and charity requireth that we do not only stop and stay them, but that we examine them before we believe them.  Saul, the king, too light of belief in this point, believed the slanderous and false reports of David's enemies, who put into Saul's head that David imagined evil against him.  Yea, David himself showed his great infirmity in that, that without due examination and proof of the matter, he believed the false report of Ziba, against Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan..."

(Richard Turnbull)

It is not only fathers and mothers that must be careful not to hear talebearing. The modern "counseling model" often requires pastors to give an ear to sinful talebearing, gossip, and slander. While it is true that pastors are called to watch for souls, and to admonish and guide the flock by the Scriptures, they must be very careful not to usurp the authority of the man in his home. They must not allow private, intimate matters to be recklessly revealed. It is wrong to be alone with the opposite sex. And it is always wrong to listen to talebearing, gossip and slander, even if you are a pastor.

Too often, husbands dump their marriages in the lap of a pastor, and say, "Fix my wife." This occurs after years of disobeying the pastor's admonitions to quit flirting with sin and justifying it, to have a regular family altar in the home, and to protect the home from evil influences. Likewise, many wives see the pastor as the person they can call after they have called the father or mother, to bad-mouth their husbands and reveal (from their viewpoint) everything their husbands need to be doing (or stop doing).

The latest issue of the "PsychoHeresy Awareness Letter" (Volume 13, Number 3), contains an excellent, insightful article on this subject. The article is titled, "Counseling Encourages Talebearing." (http://www.psychoheresy-aware.org). Here are some quotes from this great article:

"What do people talk about in counseling?....Quite often people are encouraged to talk about their parents, spouse, children, other relatives, and close friends, as well as numerous other people....the story will be told from the teller's perspective, with details chosen from the teller's memory...it often turns into a tale that places the teller in a better light than the others being talked about....if a woman complains about her husband in counseling or elsewhere, she is very possibly revealing private matters, exposing perceived or actual faults, and/or making him seem worse than he really is. That is talebearing....Talebearing harms relationships and may be one of the main reasons marriage counseling so often leads to divorce....we do not condone covering up actual serious sins that may have been committed, but those would have to be verified, not just talked about in counseling....As the counselor hears complaints, he cannot help but form an impression of the person be!

 ing complained about....when they tell their tales from their own perspective, they may get lots of sympathy and support. Yes, indeed, the flesh will feel better....'A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.' (Prov.11:13). Most offenses are small, and for these, love should cover a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:6)..."

This article is a good rebuke of the common practice of gossiping and hurting people's character under the guise of "counseling":

MRS. CONTENTIOUS B. TALEBEARING: "I do not desire to gossip, and I don't wish to speak evil of my brother, but I do need some COUNSEL about a situation"

MRS. MEDDLE B. TALE-HEARING: "Oh, of course! I am an aged woman, and you know the Bible says that the aged women need to help the younger wives. So, sit right down; I'll get us some snacks, and you can tell me all about that miserable scoundrel you have for a husband! I knew something was wrong when I first laid eyes on him."

No parent, no pastor, no brother or sister, or friend, should allow a person to criticize, complain about, slander, malign, ridicule, expose intimate details, or despise another person in their presence. Such tale-hearing is not Biblical love; it is worldly love.

Our churches need continual instruction on the sins of backbiting and slander. The Devil's destroying fires must be put out before more homes and churches are wrecked. The following reproofs from the Bible, and dictionary definitions, may be helpful to those who are willing to forsake these commonly justified sins:

SLANDER:
 
"A false tale or report maliciously uttered, and tending to injure the reputation of another by lessening him in the esteem of his fellow citizens." (Webster's 1828)

"To bring discredit upon; disgrace." (Funk & Wagnall's Standard Dict. 1895)

"To bring into disgrace, discredit, or disrepute." (Oxford Dict.)

"The principle kinds of slander are these:
1. charging others with faults they are not guilty of;
2. affixing scandalous names and odious characters which they deserve not;
3. aspersing a man's actions with foul names, importing that they proceed from evil principles, or tend to bad ends, when it does not or cannot appear;

4. perverting a man's words or acts disadvantageously by affected misconstruction;
5. partial or lame representation of men's discourse or practice, suppressing some part of the truth or concealing some circumstances which ought to be explained;

6. instilling sly suggestions which create prejudice in the hearers;
7. magnifying and aggravating the faults of others..."
("Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Encyclopedia," 1890)

BACKBITE:

"1. To censure, slander, reproach, or speak evil of the absent." (Webster's 1828)

"1. To detract from the character of, to slander, traduce, speak of ill of a person absent." (Oxford)

Titus 2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not FALSE ACCUSERS...

Proverbs 17:9 He that COVERETH a transgression seeketh love; but he that REPEATETH a matter separateth very friends.

1 Peter 2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all EVIL SPEAKINGS,

Ephesians 4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and EVIL SPEAKING, be put away from you, with all malice:

James 4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren...

Leviticus 19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a TALEBEARER among thy people...

20 QUESTIONS FOR KING JAMES ONLYISTS WHO OBJECT TO MILLENNIAL EXCLUSION
**********************************************************************

[Please send answers to pastor@kingdombaptist.org for inclusion on our web site]

1. In 1 Corinthians 9:27 Paul labors to keep from being a "castaway." In Luke 9, Jesus addresses His disciples (including Peter, vv.20, 23), and John and James (v.27-28), and He also warns them about the possibility of being "cast away" (v.25). Why don't you use Luke 9:25 to understand what Paul means in 1 Corinthians 9:27?

2. Did the warning in Luke 9:25 still apply to Peter, James and John when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 9:27?

3. If it did not, at what point did the warning that Jesus gave to Peter, James and John in Luke 9:25 cease to apply to them?

4. Why do you think the Devil would use the NIV to destroy the link between Luke 9:25 and 1 Corinthians 9:27 (by erasing the words castaway, cast away)?

5. In Mark 9:38, John is speaking. When the Lord answers him, who does the "thy" (second person singular) refer to in Mark 9:43?

6. Does the phrase "ye belong to Christ" in Mark 9:41 mean that John was eternally saved?

7. In verse 50, who is Jesus addressing?

8. When are unbelievers bodily resurrected for judgment?

9. Do unbelievers, according to a KJV, go to Hell after their bodily resurrection, or do they go to the Lake of Fire? (see Revelation 20:14-15)

10. Who is Jesus warning about going to "Hell" in BODY, an unbeliever or a believer (Mark 9:47)?

11. According to Jesus, to escape Hell is to enter the Kingdom of God in body (Mark 9:47). When does this Kingdom begin (see Luke 21:31)?

12. When is the Last Day, mentioned by Jesus in reference to unbelievers in John 12:48?

13. When did Jesus promise to raise up everyone who BELIEVES upon Him in John 6:40?

14. Can you believe the Gospel, yet refuse to confess Jesus, and be a faithful believer? (see John 12:42, Matthew 10:30-32, 2 Timothy 2:12)

15. Does Jesus have something more for believers who confess Him, live for Him, and suffer for Him? What is it?

16. What is the "better resurrection" that many were tortured in order to receive in Hebrews 11:35?

17. What is the "resurrection" that Paul suffered for, and for which he allowed himself to be made conformable to Christ's death in order to attain in Philippians 3:10-11?

18. Is the Last Day the same as the Seventh Day in Hebrews 4:4-11?

19. Since Jesus warned His disciples about the danger of going to "Hell" in soul and BODY (see Matthew 10:28), and since unbelievers only go to "Hell" in their SOUL before their resurrection, and since all unbelievers come out of "Hell" to stand at the Great White Throne, and are then cast into the Lake of Fire, was Jesus warning believers or unbelievers about going to "Hell" in their BODIES? Do modern Christians need to fear this warning?

20. A believer can be made sick or killed by God in this life, and still possess everlasting life (John 3:16, 1 Corinthians 11:30). Where is the Bible verse that teaches that temporary chastisement in the age of the Millennial Kingdom would neutralize the promise of everlasting life, even though temporary chastisement in this life does not?

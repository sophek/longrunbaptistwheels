I have been recently challenged to a written debate over Preterism.
Preterism is the erroneous view that the Second Coming prophecies were
fully fulfilled in A.D. 70. This will be a written debate, which will take
place over time, and be posted on:
http://www.preteristarchive.com/CriticalArticles/index.html and on our web
site at Kingdom Baptist:

"Independent Baptist Joey Faust and Preterist Bryan Forgy have agreed to
terms for a debate. Reader comments may be posted alongside the debate.
The debate will begin in two weeks. Here are the four propositions for
this debate:

1) The Grammatico-Historical hermeneutic should be used while approaching
the interpretation of prophecy, and not the consistent literalism of
Dispensationalism. | Affirm: Bryan Forgy | Deny: Joey Faust
#2) 2 Peter 3 refers to a literal, future burning of the earth. | Affirm:
Joey Faust | Deny: Bryan Forgy

#3) Matthew chapter 24 teaches that the second eschatological coming of
Christ was to happen at the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 70
AD. | Affirm: Bryan Forgy | Deny: Joey Faust

#4) Revelation 20 teaches a future earthly reign of Christ from Jerusalem
that is to last a literal 1000 years. | Affirm: Joey Faust | Deny: Bryan
Forgy

INTRODUCTION
*******************

Jack Van Impe Ministries has produced a new video called "The Protestant
Purgatory." It is over 100 minutes in length. The actual video will be
available to the public within a few weeks. It would, of course, not be
practical to respond to this whole video. But I have done my best to deal
directly with the main parts.

A great many of my detractors often read only the first paragraph of each
chapter, or the bold headers in my book! In this, I am reminded of the
words of George N. H. Peters, who wrote the mammoth, "Theocratic Kingdom."
His tireless research was a great inspiration to me in writing my book.
Peters, who contended for the literal Messianic kingdom in the face of
much opposition, wrote in his introduction, in 1883:

"The doctrine discussed in the following pages being within the field of
controversy...it will become in its turn, owing to its antagonism to the
prevailing theology, the legitimate subject of criticism. Of this we do
not complain, but rather commend the fact. 'History repeats itself,' and
in such a repetition we do not flatter ourselves to escape the usual fate
of our predecessors in authorship. Indeed, we already have had sad
foretastes of the same, confirming the teaching of Scripture, and
corroborating the experience of good men, that no exercise of wisdom,
caution, and prudence will be able to wholly avert the evil tongues and
pens of others....We do not quarrel with those who have inherited a taste
for 'bitter herbs.' Expressing ourselves candidly and fairly toward our
opponents, we dare not return the epithets so liberally bestowed upon
us....Simple candor requires us to say, that some of our opponents write
against us in a style that forcibly reminds us of the Popish bulls against
heretics....But we console ourselves with Rothe's declaration...'He whose
thoughts rise a little above the trivial must not be surprised if he is
thoroughly misunderstood by most men.'....HUMAN NATURE ALWAYS PRODUCES A
CLASS WHO THINK THAT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS NOT WORTH KNOWING, OR WHO
SUPPOSE THAT, FROM THE KNOWLEDGE PROFESSED, THEY ARE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED
TO JUDGE OF THOSE THINGS NEVER EXAMINED OR STUDIED. The latter are
illustrated by the professor of Church history...who, when questioned as
to the writings of the Apostolic Fathers, and the Apologists of the second
century, replied, that he knew nothing of the writings, but 'what with the
Bible in one hand, and human consciousness on the other, he knew very well
what must have happened in that century.'.....THE TENDENCY [in modern
times] IS TO DESPISE LABORIOUS RESEARCH AND TO SUBSTITUTE TINSEL....When
the dreams of fallible man, now so universally held as the prophetic
announcements of God, are swept away by stern reality...then will the
doctrine of the kingdom, as here taught, be regarded worthy of the highest
consideration, and then will it also become a solace, hope, and joy under
tribulation...."

**************************
VAN IMPE AND ROME
**************************

Jack Van Impe has greatly departed from his commentary on the Book of
Revelation ("Revelation Revealed,"1982). He now perfumes Roman
Catholicism, and refers to Catholic priests as "Father" and "Brethren." In
his video, "Startling Revelations: Pope John Paul II," he proves himself
to be one of the greatest promoters of ecumenicalism in professing
Christendom today. It is therefore to be expected that he would not
approve of my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?." One reason I wrote this
book was to help hinder the falling away to Romanism that is rapidly
occurring. The second sermon I ever preached years ago contained a long
list of quotes from earlier generations, predicting, on the basis of Bible
prophesy, that the time would soon come when Protestants would merge with
Rome. I soon recognized that so-called "Lordship Salvation" (John
Macarthurism, etc.) was greatly blurring the distinction between Rome's
false gospel of works and the true Gospel of eternal salvation by grace
through faith alone. One proof of this was that J. I. Packer (who wrote
the foreword to Macarthur's book, "The Gospel According to Jesus") signed
the Evangelicals and Catholics Together. It did not take much
investigation to realize that one main thing that is driving the "Gospel
of works" are the various warnings in the Bible addressed to Christians.
In Jack Van Impe's video against my book, he openly declares that the
warnings in 1 Corinthians 6, etc. about the "kingdom of God" are about
HEAVEN (instead of the Messianic Kingdom), and that no true Christian can
"continue" in sin, etc.:

"...they get drunk, and no drunkard enters HEAVEN. 1 Corinthians chapter
6, verses 9 and 10...If there's no change, you've never been
converted....He that liveth in sin, loveth sin, is of the Devil."

This is, of course, similar to the Augustinian view upon which Romanism
was founded. While it is unlikely that a true believer will be entirely
fruitless, the judging of fruit becomes subjective. And we can actually
lose the things we have wrought (2 John 1:8). Therefore, the Bible plainly
teaches that a Christian can be "unfruitful" (1 Corinthians 3:15, Titus
3:14, 2 Peter 1:9, 1 Corinthians 3:3, etc.). He can DESPISE (ignore) God's
chastisements (Hebrews 12:5). Therefore, if he continues to ignore God's
verbal and physical warnings, he will meet with greater chastenings at the
Judgment Seat (2 Corinthians 5:9-11). Thus, eternal salvation is free by
grace through faith alone. But the Millennial Prize is through works (2
Timothy 2:12).

Years ago, I began to collect the sayings of all the popular preachers and
Christian celebrities (Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ, Packer,
Macarthur, and dozens more), and I found that EVERYONE of them openly
declared that a person knows he or she is a Christian by inspecting his or
her FRUIT. After years of street ministry, I also found that it was almost
impossible to find people who would believe that all they had to do was
believe the Gospel to be saved in eternity (John 3:16). When questioned,
almost all were basing their assurance on their works. In this climate of
works, all Rome had to do was to begin to use "evangelical" language, and
multitudes of Protestants and Evangelicals would be glad to unite and
confess that there really is no difference in their views concerning the
actual Gospel. While it might seem to some that applying the warnings to
true BELIEVERS in a temporary sense (during the Millennium) is "similar"
to a Catholic purgatory, it is, at the same time, actually LIGHT YEARS
away from the false, Catholic "GOSPEL." But when people attempt to
distance themselves from "Purgatory" in a reckless manner, they end up
having to move closer to Rome's gospel of works (which is not a Gospel!).
When one side goes up, the other side goes down! This is why some of the
greatest defenders of the true Gospel, and some of the most able and vocal
opponents of Romanism (in doctrine and prophecy) also applied the warnings
to true believers (while holding to eternal security). They may have
looked like they held a "sort of Protestant Purgatory" to their
detractors, but they sure were FAR from a Catholic view of justification!
All of this is documented in my book. Therefore, by defending the true,
Biblical application of the warnings to Christians, and listing the
abundant historical support for this view, the GIFT of salvation in
eternity may be properly DIVIDED from the PRIZE of Millennial reign.
Romanism and the ecumenical priests of Protestantism are thwarted by the
consistent hermeneutic which recognizes this distinction throughout the
Bible. This is why the Gospel-back-loaders, Gospel-front-loaders, and the
ecumenical celebrities are all screaming the loudest against my book. When
the warnings are rightly applied, the axe is applied at the root of their
doctrinal trees. But let us begin evaluating the actual video transcript.

***************************************************
WHAT DOES ROME BELIEVE ABOUT PURGATORY?
***************************************************

JACK: "A few weeks ago God burdened my heart to preach on the Beam Seat of
Christ, when rewards are going to be given to the faithful, and to call it
a form of Protestant Purgatory. But then, God is always on time. I
received a book hundreds of pages long called, 'The Rod' by J.D. Faust
[shows book-cover on screen]. And lo and behold in the book he mentions
that there were 300 scholars, and he gives the names, and I recognize many
of them who covered 100 years of history and actually preached that those
who were not right when they die, or who did not suffer for Christ while
on earth, are during the thousand year reign of Christ placed into the
underworld where there is fire."

RESPONSE: My quotes actually span 2000 years of Christian history, not
just 100 years as he states. The clearest explanations concerning what
happens to unfaithful Christians are given during the first 300 years of
Christian history, and then also during the 100-year period from about
1850 to 1950. Therefore, the golden ages of premillennialism and literal
interpretation were also the ages when Millennial Exclusion was clearly
seen. Yet, if Jack Van Impe studied my book as he claims, why does he
leave out the early church writers? And why doesn't he tell the reader
that practically ALL of the premillennialists BEFORE the 19th century
(1500-1800) believed that only martyrs and those with a "martyr-spirit"
reigned with Christ during the Millennium? The Biblical teaching of
Millennial Exclusion was revived and developed out of Mede's selective
resurrection in the 17th century, the same way the rapture was developed
from Mede's (and others) earlier "rapture" concepts.

JACK: "Well I kept reading that book, and I delved into it, and was
literally shocked at what I had read. And Rexella, God said. 'That's why I
gave you the title 'The Protestant Purgatory.' Now they constantly say
this is not like the Catholic Purgatory, but as I've studied it, it is.
And we want to delve into this now, and give you something to think
about."

RESPONSE: Yes, my view is "like" Catholic purgatory in the sense that it
is a temporary punishment. But it is no more like the Catholic purgatory
than the Biblical ordinance of the Lord's Supper is "like" the Catholic
mass! It is no more "like" the Catholic purgatory than the Saturday door
knocking ministry of our churches is "like" the J.W.'s door knocking! The
purposes and details have all been corrupted by Rome, as we will show. My
book documents in detail the RISE of Rome's purgatory OUT of the writings
of the early Church fathers, of which the earliest held to entirely
different ideas than Rome's later perversion. I cannot improve upon the
words of a recent letter, which sum up the issue:

"Mr. Faust, our in-house library has recently obtained a copy of 'The Rod,
Will God Spare It?' It appears to be an interesting source of historical
and bibliographic information on this subject. I am currently doing a
study on the subject of purgatory, so I found Chapter 9, 'A Protestant
Purgatory?,' very useful...The argument of my study will run something
like this: 1) The Word of God speaks of the kingdom reward and
dispensational punishment.  2) Although many early church fathers were not
as explicit on this teaching as we would like, what they did say indicates
that they believed something like it.  3) Some "fathers" deviated from the
truth fairly early, and... (a few centuries pass here)  4) The heresy of
purgatory is formalized.  5)  Then the Reformers, as Lang said it, failed
to 'rescue the wheat from the chaff.' Today's evangelical Protestantism
has, in fact, burned down the whole barn." (John Campbell, Anaheim, CA)

Van Impe leaves out the historical facts, and is simply building upon the
point that our view and Rome's view both utilize possible temporary
punishment. Yet, Van Impe himself will later state some obvious
differences when he tells us that he would much rather go to Rome's
purgatory than suffer Millennial Exclusion! We think Van Impe should fear
God and repent of his ecumenism, and get back to his earlier
fundamentalism. Perhaps it was the weakness of his own "Bema Seat" view
that has allowed him to practically kiss the toe of John Paul II without
trembling before our Lord who is a consuming fire! The Bible teaches that
we may lose more than rewards. We may actually RECEIVE for the wrong which
we have done (Colossians 3:24-25, Luke 12:5, 46-47).

REXELLA: "Very, very interesting, believe me....Normally, when you think
of Purgatory, you think about the denomination, the Catholic Church. And,
uh, Jack, because I think we do MISUNDERSTAND what they believe, maybe it
would be good to share with us, EXACTLY; now you read the new, updated
catechism...so you know exactly what they believe about Purgatory. Share
with us, will you please?"

RESPONSE: They are seeking to protect and sugar-coat Rome's Purgatory from
the documented facts in my book.

JACK: "There are 2865 different points in the new updated Catholic
Catechism, and I read it through twice, and I was amazed at some of the
things I found, because WE have TOTALLY misrepresented many of our
BROTHERS in the Catholic Church, and what they really teach; and Purgatory
is one of them. For instance, the Catholic Catechism, point 1030,
concerning Purgatory states: 'All who die in God's grace and friendship
are indeed assured of their eternal salvation, but after death they
undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the
joy of Heaven.' Father Charles M. Carty and Father L. Rumble, add:
'Purgatory is not a final destiny. Every soul that goes there is
saved...Purgatory is not a place for repentance, but for purification.'
Rexella, as you can see, we have often misrepresented what Catholics
REALLY believe about Purgatory. Many teach that they go there until all
the venial sins are burned away and then they can go to Heaven, because
that is how they obtain their final salvation. It is only, as the
catechism says, for the elect; for the saved, to become purified."

RESPONSE: Let us look at his words again: 'All who die in God's grace and
friendship are indeed assured of their eternal salvation...' The actual
Catechism reads: "1030: All who die in God's grace and friendship, but
STILL IMPERFECTLY PURIFIED, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation;
but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness
necessary to enter the joy of heaven." Can Van Impe really be unaware that
the words 'die in God's grace and friendship,' refer in Roman Catholicism,
to WORKING to be eternally justified? In Rome's system, one does not 'die
in God's grace and friendship' by believing John 3:16!:

"2068: The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are
obligatory for Christians...the Second Vatican Council confirms: 'The
bishops, successors of the apostles, receive from the Lord...the mission
of teaching all peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to every creature, so
that ALL MEN MAT ATTAIN SALVATION THROUGH faith, BAPTISM AND THE
OBSERVANCE OF THE COMMANDMENTS.'

"1023: Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are perfectly
purified live for ever with Christ..."

Is it not clear that in Catholicism there is no clear distinction between
positional and practical sanctification? I, and every other writer I have
quoted, believe that once a sinner places his trust in the Blood of Jesus
for eternal salvation, he is at that instant declared perfectly righteous
in the eyes of God. And this righteousness of Jesus can never be lost by
any works or unfaithfulness. However, God deals with the saved sinner as a
"son." And a "son" in the New Testament sense will never be totally
forsaken by God. Yet, he can be chastised and temporarily banished from
the prize of the Millennium. In Catholicism, eternal salvation is by grace
through works. And Purgatory is simply one final act of suffering by which
a "believer" gains the RIGHTEOUSNESS to enter God's presence for eternity.
To be found "worthy" of Purgatory, a person must first WORK his way to
"salvation":

"162: Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We CAN LOSE
this priceless gift, as St. Paul indicated....it MUST be 'working through
charity'..."

"1993: Justification...is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of
God, which invites him to conversion, AND in the cooperation of
CHARITY..."

"2020: Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ. It
is granted us THROUGH BAPTISM..."

"161: ...without faith no one has ever attained justification, nor will
anyone obtain eternal life 'But he who ENDURES to the end.'"

"1815: The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. But
'faith apart from works is dead': when it is deprived of hope AND LOVE,
faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not make him a
living member of his Body."

Van Impe is attempting to argue that Rome now teaches that Purgatory is
for the "saved," and not for the lost, so they may earn salvation by
suffering. Yet, nowhere has he proven that Rome does not view purgatorial
sufferings at redemptive and atoning, in the same manner as baptism or
charity:

"2460: ...Work united to Christ can be redemptive."

"980: ...Penance is NECESSARY for salvation for those who have fallen
after Baptism..."

"1031: ...The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on Purgatory
especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent."

"1475: In the communion of saints, 'a perennial link of charity exists
between the faithful who have already reached their heavenly home, THOSE
WHO ARE EXPIATING THEIR SINS IN PURGATORY and those who are still pilgrims
on earth....Thus recourse to the communion of saints lets the contrite
sinner be more promptly and efficaciously purified of the punishments for
sin."

"620: Our salvation flows from God's initiative of love for us, because
'he loved us and sent his Son to be the EXPIATION for our sins..." [Now
notice the use of the word "expiating" in #1475 above.]

"1472: ...GRAVE SIN sin deprives us of communion with God and therefore
makes us incapable of eternal life, the privation of which is called the
'eternal punishment' of sin. On the other hand every sin, even venial,
entails an unhealthy attachment to creatures, which must be purified
either here on earth, or after death in the state called Purgatory..."

Therefore, every professing Catholic must endure unto the end in
abstaining from "grave sins," or he will be incapable of eternal life. But
the little, "venial" sins must be EXPIATED (i.e. atoned for!) in
purgatory.

We have thus far only dealt with the Catechism, and it can already been
seen that Van Impe's whole argument is very deceptive. He does not tell
his audience that Rome DEFINES dying in "God's grace and friendship," as
getting baptized and remaining FAITHFUL to the end in what she defines as
good works!

Now compare Rome's system to what I (and the scholars whom I quote)
believe. We believe that by grace through faith alone in the Blood of
Jesus a sinner is forgiven and declared righteous positionally. He will
never perish in eternity and is absolutely assured of eternal salvation,
regardless of any grave, mortal or venial sins. To walk with His Lord in
fellowship (here and in during the Millennial age of reward), the believer
must obey God's commandments and keep himself unspotted from the world. He
should confess his sins to restore fellowship (not relationship) whenever
he falls. If he refuses the reproof and correction of the Bible, he will
receive chastisement. If he despises (ignores) chastisement, and does not
repent, he will reap what he has sows, both in this life, and then later
at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Yet, the suffering of temporary
chastisements do not in any manner earn eternal salvation or purge away
the eternal penalty of sin. Jack Van Impe finds my view to be similar to
Catholic Purgatory because he appears to have adopted the Augustian system
of salvation (Rome's view), and is unable or unwilling to see the
difference between "enduring to the end" to be eternally saved, and
"enduring to the end" to please your Father in Heaven and be crowned with
a Millennial Prize.

REXELLA: "You know I like that, don't you? I mean, I always thought that
Catholics believed that some of the people who went into Purgatory, could
not even be a Christian, but go there, and be prayed out, by some loved
one, praying for them here on earth. That's not what this says. Everybody
in Purgatory, according to the Catholic theology is a CHRISTIAN...."

RESPONSE: Yes, "everybody in Purgatory, according to the Catholic theology
is a CHRISTIAN - that is, a "Christian" who has been baptized, abstained
from any mortal sins, performed penance, confessed to a priest, and died
in a Catholic "state of grace" with only SMALL sins left to be EXPIATED in
Purgatory! According to the Bible, believers who break the "least of the
commandments" will be the LEAST in the Millennial Kingdom (Matthew 5:19).
They do not go to Purgatory! Believers who break the big commandments
(such as seen in 1 Corinthians 6, Galatians 5 and Ephesians 5) will miss
the Millennial Kingdom. Rome (and Augustine) says they will be eternally
punished! And what the BIBLE says is a "believer" is one who receives the
free gift of eternal salvation, who does not put his or her trust in
anything other than the Blood of Jesus (not church, baptism, charity,
enduring to the end, sacraments, priests, mass, confirmation, Mary,
saints, alcoholic wine, etc.).

JACK: "Right, right. And of course MANY Protestants disagree with praying
for the dead...Martin Luther opposed indulgences; but the POINT is, it is
not to become saved, it is for the saved. Now, when we get into the
Protestant Purgatory, from the book, "The Rod," by Faust, we're going to
really be shocked."

RESPONSE: What Van Impe calls "the saved" in the above quote are people
who only committed "venial" sins, were baptized, abstained from mortal
sins, and endured in a "state of grace" by working for salvation as good
Roman Catholics! Van Impe appears to be doing his best to paint the
Reformation as a minor argument over indulgences, but fails to mention the
millions of Baptists and other "heretics" who died at the hands of Rome
for these little "minor" points!

REXELLA: "I've been very, very amazed to know that there have been renown
men in the Protestant arena that believe in a kind of Protestant
Purgatory....You are going to be as surprised as I was when Jack came to
me with a certain book, and you can see it on the screen right now, 'The
Rod' by J. D. Faust. And there is a question mark under that title, 'Will
God Spare It?' Now he lists in this book 300 men or so who believed that
there was a kind of purgatory, or at least I would call it a purgatory,
for the Protestants, who are not totally right with the Lord, when they
die....And according to some of the other theologians he will be quoting
in this book, there is a temporary punishment for unfaithful Christians at
the Judgment Seat of Christ, and during the Millennial Kingdom.
Punishment. I never heard of that Jack. So actually, it's a kind of
Protestant purgatory. A punishment for unfaithful Christians. Boy, would
you please share some of this right now?"

RESPONSE: The debate over Millennial Exclusion often dominated prophetic
conferences. There has obviously been a great cover-up or at least a
repainting of Christian history. But I must confess that I have a bit of
trouble taking the above words seriously. Is she shocked at punishment?
Why, THOUSANDS of those associated with TBN and her program are
Charismatics and Catholics. They ALL believe that a believer can not only
be punished, but punished ETERNALLY for backsliding. It is true that
hyper-Calvinism and Arminianism have both adopted a sort of antinomianism
in modern times (where you have to curse Jesus or something really
horrible and continue in it to lose salvation or lose assurance that you
are a true believer); yet, in principle Charismatics believe in a loss of
eternal salvation. Why then be shocked at an unfaithful believer being
punished for only 1000 years? Shouldn't she have rather said, "Jack, I
have heard of going to Hell for eternity if you backslide, and MOST of our
viewers hold to this view, yet isn't this very MERCIFUL? Imagine, an
unfaithful believer only getting punished for 1000 years when we have
trillions times trillions of years to spend with our Lord in bliss and
glory!" But she did not say this. Instead she was amazed. I continue to be
amazed as well at how slow people are to believe our Lord's warnings and
RIGHTLY harmonize them with His promises concerning eternity.

JACK: "And that they're punished for 1000 years in the underworld, where
there is fire. And they call it Millennial Exclusion. Listen. On page 408
in the book entitled "The Rod," J.D. Faust states, 'People in Rome's
purgatory suffer to become a child of God...' Untrue as you just heard."

RESPONSE: This is from the glossary, and I am using "child of God" in a
Biblical sense. Rome's "child of God" at times means every person in the
world, and at other times means those people who have been baptized in the
Catholic Church, and are therefore working their way to final salvation.
My language here could have been better. But Jack is trying to imply that
Rome's "child of God" and the fundamental Christian's "child of God" is
the same. They are not the same.

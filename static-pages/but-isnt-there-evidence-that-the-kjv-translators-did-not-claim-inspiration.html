            But isn't there evidence that the KJV translators did not claim inspiration?

Of course. We do NOT claim they were inspired. We claim they were used by God to pick the right words and preserve the inspired Bible. But didn't they realize they could make mistakes? Of course. But that doesn't mean they made any! Luke wrote his Gospel and the Book of Acts as a letter to another person (Theophilus in Acts 1:1). There is no evidence that he knew his writings were being inspired at that moment. Paul wrote a private letter to Philemon. There is no evidence that he knew his letter was inspired. Nevertheless, we only claim that the Translators chose the right words and translated them properly. The Westminster Confession of Faith chose the exact 66 books that conservative Christians believe make up the inspired Canon. Were these men inspired? Getting something correct or right need not imply inspiration in the sense of the words of the original apostles and prophets. God is able by His providence to turn the hearts of kings in any age. He is able to insure that we have a perfect Bible preserved in the last days.

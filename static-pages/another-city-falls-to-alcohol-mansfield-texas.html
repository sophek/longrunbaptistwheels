            ANOTHER CITY FALLS TO ALCOHOL:
PLEASE PRAY FOR MANSFIELD, TEXAS

Recently, Wal-Mart, and some other stores, contributed money to a drive to make Mansfield (the city close to our church), a "wet" city. Some early voting took place. And before long, I saw in the paper that the final day of voting would soon occur. A few months before, there had been an organized opposition against Big League Dreams, since they were going to take away property, and serve alcohol in the presence of children. Many people had protested against alcohol. They had won a victory. I was sure that many of these people would be organized against the coming alcohol vote. I was wrong. Although we are not technically in Mansfield, I sent an article to the paper that was printed two days before the vote. It was, of course, shortened from the original, down to the following:

"KATRINA SHOULD MOVE MANSFIELD TO SHUN ALCOHOL!

"New Orleans City Council President Oliver Thomas after witnessing the horrors first hand and hearing talk of Sodom and Gomorrah commented, 'Maybe God's going to cleanse us.'"
(http://www.lifesite.net; Drudge Report)

Proverbs 29:8 Scornful men bring a CITY into a snare: but wise men turn away WRATH.

Recently, the mayor of New Orleans and its city officials were expecting 100 MILLION DOLLARS to enter their city from the annual, lewd "Southern Decadence" celebration (Aug.31-Sept. 5). Now, instead of 100 million dollars in dirty profit, there is a 100 BILLION DOLLAR price tag to rebuild the city out of utter destruction.

Not long ago, as I drove through a nearby city where alcohol sales are legal, I noticed the vast array of businesses and stores. Perhaps these businesses make their city officials extremely proud. But as I looked around, I saw a haggard, homeless man, talking to himself, and beating the air. I noticed there were quite a few of these people wandering around. They were victims of alcohol. Neighborhoods that were once family-friendly had become dens for thieves and gangs. Oh how alcohol brings God's rich blessings upon a city!

No! "Wine" is such a curse to a city, that God tells us not to even LOOK AT IT when it is fermented (Proverbs 23:31).

In light of the recent disaster, should not Mansfield soberly, in the fear of God, learn that enriching the economy through alcohol brings broken homes, unemployment, drugs, and ultimately, God's wrath? Should the city even start down the slippery slope of filth? I pray that every citizen of Mansfield will vote NO to alcohol. God will be pleased, and He will bless us. Pastor Joey Faust, Kingdom Baptist Church."

Before the vote was taken, the paper also printed a few words from local pastors. One conservative pastor defended the alcohol. Some (along with me) made their opposition known:

"...some area church leaders warn that lifting alcohol restrictions could increase alcohol-related crimes and addiction: 'We don't want alcohol anywhere around here, said Pastor Joey Faust of Kingdom Baptist Church of Venus. 'We would love to keep this a family-oriented, safe place to raise children...Michael Evans, pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church, said allowing alcohol sales would feed people's addiction and dependence on the drug. 'My fear is the effect alcohol has on poor masses, Evans said. Evans said increased risks such as drunk driving or other alcohol-related crimes would out-weigh any economic concerns. 'I think it is a shame and a sham,' Evans said of the promised economic impact alcohol sales would have....'I'm hoping churches stand together,' Evans said." (Mansfield News-Mirror, Sept. 8, 2005)

A few of us from our church decided to show up on the Saturday of the vote and preach to the people in the name of Jesus, and correct their wrong assumption that Jesus made turned water into alcoholic wine. Most of the voters who supported alcohol proudly proclaimed that they were only thinking of money and convenience. We were immediately shocked that not one soul was there in opposition against alcohol. In fact, we later learned that there was no organized opposition against it at all. I did not even see any signs.

I came back later that afternoon to see the vote posted. No one else was there. But I was immediately met by two reporters from local papers who asked me some questions. Out of over 50,000 people, about 2500 voted for alcohol, and only about 600 voted against it!

Tom Ritter, who led the effort to legalize alcohol, shook my hand, and said that he respected my opinion. I certainly did not tell him that I respected his. He admitted in the paper that his whole drive was based only on economic concerns (as if that excuses ignoring all other concerns). I speaking to the Arlington Star-Telegram and the Mansfield News-Mirror, I was shocked to have all this presented as if WE were the opposition. It was my intention, in representing a neighbor church, to come out and help the opposition. Instead, we were the opposition! If we had known that (and had not erroneously assumed that others were organized and involved), we certainly would have done more. I confess this was a rash error in judgment on my part. The papers printed my response to the "win" for alcohol:

"However, not everyone celebrated the results of Saturday's election. 'Evil abounds when good people do nothing,' said Joey Faust, pastor of Kingdom Baptist Church, as he took in the election results. 'There's going to be a lot more crime. There are going to be a lot more wrecks.' He was dismayed that there wasn't any organized opposition to the pair of [pro-alcohol] propositions. He and half a dozen church parishioners talked to voters outside the Tarrant County Subcourthouse on election day. Ritter said the referendums were more of a business decision than a moral issue."
(Mansfield News-Mirror, Sept. 12, 2005)

Please pray for Mansfield, as the Lord teaches it the error of exalting alleged, economic concerns over morality and truth, and pragmatism over what is right. Pray that we will be a good witness to these people, and will be able to win many of them to the Lord, and to our church in the area.

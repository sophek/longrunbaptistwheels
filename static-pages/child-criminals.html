        <h1>CHILD CRIMINALS</h1>
        <div id="content">
            I by no means wish to be understood as teaching that TV, Ritalin, etc. are the whole of the problem with modern youth. I do not hold to the error that sees TV, Ritalin, etc. as only "effects." They are certainly actual, contributing "causes" as well as effects. Nevertheless, at the near bottom of the "problem barrel", I would place the failure of multitudes of Christians to understand and preach the truth about the Judgment Seat of Christ and the reward of Kingdom reign. Along with this, I would place their embracing of the lies of modern textual criticism which teaches there is no written, "final authority," thus resulting in Christianized-mysticism. These two sins produce "savorless" (saltless) Christians with little or no effect at all on the world around them. Indeed, there are other practical sins that are contributing to youthful decadence, such as the failure of millions of families to become involved with a strong church.

I found a pamphlet in my library by D.M. Panton from 1924 called, "The Cry Of The Children." In the light of our modern problems, it is most interesting. The following is a portion from it: "Dr. Stanley Hall, a specialist on the subject, says: - 'There is a marked increase of crime between the ages of twelve and fourteen, and the proportion of juvenile delinquents seems to be everywhere increasing, and crime is more and more precocious.' We find in the Great War an extraordinary revelation. The number of juvenile convicts in Germany increased fifty percent between 1892 and 1895 - that is, among the men who have filled the trenches. The population of Germany is to that of England as 5 to 3: yet the proportion in bigamy is 1 to 2 nearly; in incest, about 13 to 1; in procuring, 264 to 1; in procuring abortions, 29 to 1; in unnatural offences, 7 to 1; in rape and other sexual crimes, about 9 to 1; in murder, manslaughter, and other death-causing crimes, 5 to 1, in arson, about 4 to 1; in divorce, 22 to 1; in illegitimate births, 5 to 1; in suicides, 4 to 1 ("Times," April 12, 1916). Now what is the vital secret behind these startlingly disparate figures? It is not education: for university men in Germany are fourteen in every ten thousand; in America ten; in England (apart from Scotland), five. The secret is laid bare when we learn that, though with a population nearly twice the size, Germany has only nine hundred thousand Sunday School scholars against Britain's over five millions. And alas, this apostasy, percolating from the theological halls of the Higher Criticism into the day school and the nursery, and so blighting a nation at its roots, continues to deepen iniquity in child-life. German child convictions were, in 1914, 585; in 1915, 1,145; in 1916, 2,895; and in 1917, 4,012. 'The increase of criminality among the young,' says the Hessian Minister of Justice, 'is terrifying' ("Times", April 4, 1918)

Panton then concludes:
<blockquote>"An undermined Bible; a hard, un-Christ-like temper in the home; the fostering of worldly pleasures in the young heart; the promotion of a marriage tie with an unbeliever; the stimulating of ambition for worldly careers:- the wilderness is strewn with the carcasses of such little ones; and by the carcass, too often, stands the prophet that lied."</blockquote>
Conclusion: Get in a good church instead of the ball-park or theater, and stand with all your might against liberal, luke-warm, apostate theology! In general, take heed how you raise your children:
<blockquote>Matthew 18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea...10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</blockquote>
Unlike the "sons of God" mentioned in Job, these guardian angels mentioned by Christ have constant access to the Father's Throne. The angel of the Lord was tempted to slay Balaam for smiting a poor, helpless ass.(Num.22:31-33) What kind of wrath then do these angels experience when someone wrongs or misleads the "little ones" they are appointed to watch over?! These are indeed mysteries, by I would not mess around and offend "watchers" if I were you. (Dan.4:17)

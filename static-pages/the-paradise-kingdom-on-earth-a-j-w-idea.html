        <h1>THE PARADISE KINGDOM ON EARTH: A JW IDEA?  </h1>
        <div id="content">
            The Russians are busy working on "humanizing" the heavens, while the Japanese are currently planning on placing a hotel up there. We are certainly living in a "spaced-out" age. Could it be that man is made for the heavens above? On the contrary, the Bible teaches that the eternal home of redeemed man is planet Earth newly created.

Multitudes of Christians have scorned this old earth. Yet, sadly, many have also despised the promise of its future regeneration. For example, in inexcusable blindness (due to the "premillennial" light that was shining all around him) Jonathan Edwards taught that this earth would one day become a burning Hell for all eternity! In a similar fashion, many with no room for the New Earth in their future plans, still sing about an eternal "mansion" way up beyond the stars:

"Onward to the prize set before us...When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be!..."
("When We All get To Heaven")

"When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies, and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there."
("When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder")

Reigning with Christ on earth in the future Millennial Kingdom (not eternal Heaven) is the great prize that Christians are to pray, hope and strive for. Although I do not own a television I nevertheless continually seem to hear about new television programs with "Heaven" in the title. The world seems to be consumed with "Heaven" and "outer space," while at the same time they are madly living for this life, and this world.

Given the space and time, I might more fully argue that one of the reasons (among other things) that the majority of those who talk the most about "Eternal Heaven" live the most for this world is that "Heaven" has no frame of reference in human experience, nor is it described in detail throughout Scripture. Most struggle to think of anything other than "clouds" when trying to imagine it.

On the other hand, I have no problem thinking of a perfected Earth. As a human being, I can almost "taste" the Biblical descriptions of a New Earth in its Millennial and eternal states as described in detail throughout Scripture.

The promises not only satisfy and excite passions that my imagination can "connect" with, they also satisfy an inward sense of justice. Along this line, William Burgh wisely noted in his commentary on the Psalms:

"...that there where they suffered, they shall be glorified. Hence, the destined inheritance of the earth by the redeemed."

This is the point of Daniel's 7th chapter: the fierce "Canaanites" presently have dominion in the "promised land"; but soon the kingdom "under Heaven" will be forever given unto the saints of the Most High!

Those who are living their whole lives to build a Paradise on earth in this age need to be told how (and when) Paradise on earth may be gained. If need be, they need to get saved and gain assurance of eternity on the New Earth where there shall be "no more tears." (Rev.21:4) Then they need to be told to wait patiently in obedience, watching and praying for Christ to come and restrain the curse on this earth and rule it with a rod of iron. They need to be told about this Thousand Year Kingdom. (Rev.20) They need to be told that through much tribulation one enters this Kingdom, and that if we suffer against sin and the world we shall reign. They need to be exhorted to patience and obedience, beseeching God for mercy, seeking the future Kingdom and reign on earth with Christ as the great prize.

Yet, many would point out that the (so-called) Jehovah Witnesses also teach about "Living Forever On Paradise Earth." Is not this proof enough that all this talk about a Kingdom on earth is "cultic"? On the contrary, it will be seen that the opponents of Biblical premillennialism (along with those fellow premillennialists who have been "watered-down" by tradition) have much more in common with the J.W.'s themselves. The J.W.'s likewise apply the verses regarding the Kingdom to a reign in "Heaven." Therefore, to recklessly reject the future Kingdom on earth as a J.W. teaching is to misunderstand the various doctrines of the J.W.'s, as well as flee back into the bosom of the largest heretical "cult" in history - the Roman Catholic Church:

"..this earth renewed, and under the special government of God, shall be the eternal home of the saints. But multitudes follow the Popish doctrine, or the doctrine of Mohammed."
-G.H. Peters, The Theocratic Kingdom

In regard to some of their teaching concerning a future "paradise" on earth, the J.W.'s have simply repeated (in a perverted form) what true Bible believers have maintained for almost 6000 years. On the other hand, when it comes to interpreting the majority of "Kingdom" and "resurrection" prophecies, the J.W's (like so many others since the dark sunset of the 4th century) see only a spiritual Kingdom way up in the Heavens.


The Devices Of The Devil


Many have noticed that practically every "cult" has some truth. [The word "cult" is here used in a negative sense to describe any organization that teaches or implies that the King James Bible cannot be understood apart from the interpretive powers of its "inspired" leader(s) or governing, "priestly" class, which they claim is God's prophet or prophetess or special, anointed servant(s) whom all others must obey and agree with if they will be part of the one, true church or organization.]

What many have not noticed is that nine times out of ten, the little truth these groups do have is often a truth that Bible believing Christians have at one point or another ignored or rejected in the mainstream. Satan is able to accomplish two purposes with this subtle, ingenious device.

First, the bit of truth serves as "bait" to attract many followers to blindly accept the organization's arrogant "boastings" in its statements and writings. The cult needs only to point out how some truth has been neglected by "mainstream" Christianity and then the bait is taken, hook, line and sinker. Many sincere people are led astray because they assume that because the cult appears right about one thing, it is therefore right about everything else.
Secondly, the devil attempts to hereby insure that a truth neglected by Christians remains neglected. It becomes identified with a certain religious group known to teach terrible heresy and gullible Christians assume that to embrace that truth is to embrace or endorse all the teachings of the particular group.

The above can be documented in numerous ways. How often does one hear anyone who calls the Roman Catholic Church the "Whore of Babylon" accused of being a Seventh-Day Adventist!? The ignorance in such an accusation is two-fold. It doesn't realize that a teaching can be true in its foundations, yet perhaps not true in all the excess trappings attached to it by a "cult." It also fails to realize that the cult has often only preserved parts of a teaching that has been taught throughout the ages before the cult ever came into existence. A particular truth (in a modern age of apostasy) lies forgotten and buried by the mainstream of Christendom, left to the previous ages when men did not have television and a million diversions to keep them from reading and studying. When the truth does happen to "resurrect" (by the power of the Holy Spirit) it is then wrongly seen by many as a teaching of some modern cult. They do not realize that the cult has only preserved what was very prevalent among Bible believers at the time of its founders.

In the previous example it was noted that many emotionally accuse those who call Rome the "Whore of Babylon" of being "Seventh-Day Adventists." To make such a claim one would have to be entirely ignorant of history, or else willfully deceitful. The Seventh-Day Adventists did not come into existence until the middle of the 19th century. Yet, the teaching that Catholic Rome is the Mystery Babylon of Rev.17 was the teaching of practically every Bible believing Christian since Catholic Rome first came into existence! It was later taught in elementary school textbooks on the soil of America long before Ellen G. White (the so-called "inspired" prophetess of the Seventh-Day Adventists) was born. For instance, note the following words of the great martyr, John Hooper (1495-1555):

"Of that wicked and pestilent see and chair of Rome, which is indeed the very whore of Babylon that St John describeth in the Revelation of Jesus Christ, sitting upon a seven-headed beast, which St. John himself interpreteth to be seven hills, and the children in the grammar-school do know that Rome is called...the city of seven hills."

Thus Satan's devices are made manifest. First, he takes the crumbs of a true teaching that Christians have rejected or ignored, and uses it as a lure to ensnare victims in false teaching. Then, he lets the forgotten truth be "preserved" through a cult known to possess heretical teachings. Next, he tempts Christians to read only new, short, watered-down books (if they will read at all). He seduces them into a dependence on visual and audio stimulation whereby they soon lose the ability and patience to concentrate on old, meaty books (much less study a King James Bible). Then the trap is set. If there is ever an attempt to revive a truth, the emotional sirens go off:

"That is what the ______ teach! That can't be right! That is a ______ teaching!"

It will be seen that this all relates to the future abode of the saints on earth. It is claimed by many (in a fit of emotional despair in the face of plain Scripture) that such is a "J.W. teaching". On the contrary, as far as the earth is concerned, the J.W.'s have simply repeated, preserved and perverted what was taught commonly by multitudes of skilled, prophetic expositors throughout the centuries.


The Intermediate State


 


A dwelling place somewhere in the Third Heavens in the intermediate state (i.e., after death while the body still lies in the grave) is shown in Scripture to be a possibility. However, a case has been made from the Scriptures that such is only for martyrs (Rev.6:9) and those who suffer against sin (2Cor.5:9, Phil.1:23, 3:8,10), overcoming in practical righteousness through the mercy of God:

Acts 7:
56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

This was the view of William Burgh, the grandfather of Biblical futurism and the literal ("normal") interpretation of Biblical prophecy.

Nevertheless, regardless of the view one takes concerning the mysteries of the intermediate state, it is certainly wrong to equate "going to Heaven" with "living happy in eternity with God." Heaven should not be used as a synonym for eternity. One should not mix eternity with Heaven in "altar calls" or when witnessing:

"Would you like to know for sure that you will go to Heaven for all eternity when you die?"

As for me, no thank you preacher! I have my affection set on coming down with Christ to reign on earth for 1000 years. After that (thanks to the precious Blood shed by my sinless Savior) I am going to dwell with God in the New Jerusalem that comes down out of Heaven. (Rev.21:2) His Book closes after that. You can plan on staying way up there past outer space for all eternity, if you so desire. I plan on staying with God where His Book closes.

Many commentaries will tell you that "it appears that after the Millennium the New Jerusalem comes down upon the earth..." Yet, they will continue to refer to this wonderful city as "Heaven" throughout their commentary and sermons! The Third Heaven is "above the stars"; it is therefore absurdity to imply that a city upon earth is Heaven. If one means that the New Earth will become Paradise or at the very least, contain Paradise, then one should say what one means. It appears that many are simply talking out of two different sides of their mouths. They are trying to teach on the plain, obvious words of the passage while they "accommodate" tradition at the same time. [The same confused doublespeak can be found in many commentaries concerning Hell and the Lake of Fire in Rev.20.]

When New Jerusalem comes down as seen in Rev.21, I am coming down. And if His Book never tells me that it goes back up (other than to the top of a glorious mountain on the New Earth) then I am calling where it (along with God and the Lamb) finally land my future "home." Anything added beyond these plain words of the Bible has about as much "weight" as the confused imaginations of E.G.White, Joseph Smith or C.T. Russell.


Heavenly Hymns About Earth


 


"Some glad morning when the Trib is over, I'll fly back down. To a home on God's earthly shore...I'll fly back down. I'll fly back down...etc."

Leaving the disembodied, intermediate state (as well as holding off on the eternal state for the time being) it must be confessed that Heaven is indeed set before believers as a "hope" in quite a different way. Some living Christians will be permitted to enter Heaven in glorified bodies before the Tribulation time period. They will be "caught up" (translated) to escape the time of temptation that will try the whole world. Yet, it is important to notice that the Christians who are indeed "accounted worthy to escape" (Lk.21:36) are nevertheless (even in the Third Heaven!) looking forward to coming back down to reign on the earth:

Revelation 5:
9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

"Would you like to go to Heaven for all eternity when you die?" Why, preacher, anytime we see anyone up there, they are singing or praying about coming back down to earth to judge the wicked and reign according to the promises! (Rev.6:10,11, 5:10, 19:14) Now isn't that something? Churches sing about going "home" to Heaven for all eternity, yet when we examine the truly worthy saints who will indeed be caught up to Heaven, we find that they are happily singing about coming down to reign on the renewed, Millennial earth! It is certainly true that the older hymns contain much more "meaty" edification than the majority of modern, shallow, repetitious, "disco" choruses. They are not filled with the "pop-psychology" so prevalent in songs today. Nevertheless, the older hymns (since they are not inspired like the Psalms) unfortunately embalm for all future ages whatever crude, prophetic light the hymn writers happened to have possessed in their day.


Earth: The Abode Of Man


 


The Scriptures place the future home of mankind on earth. Of course, in the coming Millennium it will be a renewed earth. And who knows what the final New Earth after the Millennium will be like? It might be far larger and will surely be greater and more glorious than anything one could presently imagine. (Rev.21:1)

Nevertheless, rebellion never changes. It always seeks to leave the "place" that the Lord has ordained:

Jude 1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

God has ordered man's habitation on earth. And what God has joined together let no man (or devil) put asunder:

Genesis 1:
26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

Planet Earth was given to man through Adam. Man forfeited his estate. Yet, through Christ, the Second Adam, redeemed man can once again gain that which he has been created to possesses and enjoy. As the Second Adam (Jesus Christ) is far greater than the first Adam, so will the New Paradise on earth be far greater than the old. (And remember that God Himself called the first earth "good'!) 

Satan has long indulged in a rebellious fascination with the "Heavens" above:

Isaiah 14:
12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

The devil has not changed since his fall. He desires that man continue to set his sights "above the heights of the clouds" and leave the "habitation" that God has ordained for him:

Genesis 11:
1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

Satan was obviously behind this rebellious attempt to build a tower to reach "unto Heaven." With the help of his devilish angels, those early "Babel-onians" probably had a little more "happening" with that tower than arrogant, modern man gives them credit for. Whatever the case, it was certainly rebellious. God had created man for the earth:

Psalm 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.

But how long is the earth given to man? How long will redeemed man "dwell" on the earth?

Psalm 37:
9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

This glory-land of the 37th Psalm is not "way beyond the blue," nor is it on "God's celestial shore." It is on the earth at Christ's Second Coming. Notice that the righteous do not just reign "over" the land, they are said to "dwell therein" for ever.

The Book of Daniel adds its testimony to the stern rebuke of Rome and all those drunk with her tradition:

Daniel 7:
17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. 18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

What kingdom? Obviously it is the "kingdom" mentioned in vs. 17; the earth:

Daniel 7:
26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him

Yes! The kingdom "under" the whole heaven (not "in" it) shall be given to the saints, first, during the Millennial reign, and then in the eternal age that follows. Revelation 21 is as clear as Daniel 7. The Kingdom stays on earth where the saints dwell with God forever and ever.

In light of the modern space movement that seeks to join all the world governments together into a new-age, one-world attempt to "colonize space," as well as the childish fascination with "Star Wars" and the like, it would appear that man is not content with his place on earth. Is man ever? Holy inquiry and exploration in order to discover more of God's glory in creation and responsibly improve man's lot on earth is one thing. Yet, this complete defiance of God's Biblical Revelation (which teaches man his place, his future, and his duty to God) will surely not go unpunished by Him. He will once again come down to see what the children of men are doing. This time it is going to get messy. (Rev.19)

With regard to the "Heavens," Satan has been sure to plant seeds of rebellion and confusion. He seeks to cover-up the future, covenanted, Messianic Kingdom on earth where Christ rules on the Throne of David. [David's throne was not in Heaven!] Thus, all the talk from pulpits about "going to Heaven for all eternity" fills the devil with a grin. And practically wherever this kind of talk is found, one also finds a strange, contradictory emphasis placed on "making a name" in this world, in this age. [See the Roman Catholic Church for 1000 years, as well as the Tower of Babel in Gen.11:4]

On the other hand, Bible believers for centuries have suffered against sin and have lived separated, holy lives in order to possess a "better resurrection" and reign on this earth when Christ comes again to "cleanse the land":

Matthew 5:5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

Proverbs 2:
21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

After the Millennium, all saints will continue to dwell on the New Earth:

Revelation 21:
2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

Notice the city comes "down out of Heaven" and God dwells with man on earth. Here the Book ends. Therefore, here, in the same place, let every mouth be shut.

It is important to note that in Rev.21 the "Bride" is the symbol and the "city" is the literal interpretation of the symbol. It is interpretive chaos to make the explanation of a symbol a symbol itself!:

Revelation 21:
9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,

It is plain and obvious. The angel showed John the explanation of the symbol. It is a great city that will come down out of Heaven. There is nothing mystical or symbolic about it. A real city will really come down out of a real Heaven:

"The angel's words are figurative, and John's words are the literal explanation."
Joseph Sladen (The Dawn, Oct.5,1925)

The Bible tells you where saved man will dwell with God after the Millennium and there have been many Christians throughout the ages who have understood this truth.

Sample Testimonies


 

The Bible is clear, the perfect remain in the "land" (not planet Kolob or the Milky Way). They dwell on earth forever. New Jerusalem comes down out of Heaven and God dwells with man on earth. There the Book ends, only to be added to by tradition. (Rev.22:18)

With the foundational testimony of the King James Bible already given, the following quotes are "icing on the cake." They are additional evidence documenting the falsehood of the common slander of the future reign and dwelling of the saints on earth as some kind of special product of the J.W.'s. Rather, a far better case could be made proving that any teaching to the contrary finds its root in Roman Catholic tradition:

"Who can bear Origen giving to us a Paradise in the third heaven and transferring to heavenly places that Paradise which Scripture describes as belonging to the earth."
Chrysostom

"Article 22: 'And we shall reign with Him on the earth...' We believe that the New Jerusalem that shall come down from God out of heaven, when the tabernacle of God shall be with them and He will dwell among them, will be the Metropolitan City of this Kingdom, and will be the glorious place and residence of both Christ and His saints forever, and will be so situated as that the Kingly palace will be on Mount Zion, the holy hill of David, where his throne was....now many men be scarce content that the saints should have so much as a being among them; but when Christ shall appear, then shall be their day, then shall be given unto them power over the nations...We are not only resolved to suffer persecution to the loss of our goods, but also life itself, rather than decline from the same.' "
Baptist Confession of Faith, 1660 (Approved by more than twenty thousand Baptists; as quoted in Avenging the Elect by Daniel Buck, b.1814 - d.1895)

"The New Jerusalem shall be the habitation of the saints of the first resurrection, and it shall also be the habitation of the saints of the general resurrection. Earth shall then become as heaven, or rather it shall be a heaven upon earth, God dwelling visibly among men."
Thomas Newton (1704-1782); Dissertations on the Prophecies, Vol.111, p.338

"The general tenor of prophecy and the analogy of the Divine dealings point unmistakably to this earth, purified and renewed, as the eternal habitation of the blessed."
Henry Alford (1810-1871)

"The simple fact is self-evident, that just so soon as the Primitive Church view was discarded and the Popish notion of the third heaven or the universe, as an inheritance, was substituted, then a conflict was established between the Mosaic Record, the prophet's predictions, and the supposed corrected view...It forms e.g. the foundation upon which the Popish doctrine of the intercession of saints is erected...It is the basis of the canonization of saints...and the ten thousand unscriptural works on heaven as the Christian's home, inheritance, etc....
...In Rev.21:2 the New Jerusalem, itself in heaven, is coming down from God out of heaven; and the Bible leaves it here without a withdrawal...When this earth has a God-Man for its Ruler, a Theocratic ordering manifested in its glory,...the will of God done on earth as in heaven...then we have 'the heavenly country' which (Heb.11:16) the Patriarchs sought....And if men would read the Word unbiased, this relationship to the earth would appear as strongly to them as it did to the Early Church, which clung to it as something pertaining to Christ's honor and to man's happiness...it is impossible, intelligently, to entertain any other belief than the one advanced..."
G.H. Peters (1825-1909); The Theocratic Kingdom


The Kingdom In Heaven: A J.W. Doctrine


 


While we are on the subject, it might be timely to also show that the J.W.'s actually have much in common with those that see the "Heavenlies" in all the various prophetic, "kingdom" passages. Thus, it will be proven that if a particular view of the "Kingdom" is to be disqualified because it is espoused by the J.W.'s, then at once the entire systems of amillennial, postmillennial and watered-down, premillennial exposition (which tend to make the resurrections and the "Kingdom" prophecies refer to a reign in the Heavens) are therefore "disqualified". The following brief history of J.W. interpretation will be enough to prove the case.

Many are familiar with the story of William Miller (1782-1849). As a premillennial Baptist he diligently studied the prophecies concerning Christ's Second Coming. Unlike many skilled premillennialists, (who placed the time of the end somewhere around the year 2000 based on the seven days of creation) Miller thought he had calculated from a passage in the Book of Daniel (turning the "days" of 8:14 into "years") that Christ would come to cleanse the earth in 1843.

Miller and the early men associated with him were called "Adventists" because they looked for the Second "Coming" (i.e. "advent"). Miller was obviously in error concerning the date of the Second Coming. Nevertheless, these early "Adventists" (who were distinct from the cult that would later wear that name, growing out of the same movement) had enough of pure, unadulterated premillennialism to understand the place of Christ's reign in glory, as well as man's future abode:

"I believe that Jesus Christ will eventually take away the sin of the world, and cleanse the earth from all pollution, so that this earth will become the abode of the saints forever..."
William Miller, in 1822 (quoted in The Prophetic Faith Of Our Fathers, Froom, Vol.IV, p.465)

"If the throne of David and His kingdom was in Heaven, Christ's will be. But if David's throne was on earth, so will be the throne of David's son, Jesus Christ...No kingdom was prepared for man when the world was founded but the earth. That was made and given him as his dominion."
Josiah Litch (1809-1886); The Restitution, Of Christ's Kingdom On Earth

The "futurist" view of the Book of Revelation (which was in the process of developing among premillennialists) might have saved Miller from his great error. Many that were innocently involved with him in watching for the soon coming of Jesus (such as Josiah Litch) would later purify their views to an even greater extent and convert from the "historicist" view (i.e. making "days" into "years" without Biblical warrant) to the literal, "futurist" interpretation.

Miller thought for sure that the 2300 days in Daniel 8 would end in 1843 (later 1844). Miller, and fellow comrades such as Litch went forth declaring the nearness of the Second Advent. These early "Adventists" were holy men who went far beyond the majority of Christians in their day in the study of the prophecies. Nevertheless, they had greatly erred and later acknowledged their mistake in much grief of mind.

On the other hand, Satan is ever ready to take advantage of the mistakes of good men. When Christ did not come in 1843-44, many who had believed the dates would not give up on that strained interpretation of the Daniel passage. To the horror of such men as Miller and Litch, a "new breed" of so-called "Adventists" began to base wild and fanatical interpretations on the errors of those early, more godly "adventists." They began to teach that Christ really had come in 1844; yet His coming had been "invisible" in the "Heavens"! In response, Miller wrote:

"I have no confidence in any of the new theories that grew out of that movement..."

Even so, the Seventh-Day Adventist cult was born. The movement was fully set in motion when Ellen G. White began to get (so-called) "inspired revelations" from God that everyone else had to submit to or be branded a part of "Babylon." These later Adventists added bizarre teachings such as worshipping on Sunday is the Mark of the Beast, soul-sleep, and many other heresies.

Yet, one particular erroneous teaching embraced by the Seventh-Day Adventists should be noted in light of our present study. They began to teach that the saints would dwell in Heaven during the Millennium while Satan was "bound" to run loose on planet Earth which (as they taught) would lie desolate!:

"With the saints translated to heaven and the living wicked destroyed, the earth is left without inhabitant, and in this condition it will remain for one thousand years."
S.H Lane, (Our Paradise Home, p.89)

It is interesting to note that Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916) who founded Zion's Watchtower Tract Society in 1884 was before a Seventh-Day Adventist. He had earlier co-authored a book with another Adventist named N.H. Barbour in 1877.

From those early Seventh-Day Adventist roots, one can see where Russell (and later his Watchtower organization under the leadership of Rutherford) received its unbiblical manner of interpreting the prophecies. When Christ did not return on the expected date in 1844, the Seventh-Day Adventists later pretended that He had come (invisible to the eyes of man) in the sanctuary of Heaven to begin a sort of "investigative judgment." C.T. Russell, later (after making his own break with the Seventh-Day Adventists) would write his "Studies In The Scriptures." Volume II of this series was titled "The Time Is At Hand," written in 1889. In amazing arrogance and presumption he ridiculed the failed predictions of the earlier Adventists (p.31) yet set about to make his own predictions! He taught that the thousand years of Christ's reign began in 1873 with an "invisible" coming of Christ. [It is obvious where he learned that idea.] He predicted that evil men would lose their power in 1914, and at that time the "Kingdom of God" would rule the earth:

"...we present the Bible evidence proving that the full end of the times of the Gentiles, i.e., the full end of their lease of dominion, will be reached in A.D.1914;...that date will see the disintegration of the rule of imperfect men...at that date the Kingdom of God...will begin to assume control...But not until the great day of trouble is about closing - not until the Gentile kingdoms are ground to powder and utterly removed, no place being found for them (A.D. 1915, as shown in the preceding chapter)..."
-The Time Is At Hand, pp.77,141

Russell (as in practically everything else he taught) was obviously wrong in his calculations. Yet, just like the Adventists before them, the later Watchtower organization was not about to give up on the 1914 date. Notice the teaching of the J.W.'s:

"As one of His witnesses we shall want to tell you about his kingdom that was established in the heavens in the year 1914, when he installed his Son Jesus Christ as King of the new world.."
-From Paradise Lost To Paradise Regained, p.248

What "kingdom" in the Heavens? The basic teaching of the J.W.'s is that practically every verse about the Kingdom and the resurrection in the Bible refer only to 144,000 people. In 1918, those of this 144,000 who had already died (during the past 1900 years) were then "spiritually resurrected" to reign in this Kingdom in Heaven. Those of the 144,000 who had not yet died would later go straight to Heaven to reign "over the earth" at death. Only the 144,000 ever go to Heaven. These are the "born again" class that most of the New Testament was written to. Those of this special group still living are the Bible interpreters for the other more "common" witnesses who cannot understand the Scriptures apart from the "anointed" teaching class.

The rest of the "witnesses" must submit and obey those of the 144,000 who are still alive. They believe that the rest of these more common witnesses will live forever on planet Earth (if they have properly obeyed the "anointed class" and submitted to their doctrine) as they are ruled by the 144,000 from Heaven:

"Who, then, is this 'faithful and discreet slave'? [Mtt.24:45-47] The 'slave' is not a man. Neither is it the Watch Tower Society. It is the united body of the regathered last ones of God's spiritual nation."
From Paradise Lost To Paradise Regained, p.193

Russell taught that he was the "faithful slave" of Mtt.24 that was called to be the "teacher". Yet, we see that it finally became the living remnant of the 144,000. The remaining 144,000 give out the "meat in due season". They are the New Jerusalem that has a river of life-giving waters.(Rev.22:1,2) In other words all life comes from the remnant of the 144,000 to the rest of the witnesses! They teach that the remnant of the 144,000 are the "brethren" of Mtt.25 and that the "sheep" who get saved are saved because they submit themselves to Christ's "brethren"! In other words, if you desire to live forever on Paradise Earth and be ruled by the 144,000 from Heaven, you must obey those of the 144,000 that are still alive. You must believe all that they teach! Thus we see that Rome's system of priests is duplicated. A better system of controlling the minds of men has never yet been invented.

The J.W.'s teach that in 1935 the last of the 144,000 had come in. There would be no more added after that date. Today, there is less than 9,000 of this privileged, "anointed" class still alive. Many of these are women and therefore cannot govern. And most of the remaining men are now over 70 years old. [And only a very small number of those still living actually now rule the J.W. body.] There is therefore obviously a problem. Only the 144,000 class is allowed to interpreted the Bible for the rest. And it is clear that these are all dying off. Obviously, there must soon be a change made. Either they will have to start allowing some of the other more "common" Witnesses into the special, "priestly class"; or, as some have predicted, they will pretend to be still communicating with those of the 144,000 who have died and gone to Heaven! [This would be nothing new for the J.W.'s; after Russell died they pretended for a time that he, nevertheless, still lead the organization! They later changed their doctrine and saw the "faithful slave" as the "anointed class" instead of Russell.]

But let us not stray too far from the point we have set out to prove. The Jehovah Witnesses apply practically every verse on the Kingdom and the resurrection to a reign in Heaven. Thus, in their book Jehovah Witnesses In The Twentieth Century, on p.16 the title of the section is: "Earthly Blessings Under The Kingdom." Instead of seeing the Kingdom on earth, they interpret the majority of Bible verses to apply to a spiritual resurrection and reign in Heaven. A few more quotes will suffice to prove this assertion. These quotes will show how much the amillennial, postmillennial, and watered-down premillennial interpretations have in common with the J.W.'s:

"The members of the body of Christ are begotten to a heavenly inheritance which is incorruptible or immortal."
Rutherford, Reconciliation, p307

"Those who belong to Christ are the 144,000...Of their heavenly resurrection, the Bible says: happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection..."
You Can Live Forever In Paradise Earth, p.172

The following sample list of verses are all applied to Heaven by the J.W.'s:
Phil.3:11,Rev.20:6,2Tim.4:8, Rev.5:9,10,1Cor.6;10,15:42-44,50-52,1Th.4:15-17,Mtt.6:9,10,20:20-23, Lk.9:2,11,60,62,12:32, Acts 1:6, Heb.11:10.

From this sample of verses alone it can be seen that practically every promise and hope in regard to the future, everything dealing with the Kingdom or the resurrection, is applied only to the 144,000 in reference to Heaven.

Contrary to the J.W.'s, the Bible teaches that every Christian can be assured of living on the glorified Earth for all eternity. It also teaches that every Christian has before them the hope of reigning on this earth with Christ in the Millennial Kingdom. The majority of verses in the Bible in regard to the Kingdom and the resurrection deal with this earth and are set before every Christian as a hope or promise. It is therefore plain that those who interpret the majority of these verses as applying to Heaven are themselves in the company of, not only the Catholic Church, but the Jehovah Witnesses as well. Therefore let all be silenced who would mock the hope in the future Millennial Kingdom on earth as a "J.W. idea." The J.W.'s believe the kingdom is in Heaven and that the majority of the New Testament speaks of this Kingdom "in Heaven."

Objections Answered


 


Most of the objections come from misunderstanding how "Heaven" is used throughout the Scriptures. Often it used to speak of God's authority. Therefore the "Kingdom of Heaven" is the kingdom that is "at hand." If it is "at hand" that means that it is soon to be set up. It will be set up by God Himself, not man. It is therefore the Kingdom "of" Heaven. (Mtt.4:17, Dan.2:44)

"Heavenly-minded" means one is walking by faith in the promises. It speaks of the revelation of the Word, the wisdom that is found in Jesus Christ. The books are in Heaven where all thoughts, words and actions are being recorded. The crowns are also in Heaven, and soon, at His appearing, Christ will bring the Heavenly treasure, and worthy Christians will reign on earth. None of these references scattered throughout Scripture tell a Christian that his home is in Heaven for all eternity.

But one might ask about the "mansions" that Christ has for Christians in Heaven. What about these? Does not this plainly show that the Christian will have a home in Heaven?

John 14:
2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

But why mention the "mansions" at all? It is simple. Christ is going to prepare the mansions in the glorious city. After the Tribulation Period, He is coming back with the city! Christ will then bring the mansions down because He is bringing the "city of mansions" down. This city will celebrate the Marriage Supper during the Millennial "day" and then it will be presented to the King and will rest on this earth for all eternity.

The coming of Christ is also the coming of a city that He brings with Him. The "city of mansions" comes to this earth. Christ is preparing a place in that city (fpr raptured believers) and He will later bring it down as His Bride (to use John's figure) at His coming. Christ may be in Heaven, the mansions may be in Heaven, but both Christ and that city are "coming down out of Heaven":

Revelation 3:12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. [See the city to be present in the Millennium in Rev.19:7-9]

This also explains the references in the Epistle to the Hebrews:

Hebrews 11:
15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

The common interpretation is that the Jews had an "earthly hope" and that us Gentile Christians in the New Testament age have a "heavenly" one. Yet, this idea comes from a perversion and misapplication of the word "heavenly" as it is used in Scripture. Hebrews 11:15,16 teaches that the Old Testament Hebrews had a "heavenly" hope; they looked for a city built by God! Yet, to fulfill the promises this city has to come to planet Earth, to the place of inheritance. [See this plainly revealed in Heb.11:8-10]

Yes, God has "prepared" for them a "city." Christ is "preparing mansions" in that city. And that city, with those mansions, will soon come to this earth:

Hebrews 13:14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

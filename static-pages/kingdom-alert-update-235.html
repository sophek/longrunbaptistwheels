PRETERIST BRYAN FORGY DROPS OUT OF DEBATE
*******************************************************
As I reported in an earlier newsletter, I was recently challenged to a
debate by a Preterist. Preterists believe that all of the Second Coming
prophecies were totally fulfilled in A.D. 70. The debate was to be one of
many on this topic. The format was three rounds of 15 pages each, followed
by a rejoinder. Forgy dropped out in the second round. I certainly hope
that he has changed his doctrinal views. But I have had no response from
him or any Preterist for many months. After many e-mails and an unreturned
phone call to the web master of "The Preterist Archive" (website), up to
this date (4-3-04), there has been no response or communication from Bryan
Forgy or The Preterist Archive. We agreed that we would limit the time
between our responses to two weeks at the most. I sent my second negative
to Mr. Forgy on January 12th, 2004. Today, it is April 3rd, and I still
have not received Forgy's third affirmative. On January 24th, I received
the following note: "I am sorry that I have not been able to get my third
affirmative to you but I have been violently ill with the flu for over a
week, three days of which I was in the hospital being IV fed fluids. I
must now take about 4 days to catch up all that has fallen behind in my
business, so I should have my next affirm to you by Thurs..." I told him I
was sorry to hear of his sickness. But he then continued to delay. On
February 6th, Forgy wrote one LAST note to me: "I'm sorry brother Faust,
it did take a little longer for me to recoup than I thought, but then the
burden of the work I had fallen behind on was overwhelming. I have my
third affirm HALF DONE, I just got to it again last night and had to stay
up until 3 am to work on it. I will have it done and typed by the end of
the weekend..." I have heard nothing from Mr. Forgy since this last note
on February the 6th, and I have repeatedly asked him for a simple
explanation of his delay and lack of communication. If he is back in the
hospital, then I can certainly understand this delay. However, if Mr.
Forgy is well, then it would appear that he has thrown the debate. In that
case, I rest my case! And may all observers take note that Forgy's
Preterism cannot honestly and reasonably be maintained from the Holy
Scriptures.

MEL GIBSON'S PASSION MOVIE IS PROPHESIED IN THE BIBLE
**************************************************************

Many are reporting that some criminals have "repented" and "confessed"
after watching Mel Gibson's "The Passion." First, some of these are likely
Roman Catholics that have been stirred in the manner that Catholicism has
often moved people for centuries. By the use of images, statues,
paintings, robes, candles, etc., Roman Catholicism seeks to give
simple-minded people a "religious experience." This religious experience
moves the emotions to go to the Catholic priest for "confession," etc.
This is a form of godliness with a bit of moral REFORMATION, but it is not
true, spiritual REGENERATION, which results when the Word of God is
received into the heart, and the soul rests fully upon Christ's Blood for
eternal salvation. The true Gospel, the PREACHING OF THE CROSS, is not the
same as a crucifix with a supposed replica of Jesus hanging on it. It is
not the same as a long-haired, naked, lost movie star bleeding on a movie
screen in agony for a bunch of carnal, Christian movie addicts looking for
another excuse to go to the theaters of lust and gore. No, the Gospel is
the good news that Jesus died for SINNERS, and that eternal salvation is a
FREE GIFT, not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).
Gibson's Council of Trent has anathematized any person who declares that
sinners can be regenerated by the Holy Ghost through FAITH ALONE, with
eternal security and ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE. You will not find THIS teaching
in Mel Gibson's Catholic movie! Therefore, the supposed "good" that is
resulting from this movie is simply more RELIGIOUS MUD vigorously
polluting the precious stream of the Water of Life.

The "flickering" interest in this religious movie is one more step in
preparing the world for Rome's restoration (Revelation 17). The literal
Bible interpreters of over a century ago, predicted from the Holy
Scriptures this present, Roman Catholic, "form of godliness" that is
sweeping over the world, and much of professing Christendom.

However, I must confess, that WE CAN find Mel Gibson's "Passion" on the
pages of sacred Scripture! Did the reader know that the Apostle Paul,
moved by the Holy Ghost, prophesied of the great success of Mel Gibson's,
"The Passion" movie? Notice 2 Timothy 3:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.

The "last days" are the last days of this New Testament age. They appear
to be upon us.

2 Timothy 3:2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, LOVERS OF PLEASURES MORE THAN LOVERS OF
GOD;

Here we see that the love of entertainment will outweigh the love of God,
even in the hearts of many Christians. Movies such as "The Passion" are a
"hit," simply because they offer the "thrill" of seeing a man crucified.
"Slasher" movies, with rock music, are almost always successful. Gibson
gives the Christian a religious excuse to view a gory crucifixion. On top
of this, thousands of pastors and religious teachers flocked to the movie
under the guise of being "critical observers." You know, "You have to
understand the culture, to relate to it." This is also why they watch the
other rated R movies! Contrary to their own elaborate self-deception, the
Holy Spirit proclaims that they view these worldly things simply because
they are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.
 
2 Timothy 3:5 Having a FORM OF GODLINESS, but denying the power thereof:
from such turn away.

In short, the Bible predicts that in the last days, people will be
RELIGIOUS and SPIRITUAL and GODLY (in outward appearance), without the
true POWER of God. They will deny the Scriptures that speak about
SEPARATION (e.g. 2 Corinthians 6:14-18; Proverbs 1:15, 9:6, 13:20; Psalms
119:63; 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14; 1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 Timothy 2:20-22;
etc.). They will turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, while teaching
eternal salvation through sacraments and good works. They will deny the
warning Scriptures, or water them down, even though the Holy Ghost teaches
that Noah "moved with fear" when God warned him of things not seen as yet
(Hebrews 11:7). Notice that Timothy is commanded to TURN AWAY from such
people. Lukewarm mockers, who despise those who take a stand for godliness
(2 Timothy 3:3), will defile many. They are as profane as Esau, who for
one morsel sold his birthright. It is the lukewarm state of the heart that
causes such Christians to have to see and experience whatever new thing
that the world offers them, regardless of the moral compromises, evil
associations, and false doctrines. They are like Dinah, who went out to
see the daughters of the land (Genesis 34:1-2). They are like the young
man who is void of understanding, who went into the darkness of night,
"nigh" unto the house of the adulteress who dresses like a harlot
(Proverbs 5:8, 7:7-13). If we are commanded to "turn away" from these, how
much more should we turn away from actors and actresses who have "starred"
in raunchy pictures and movies (with no public repentance), who, with a
"form of godliness," play the part of our Lord's disciples, and the very
Lord Himself?! Yes, I hate it all. I will have nothing to do with such
blasphemy. I don't intend to have such iniquity cleave to me (Psalms
101:3-4).

2 Timothy 3:6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

The advertisements for Gibson's movie (and all other ungodly movies)
CREEPS into the houses of women who do not have the discernment to throw
away their television, or unhook the antenna. Their husbands or fathers
are slack and passive, and think that God is going to buy their excuse,
"God, I really didn't WANT that stuff to enter into our home, but that
woman you gave me would not listen. And I thought, well, since she is
going to watch these things with or without me, I might as well crack open
a cold one and join her. But I really didn't want to, Lord." The Lord will
buy that excuse as much as He bought Adam's line. These "silly women" are
filled with lust. They have a lust for ungodly independence and freedom
(like Satan first offered Eve). They have a lust for the flesh (and
Hollywood knows how to please them). And many men later appear SHOCKED
when their wives or daughters are finally taken captive by the Devil.
Satan's "creepers" (TV's, DVD's, VCR's, etc.) were actually INVITED into
their living rooms with the approval of the smiling husbands and fathers.

2 Timothy 3:8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also
resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

The magicians in the days of Moses resisted God by DUPLICATING THE
MIRACLES OF MOSES. The miracles of Moses cursed Egypt. The magicians
duplicated these miraculous plagues:

Exodus 8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

Therefore, we should expect GREAT MORAL REFORMATIONS to come forth from
unholy movies (etc.), that have a form of godliness. "Is not EGYPT
PLAGUED? Did not a criminal confess and reform?" Yes, but some people also
died of heart-attacks while watching the movie, and one couple went home
after the movie, and for some strange reason, began to scream and fight
one another. And what about the resulting, radical growth of Catholicism,
which damns people to the eternal Lake of Fire? We should EXPECT some
DUPLICATION of the Holy Spirit's REVIVAL POWER in the last days (even
before the Antichrist is manifested). But what is the difference? The
magicians of Egypt were only able to go so far in duplicating or
counterfeiting the miracles of Moses:
 
2 Timothy 3:9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.

They could not go the whole way:

Exodus 8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
forth lice, BUT THEY COULD NOT: so there were lice upon man, and upon
beast.

Soon, we shall see that all such, so-called "revivals" from movies such as
"The Passion," are weak and short-lived. They are not true, spiritual
revivals, where people get born again by grace through faith alone, and
put away their sins. This movie (and the other compromised religious
movies which will likely follow), will only TIGHTEN THE GRIP that both
Hollywood and Catholicism have on America and too many Christians. I do
pray that the Lord of the Harvest would send laborers into the field. But
I do not think that lost, Catholic, lewd, unrepentant, Hollywood stars are
what the Lord had in mind. They are not even saved, much less "meet for
the master's use" (2 Timothy 2:21). The Lord certainly uses sinners. But
He always saves them, and CLEANS THEM UP before He uses them to spread a
revival (Zechariah 3:4, Acts 9:17-18, etc.). Indeed, the Lord can, and
perhaps will, speak through Gibson's movie to some people, just as He
spoke through the High Priest before the Lord's crucifixion (John
11:49-51). But this is far different than a true, HOLY SPIRIT LED REVIVAL
through Hollywood and Roman Catholicism! We may safely conclude that
anything professing to be a revival that flows from these two bitter
springs is actually from the power of the "wicked one," whose ministers
are transformed as the ministers OF RIGHTEOUSNESS (2 Corinthians 11:15).
Christians have now lost the ability before the world to ever preach
against violence or brief nudity in movies or on television. What will
that mean now that so much SALT has lost its savour? It will mean that
many Christians will soon be in for a shock:

Matthew 5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing,
but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

Luke 14:35...He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

NEWS AND NOTES
************************
-The AM Christian radio station we were tenatively scheduled on is now
converting to a conservative talk-radio format (e.g. Michael Savage,
etc.). Our scheduled radio program is therefore cancelled until further
notice. Is this what things are coming too? Playing thrash metal music,
and talking conservative politics? I hate to see Christians stations make
such changes. From Lester Roloff, to Metallica overnight! May the Lord
awaken us.

-From Dr. Wiley S. Drake, First Southern Baptist Church of Buena Park,
Ca.:

"A Weekly Nationwide 'Telephonic Prayer Meeting' will be launched to pray
for America, and to seek God's will for Repentance in the United States of
America. First Southern Baptist Church of Buena Park will begin the Nation
wide Weekly meeting, March 31, 2004 during the following time zones -
10:00 a.m. Pacific time - 11:00 a.m. Mountain time - 12:00 noon Central
Time - 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The coast to coast telephone prayer
conference will be facilitated by pastor Wiley Drake in California, and
Chaplain Mark Benz, in Washington D.C. To participate on this weekly
prayer conference simply call 1-603-488-0702, and enter access code 619110
#. The only cost is the caller's long distance service, and it is
suggested callers get a flat $20 L D rate from their local carrier, or
calling cards to keep the cost down. Bible quotes and prayer items will
guide the prayer meeting, for 1 hour, EACH WEDNESDAY, as well as current
needs against the liberal and sodomite community, will be brought to God's
throne. We must pray to protect marriage, the 10 Commandments, One Nation
under God and continue the fight to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the attack
by the courts on our Biblical world view of life. These kind come out but
by prayer and fasting. We are suggesting Wednesday's prayer call for a day
of fasting as well. Please invest 1 hour of time to join us in asking God,
that America can once again bless God. We must take America back, and
prayer is our most powerful tool. I praise God for Dick Simmons, at Men
for Nations, and Army Chaplain Mark Benz for their encouragement as we
have sought the Lord's will in this matter. Prayer for this item is
concluded, now we must go to work. Grab your Sword and trowel, and join us
as we build a prayer wall through 'Telephonic Prayer Meetings.' I have a
bumper sticker that says it well in this matter  'I'm the Christian the
devil and liberal media warned you about.' PLEASE JOIN US WEDNESDAYS, and
be a part of the solution. We will give no place to the devil, and any
ground surrendered in the past we will take back in the mighty name of
Jesus, for God's Kingdom. Any ideas or questions communicate with us:

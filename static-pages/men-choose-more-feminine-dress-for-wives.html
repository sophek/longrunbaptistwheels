Men complaining of frumpy wives were given the chance to choose their wiveâ€™s clothes. In each case, these men (who are not Christians or fundamentalists as far as is known) chose DRESSES or, in one case, something that looked like a flowing dress! They are not perfect with modesty standards, but it does reveal the basic fact that has been proven again and again â€“ men do not want women to look like men! A womanâ€™s strength and glory is her beauty. Who wants a woman to have short hair, scorched with chemicals, and farmerâ€™s trousers or sweats? Aside from the fact that cross-dressing is an abomination (Deut. 22. 1 Cor. 6), it also makes the world a more dreary place! When my wife and daughters are in stores, etc., we continually get asked, â€œWhat is so different? It is lovely.â€ I respond that you are simply seeing what girls and ladies are supposed to look like. You are seeing long hair and flowing garments, and it really makes a difference. Almost all men know this â€“ most are simply too passive to do anything about it. They lie to their wives and sadly accept their lot in life â€“ no flowers â€“ no beauty â€“ no glories of femininity. Â This article above shows again what many other studies have shown â€“ men are not happy with manly women.

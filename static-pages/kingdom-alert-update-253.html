===============================================================

Before you read this Kingdom Alert, please read the following Scriptures:

Numbers 23:23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is
there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be
said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

1 John 5:18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that
is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

As has been said, there are two errors we may make concerning Satan:

1. Ignore his existence and work.
2. Become too fascinated with him.

We strive to avoid both errors. With this introduction, let us prayerfully
begin this week's issue of, The Kingdom Alert. May the Lord Jesus Christ
(who is come in the flesh!) use this newsletter to His glory.

THE LITERAL AND SPIRITUAL NAKEDNESS OF LAODICEA
***************************************************************

"In Battle Creek, Mich., 14 women of St. Thomas Episcopal Church â€“ between
ages 55 and 82 â€“ actually bared their breasts to raise money for breast
cancer research. Calling themselves The Belles of St. Mary's, the women
bared nearly all in an in-pew photo op at St. Thomas church for a calendar
they hope will raise money for research....Cook said she wrote to her
rector, the Rev. Joy Rogers, and the parish's assistant, the Rev. Chris
Yaw, saying they would not be returning to St. Thomas, and explaining why:
'I told them both that I found the calendar objectionable, inappropriate
and that it ran counter to the morals I am attempting to instill into my
children. 'Mother Joy', whose name takes on a whole new meaning to me now,
never even bothered to answer me. No e-mail, no phone call, nothing.
Father Chris answered very briefly, with the argument that there are two
sides to everything and that if I reconsidered, to get in touch with him.'
The national Episcopal Church magazine, Episcopal Life, reports religion
writer David Virtue features this _______[name of a lewd magazine]-style
parish under the headline BARING (ALMOST ALL) FOR THE FAITH."
(WorldNetDaily)

Revelation 3:14 And unto the angel of the church of the LAODICEANS write;
These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning
of the creation of God;
17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need
of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and
poor, and blind, AND NAKED:

They said that it would never happen. They said that the fundamentalists
were uneducated alarmists. Well, here we are, at the end of 2004. And we
have elderly women, professing Christ, stripping in the churches for a
photographer! Behold the sin that a "good motive" can attempt to cover (or
uncover?)! Just give some professing, Christian women a half-way, good
motive, and they will strip before anyone! (We will leave the insane,
modern-feminist, "give me a male gynecologist" movement for another
discussion).

The fulfillments of OT prophecies in the NT, reveal to us some examples of
how many NT prophecies will likely be fulfilled. For example, notice the
following, historical statement in the OT:

Hosea 11:1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
out of Egypt.

This verse, at first, appears to be only an ordinary statement about an
important event in the history of Israel:

Hosea 2:14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor
for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth,
and as in the day when she came up OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT.

Exodus 4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, ISRAEL
IS MY SON, even my firstborn:
23 And I say unto thee, LET MY SON GO, that he may serve me: and if thou
refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

However, alongside this literal history, expressed in poetic language,
there hovers a prophecy. And the literal nature in which this prophecy has
been fulfilled in the NT is amazing:

Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the YOUNG CHILD
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee
word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and
departed INTO EGYPT:
15 And was there until the death of Herod: THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, OUT OF EGYPT HAVE I
CALLED MY SON.

This is a lesson for us when we come to such historical writings as the
Lord's words to the seven churches in Asia Minor. These are seven literal,
historic churches, with literal pastors, etc. Yet, these churches are also
representative of seven ages dealing with God's people. The Lord's words
to Laodicea contain deep, spiritual truths. Yet, as with the OT prophecy
in Hosea, there will be also a literal fulfillment. Therefore, the
NAKEDNESS of Laodicea will be a spiritual nakedness, as well as a LITERAL
nakedness!

We have already see signs of this prophecy being fulfilled in the
IMMODESTY of Christian men and women. Notice, women are especially called
to dress modestly:

1 Timothy 2:9 In like manner also, that women ADORN themselves in MODEST
APPAREL, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold,
or pearls, or costly array;
10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man,
but to be in silence.
13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the
transgression.
15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in
faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

Notice the definition of the word "adorn":

ADORN:
"To make beautiful or attractive...decorate...to add beauty,
luster..to..."
("Standard Dictionary," 1895)

"To deck or decorate; to make beautiful; to add to beauty by dress...to
make pleasing..." ("Webster's," 1828)

Christian women are commanded to ADORN themselves with clothing, (yet,
there are some very important qualifications). She is commanded to make
herself beautiful and well-ordered in her attire. Peter tells us that the
holy women in the Old Testament are examples to Christian women today (1
Peter 3:5). They did not just concentrate on making themselves outwardly
beautiful. They also adorned themselves inwardly with a meek and quiet
spirit (see Sarah and Rebekah, etc.). Notice the virtuous woman of
Proverbs 31:

Proverbs 31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is
silk and purple.
30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the
LORD, she shall be praised.

Here we have the Biblical balance. Outward beauty without inward beauty is
like bodily exercise apart from exercising oneself in godliness.

The Holy Ghost is quick to qualify the command for women to beautify
themselves with clothing. The apparel must not be costly, and gaudy, in
the manner that the high-society women (harlots), adorn themselves. They
are commanded to dress in such a manner that is consistent with their
profession. Their clothes should be an outward sign that they are holy and
virtuous. In the same way, Christian women must beautify themselves with
MODEST clothing:

MODEST:
"..not lewd, loud, or loose..." ("Standard Dictionary," 1895)

"...not excessive, or extreme..." ("Webster's," 1828)

"Well-conducted; orderly...shrinking from coarse or impure
suggestion....Of female attire: DECENT, NOT MERETRICIOUS [i.e. pertaining
to a harlot]."
("Oxford")

Christian women are called to beautify themselves with feminine colors and
patterns. But they are to avoid any garment even spotted with the spirit
of harlotry! They are to dress in a manner that openly DEMONSTRATES
(without leaving the slightest question) that they are HOLY women. They
are not called to wear cardboard boxes, or to look grungy and lazy. But
they are not to mimic the dress of the call girls in Greek society (who
were often arrayed in costly attire). In the ancient world, women were
called to be decent and proper homemakers (unless they were harlots). We
are certainly living in perilous times, for today, even many of the decent
women (wives and young daughters) dress like the bad women! Christian
women should have no part of this movement (e.g. slit skirts, open
shoulders, open backs, slit sides, open stomachs, tight clothes, masculine
clothes, etc.):

Jude 1:23 ...hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

Jesus has prophesied that men and women (professing Christians) will BE
NAKED in the last days! Again, this is refers to both spiritual and
literal nakedness. In fact, one sign o WATCHING for the Lord's return is
KEEPING YOUR CLOTHES ON (on yourself and family members):

Revelation 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth,
and keepeth his GARMENTS, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

Every Christian man should dress in a holy manner; and, if he is married,
he should also be sure that his wife and children are modestly clothed.
Let us avoid EVEN THE APPEARANCE that we are associated with this Satanic
nudity movement:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

*******************************************************
ON THE DEATH OF ROCK-GUITARIST, DARRELL ABBOTT
*******************************************************
On Wednesday night, December 8th, Darrell Abbott (a heavy-metal guitarist)
was shot in the head multiple times. He died at the scene:
http://www.nbc4i.com/news/3983630/detail.html

Authorities are struggling to understand why this happened. There is much
reason to believe that the young man who shot Darrell Abbott was
devil-possessed. He did not have a "right mind." A disordered mind,
nakedness, and a fascination with death (tombs), are signs of devil
possession (see Mark 5:15). The possessed youth claimed that he was the
author of some Pantera lyrics, and that the band had stolen his lyrics.
Notice a few lyrics that brought the band to fame:

"Avoid the light. The suns in sight....Grant me satan..."

"Spending time alone. It's time to set my demons free."

"By demons be driven. Beckon the call."

Obviously, the devil-possessed youth was, "driven by demons," and he
"beckoned the call." Satan is a cruel paymaster.

I remember when Darrell Abbott (as a teen) first utilized blatantly
Satanic lyrics in his songs. It seemed so harmless at the time to many
kids. It was the "thing" to do. But when will we learn that sorcery and
Satanism are not trivial, mocking matters?:

Isaiah 47:10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou
hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.
11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it
riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put
it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not
know.

I was grieved and shocked to hear the news of Darrell's death. I pray the
family will be comforted, and that they will seek the Lord while He may be
found.

How quickly tragic death changes the topic of discussion from, "Cowboys
From Hell"(the title of one of Darrell's albums), to talk about Heaven,
and "resting in peace"! What confusion abounds at such times. Even the
local, DFW newspaper made references to "Heaven getting louder," now that
Abbott has died. We can only pray that many will awaken to sobriety, and
that they will understand that there is no peace to the wicked (Isaiah
48:22), and that there is no salvation without faith in the Blood of
Jesus. Talk of "Hell" may make fun living (for a season), as the youth
revel in rebellion (for financial gain, of course). But it obviously does
not make good dying. Suddenly, now, the conversations have turned to
"Heavenly" things.

I am now 38 years old. I moved to Texas near my last year of high school.
As a rock-guitar player, I was immediately introduced to the local
musicians here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. As a teen, I visited
Darrell's house and heard his band play. I thought at the time, that he
was certainly doing all that he could to fulfill the image of a "rocker."
Though I have been very "out of touch" (thank God) with what has been
occurring in the world of rock music for many years, in reading the news
reports of Abbott's death, I was surprised to see that Abbott's band,
Pantera (and the Satanic death-metal it represented) had become so popular
around the world (beyond what I realized). More than one CONSERVATIVE,
radio talk-show regularly opens with Pantera or Metallica (another
Satanic, death-metal band) guitar riffs! What is happening to the world?
(Read Revelation 13).

After I graduated from high school (1984), I immersed myself into the
local rock-music scene, becoming a full-time guitar instructor. After a
few years, my band was an opening act for Pantera at a local club. Abbott
also regularly visited when my band played at a local bar ("Metal Works").
I found the guitarist to be very talented and full of energy. But I mainly
avoided him, due to the image he was portraying. One day, his girl-friend
told me at a bar that Darrell Abbott thought highly of me. This was
shocking, until I learned that behind the rock image, was a friendly,
open, young man. This fact caused me to let down my guard, and before
long, in those early club days, Abbott sometimes dedicated his guitar
solos to me from the stage. Sometimes, afterwards, he would seek me out
and we would play guitar (and I am ashamed to say - revel the night away
with booze). (For my enemies who are looking for a reason to glory against
me, you will be sad to know that I have been born again; I have repented;
and for many years my only music has been Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, and holy,
Christian music. I despise the slightest syncopation, and the other
bar-room sounds that are becoming so prominent in "Christian" music. You
may think you were born without sin, but I will be the first to confess
that I am a sinner saved by grace!)

Before Pantera's rise to fame, I once approached with an opportunity to
play guitar with a well-known guitarist with a recording contract. This
prompted a desperate seeking of the Lord (He was seeking me), and during
the process of interviewing with the band, I became a bit too bold with my
new found Christianity (and glory be to God), I was dropped, and
immediately lost the opportunity to pollute young minds with more Satanism
and rebellion. I was snatched from the fire. I then immersed myself into
studying the Bible, and reading all that I could find about the truth.

From that point, Darrell Abbott sky-rocketed to fame. Later, when he was
mixing some musical tracks, a Christian friend and I (brother Warden)
visited him in the studio, and gave him our testimonies of conversion. I
believe that I told him that music, and guitar, could not truly satisfy.
It was a shallow, false god. I told him that I had "burned out" on this
false god. I told him that there is more to life than entertaining young,
troubled kids who are holding up a Satanic symbol with their fingers as we
play guitar. I told him that there were really two paths. He could go the
way of Eastern Mysticism, to eternal damnation (like so many confused
musicians), or he could find the truth of Christianity, and the Saviour. I
wish today that I would have said more that night. But he was absorbed
into his guitar tracks, and although he was nice, he let us know that he
was not interested in getting together for any deep discussion of
religion. From time to time, when we would be street-preaching in Deep
Ellum, he would see me and he would yell (already half-drunk), "Let me get
this straight. I still remember! There are two paths - Eastern Mysticism
and Christianity..." And away he would go into the bar. And away I would
walk with my Bible tracts in hand. Two youths. Two different paths. Two
different futures. And I am not worthy of the least of the blessings I now
possess (my assurance in Christ, my Christian wife and daughters, my
church, etc.). All I know is that God's ways are a trillion times better
than the ways of Satan (though sometimes we have to wait for the true
fruit of each way to manifest itself).

I always hoped that Darrell Abbott would sober up after the "ride" to rock
stardom had begun to slow down on the other side. I know the Devil is a
cruel pay-master. And God is merciful when He allows some people the light
to see that sin and the world do not pay, and that He has provided a free
salvation through the Blood of His Son. But sadly, and oh, how my heart
breaks as I write... Sadly, this man (who was my same age, born in 1966),
will never get the opportunity to believe and repent, to raise a family,
to bring forth fruit unto God, to bring forth fruits meet for repentance,
etc. As far as I know, he died without hope. He certainly died in the
service of Satan.

Not long before his death, Darrell Abbott said the following words:  

"It was a great ride and we wanted it to last forever. It didn't but we're
back with [our new band]..."

No, he would not be back. He went the way of the world.

Sinner, do you seek the world's glory? What does it profit if the Devil
let's you gain it all, if you lose your soul? If you do not have assurance
that you will spend eternity with God, by the Blood of Jesus, through
faith in His Blood, then your death will be one of the saddest days in
history. You will perish with no hope, and you will be eternally condemned
for your sins.

Are you a Christian who is returning to your former land? Are you desirous
of that old country? Do you envy sinners? Do you long for the mire? Listen
and learn, worldly Christian! Time is wasting. The day of fruitbearing
will soon be over. The night is coming when no man can work. If you will
do something for God, you better do it today. If you have sin to flee, and
holiness to pursue, you better get busy. There is no work in the grave.
Flee your selfish bitterness that keeps you from fullness of service. Quit
protecting and nurturing your hurt pride, as you wallow in self-pity, away
from the place of service to God:

James 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

I want to conclude by saying that being born-again, and serving God, is
the greatest experience in the universe. God gives us blessings, and He
adds no Satanic sorrow with it!:

Proverbs 10:22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
sorrow with it.

I am truly sorry for every person that I know who has rejected God's
salvation and His ways. If I could somehow make them drink of the water of
life, I would do it in a second. I should have prayed for this man,
Darrell Abbott, more than I did.

*******************************************************************
THE ALARMING CONNECTION BETWEEN ANTI-ACCOUNTABILITY DOCTRINES AND EVIL
SPIRITS
*******************************************************************
I will be quoting from a man who appears to have an evil spirit. I state
this at the top of this article, so you may avoid reading this material,
if you would like to. I quote these words only for the purpose of calling
the saints to recognize such writings as Satanically inspired (or
influenced). Let us "prove all things" and "take heed" in these last days!

There is an amazing amount of opposition to the doctrine that true
Christians can be temporarily chastised at the Lord's coming. Much of the
opposition is due to the influence of devils. I do not mean that everyone
who opposes the possible chastisement of God's people (in this life, and
at the Judgment Seat of Christ) is actually devil-possessed. But a person
can be INFLUENCED by evil spirits, without actually possession occurring.
Eve was influenced by Satan's lies against accountability:

Genesis 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall NOT surely die:

This same message is welcomed today by multitudes of carnal Christians.
The Bible predicted that some Christians would fall away, giving heed to
seducing spirits and doctrines of devils (1 Timothy 4:1), and will begin
speaking lies in hypocrisy. It is a lie to teach that God cannot chastise
His disobedient people at the Judgment Seat. Hebrews warns of "fiery
indignation." It teaches that our God is a "consuming fire." God chastised
His people with fire in the Old Testament:

Numbers 11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of
the camp.
2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD,
the fire was quenched.

Leviticus 10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered
strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died
before the LORD.

Knowing this terror of the Lord, we persuade men (2 Corinthians 5:9-11).
We therefore hold to both sides of the truth. Eternal salvation cannot be
lost by unfaithfulness. Yet, there WILL be some dreadful accountability
for sin if it is not repented of in this day of probation and patience.

Recently, in street preaching one night, a man walked up and began
shouting in a disordered manner. He was rebuking me by name, and handing
out a paper with my name written on it, against my teachings. Within
minutes, I discerned a sodomite spirit, and I pointed it out, thinking
that he was only using Christianity as a cover. The man quickly stated
that he was married, and that he had repented of his past homosexuality.
Taking him at his word, and rejoicing in his repentance, we tried to
reason with him. But his ramblings were confused and demonic. He kept
saying, "False teacher! The fire will fall...He lives on a compound. He
wears a bullet-proof vest! Children, children, listen to me. There is no
condemnation!"

I am the only one who lives on the property our church sits on. I do not
know where he got the "compound" idea (and what would it matter if
Christian did decide to live together on the same land?). And I do not
know what he meant by a bullet-proof vest. Some charismatic Christians who
we had been talking to, got this episode on video. They began to try to
reason with him (he was acting insane). Next, he grabbed two drunks, one
in each arm (he was a very large man), and began to "preach" to them. But
his preaching was a strange, demonic mix of works-salvation on one side,
while he preached against any accountability for sins, on the other side.

He kept shouting out some of the verses in Romans 7 (misapplying them).
His point was that everyone was walking in sin, and so know one could be
chastised by God!

Unable to reason with this man, I began to read his paper he was handing
out against me. It reads (with exact type, grammar, etc.):

"FALSE DOCTRINE ALERT: JOEY FAUST. IM NOT HERE TO MAKE A TRUCE WITH THE
CHILDREN OF FALSE TEACHERS!!! Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
God's elect. (Joey Faust will)...Who is he that condemneth? (Joey Faust
does)....[he continues a few paragraphs, and then writes:] Joey Faust
thinks the mark of the beast is a COMPUTER CHIP that the secret government
of the ANTICHRIST will insert into the children of perdition...Look out
Joey!!!! A BLACK HELICOPTER!! Beloved, NOW are we the sons of God...when
he shall appear, WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM...and in him is NO SIN - 1 John
3:2-5 (in him). Sin is in your members like it or not..."

After reading a few paragraphs, I said: "You didn't even write much of
this! This is the writings of a man named HERB EVANS!" The man told me he
was of the SAME SPIRIT as this man, and therefore it was okay to
plagiarize his writings.

The man was screaming vain babblings. And he caused such a commotion, that
we were able to ignore him and continue witnessing to people one on one,
taking advantage of the crowd. One brother led a man to the Lord. Another
brother rebuked a drunk man for knocking the Bible out of the hand of the
man who appears to have a spirit. He was knocked in the face, and thrown
down by the drunk man, who then fled away. After the excitement, I
concluded that this man had a devil. And this devil came out to oppose us,
as we warned carnal Christians, on their way to bars, that they will meet
with chastisement (if they have truly believed) at the Judgment Seat. This
man came with the teaching that since every believer sins, THERE IS NO
DIFFERENCE IN BELIEVERS, and that all are EQUALLY slaves to sin - and
thus, there cannot be any temporary condemnation at the Judgment Seat for
any Christian. I received a series of e-mails from this professing
disciple of Herb Evans, which also confirms that he has a devil. I will
let the reader judge by his following words, as to his state:

"When the Bible speaks of 'wine' in a good sense, it is referring to
UNFERMENTED JUICE! This is clear. It refers to the unfermented juice in a
CLUSTER of grapes as WINE' HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. most people use the best wine
(most potent) at the start"...but CLEARLY JESUS GAVE THE BEST WINE FOR
LAST!!!"

This is all he wrote in his last e-mail to me. He is quoting me and then
mocking it. He thinks that since Jesus was told that He saved the best
wine for last, that this proves that Jesus made alcoholic wine. However,
the "best wine" refers to the fact that it was rich, and sweet, and not
cut with a lot of water. Even today, the most expensive juice is the juice
that is fresh squeezed (not from concentrate!). But notice some other
e-mails. The following is this first e-mail to me:

"hello we met last night. Fire from heaven to you. So you say I have a
demon. I am the witness that bore testimony to you last night when I said
'no condemnation for those who believe' because you do not know that those
who believe are the same as those who walk after the spirit and not after
the flesh. Those for whom paul prayed 'that ye might GROW UP in grace.'
DID YOU SEE THE SIGNS? EVEN THE DEVIL RAISED UP AGAINST ME TO ATTACK ME! A
man came and ripped (tried to) the pages of my Bible. But I have many
Bibles, even the Lord could raise a bible out of rocks and dirt if I asked
it in His name. Believe you this Joey? You know who I am. The Witness. My
counterpart has not made himself known to you as of yet. But you do not
believe in my message and if you did you would believe in the Son and in
Everlasting Life. But you do not know my Father or His Son. Then your
children disobeyed me and followed that lawless child in my defense even
though I told them 'Leave that man alone for what he has done to me'. But
they did not listen to me. They saw me abused and quickly took up my
defense. They should have listened to me. If they had listened to me the
fight would have stopped and your child would not have been dropped to the
floor. Tragic the power of the devil is. And what happened when the man
assaulted me again? Did I fall? Did I bless him who attacked me and
punched me in the face? I did that very thing and I told him that he would
see God. On what authority do I speak on the Fathers behalf ? Not mine but
His Sons. I declare in the earth His righteousness apart from the Law
to those who believe, that surely they shall not die (no condemnation for
those who believe), yet you laugh at me and mock me and call me a
homosexual? On whose authority do you laugh? Why do you not understand
this: to walk in the spirit is to believe in the one God sent ? So what I
said to you was true 'No condemnation for those who believe.' Why do you
lie against my parable? That those who believe are the same as righteous
Abraham? Why do your children say to me "you re-write scripture"?
Do they not know that the children of Faith are the same as the children
of Abraham? Did Abraham lie to Kings in order to be in obedience? Did he
not lie and say "tell them you are my sister?" In fact, did he not
craft the lie in order to defend his own life? Did he take his hand maiden
to do the works of God or the works of Abraham who believed in God?....But
not invisible to those who walk not by sight. If they hear the call who
are you to say " to Gehenna with you, you believer in God most High, how
dare you believe that ye are saved by He who calls."? It is his
righteousness not yours....You asked me who are you and where do you come
from? The pharisees were fond of asking such things of Prophet John
Baptist and the Messiah. And I tell you two things now that are meant to
answer such questions. 1) I am the servant of the Fire from Heaven that
destroyed and caused a huge explosion in the City of Houston last night
just as these words were spoken to you "I am the witness and I call down
fire from heaven" you and your  children said to me "where is the fire?" I
told you "you see it not - but it burns here on this very corner and
consumes you by the power of my mouth." The flames from the explosion were
over 100 feet high and I testify in my Fathers name that he did this in
order that what I said might come true. The news report says that the
power of the explosion was felt 15 miles away (and furthur) as in
the spirit I felt the blast as I spoke these words to you. I bear
testimony to you with signs and wonders that lie not, but that are true.
But these signs do not come that you might be saved. Many will rise and be
forgiven and many will rise and be condemned. I say this to your shame .
But the fire did come and the fire was there on that street corner. Even
as it was in my own words that you should know that he who Calls ME to
repentance sent Me to you. Check the news ... the lord reveals to you
his sign.. I speak to you in parable again: The three who were in the
presence of the fire were not hurt by it but were awed by its power and
humbled. 2) When the police came for me I said to you ""I tell you that I
will not be taken to jail and that I will not lower my voice, believe you
this, false teacher? Let these words be a sign to you that I come in the
name of the Lord."" Joey? Did they arrest me? Did I not shout from the
rooftops as the officer said to me "be silent". I told the officer---  I
will not comply with a man who tells me "you shall not shout from the
rooftops. You shall spare and be quiet and not cry out the name of the
Lord." ---And your student says to me "what is the new wine?" ----But I
told you that you would see that I would not be arrested and that the Law
will not carry me off into bondage. Do not lie to me because you know that
as the witness proclaims in the spirit of the word- the truth
reveals itself and the word of prophecy is truth, and as it was spoken so
shall it be. My Fathers told me that it is His way that I should not be
lifted up by men because my time has not come. I ask you to tell the truth
now..if you be able to..did i not say in the spirit of my Father El
Shaddai that I will not be carried off into prison or jail or stand before
the court or be hurt in anyway by the police. So we see clearly that I am
not a Law Breaker after men. I establish The Law. And I told you before it
happened that I would continue to shout out the name of the Lord and to
warn those who would hear...but I did not come to warn you, because you
cannot hear. But one comes after me that will warn you and will tell you
that your lies destroy the sheep (if that were possible). And in the name
of My Father I tell you that he who comes after me is in the same Spirit
as I and you will not be able to refute him either. That is why your
spirit called out to its master And said "you have a demon." and "as the
girl said to paul you are a man of God." But a Man of God warns those whom
the Father loves. You have not been warned. TWO SIGNS AND THE EXPLANATION
OF WHAT THE SIGNS MEAN: That fire should fall on you from heaven at the
sound of the voice of the Lord. (Audible Sign) And that the Law (police)
cannot hurt me or silence me. I am not under the Law because I live by
Spirit. And once Faith is come I am  no longer under a school
master.(Visible Sign) Now the officers who inforced the law of the land on
me represent the condemnation of the Law and the Fire from heaven
represents the Life of the Spirit Filled. Both came true as we spoke to
each other. The fire that descended  upon the street corner was testimony
of the fire that condemns the lawless. And the Lawless are those who say
"there shall be condemnation for those who believe." And the fire does not
fill the sons of perdition but consumes them. You have seen the people who
came to be blessed on the account of the witness. those who hugged and
kissed on account of the Lord. But you do not see with your spirit so how
can you understand my words? The police could not touch me...why? as I
told you I come in the name of the Lord. The fire did consume you...why?
as I told you I come in the name of the Lord. We know that we are both
fools. Men are what they are and they have no knowledge save what the
Father reveals. You have me on tape and I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Jesus Christ. Download the fire at Houston Texas and join it to the tape.
Let God be true and EVERYMAN a liar. He who witnesses, David, P.S : you
are a skilled writer and clearly I am not."
 
The Houston fire actually occurred many hours before he gave his warnings.
Nevertheless, it seemed to make him happy. Notice one more e-mail from
this man:

"False Teacher, NO CONDEMNATION FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE!! ROMANS 8:1 - those
who walk by the SPIRIT ARE (THEY ARE) THOSE WHO BELIEVE. You have not
understood it but that is your way. You do not know how to hear..you
try..but you cant. You simply cannot hear the voice of the master. You lay
charge against the elect. I lay charge against the devil. you lay charge
against my own words saying to me "you rewrite scripture" Where is the
verse that says "during the millennium disobedient christians go to hell"
Do are mistaken as "christians" do not go to hell. So He who comes after
me will condemn you . and his VOICE is the greater of the two. He speaks
and you shall listen. Did I not bear testimony to the risen Christ? And my
testimony is this : that I should be attacked on account of my words that
the Father gave me. What you will see next will truly Shock You. You will
be shocked. Your mind will say "why have I rejected the way of the lord?"
but your mouth will say "brother I understand this sign and "spare the Rod
still stands" ...but your mind ... it will know. Even the Sky...I do not
warn you...the one who comes after me shall warn. Dont worry. The things
that he will show you come that you might know THE LORD LIVES. He lives in
a different state but you will see him. The words I speak to you are true.
Watch for my counterpart. He will come. And the works that he will do in
the name of christ are greater than mine. Even as  I brought the power of
fire,  the power of the persecutions to rest on me and one other..so shall
you see the other bring upon you a secret sign meant for you. And you will
change when the sign is come. My brother will lift you up he tells me. 
And the sign that you will see comes from the lord and you will know that
those who believe are the same as those worthy servants who walk by faith
and in the spirit."

Dear friends, I give you these quotes to demonstrate the type of confused,
irrational, hyper-spiritual ramblings that reveal, either outright
devil-possession, or a great degree of devil-influence and seduction. I
have seen that when people start hyper-spiritual, confused babblings about
"children" and "darkness and light," it is because they are under the
influence of devils and great sin (such as rebellion against God-ordained
authority, and accountability, which has always been the chief way of the
Devil). Flee these things!:

1 Timothy 6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
words, EVEN THE WORDS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, and to the doctrine which
is according to godliness;
4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of
words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth,
supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

If my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It," is full of false teaching in
these last days, then WHY is the Devil attacking it at its very heart? Why
do evil spirits hate the teaching? Is Satan divided against himself?

The Devil always comes (in his eventual manifestation), to turn God's ways
upside down. The Bible teaches that salvation in eternity is by grace
through faith alone in Christ's shed Blood. Yet, it teaches that salvation
into the Millennial Kingdom (after regeneration) is through faith and
works. These evil spirits come to reverse these teachings. They teach that
salvation in eternity is through FRUIT-BEARING (i.e. hard-believism), but
that salvation into the coming Kingdom (i.e. the reward) is THROUGH FAITH
ALONE (no fruit-bearing, repentance, etc.). This is a turning of God's
truth UPSIDE DOWN:

Isaiah 29:10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers
hath he covered.
13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with
their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their
heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of
men:
14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this
people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise
men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and
their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth
us?
16 Surely your TURNING OF THINGS UPSIDE DOWN shall be esteemed as the
potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not?
or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
understanding?
20 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed,
and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
21 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that
reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
23 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of
him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and
shall fear the God of Israel.
24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they
that murmured shall learn doctrine.

Please pray for us, that the Lord would grant us an open door to preach,
and that we would not be hindered by the Devil.

NEW YEARS PROPHECY WATCH (Sunday, January 2nd)
*****************************************************
This New Years' Eve (Friday night), members from Kingdom Baptist church
will be street preaching in downtown Fort Worth. Our annual "Prophecy
Watch" has been changed this year to Sunday, January 2nd, at 6:00 PM. We
will be taking a look at the significant stage-setting signs that have
occurred in 2004. We would love to have you visit us. Let us know if you
are coming. Refreshments are provided.

NEW BUILDING PLAN
****************************
This is the 253rd issue of the Kingdom Alert. I sincerely praise God for
every reader. I am thankful for e-mail, and to be able to share with you
in such an inexpensive manner. The Kingdom Alert is free. The costs to
send out the newsletter are minimal. The only cost is time. And I freely
give it, and hope that my efforts are helpful. If the Kingdom Alert has
edified you in the past, and you would like to help financially, I would
like to put before you a plan that we have. For the past four years, we
have purchased property in a rural (but super growing!) area. We have
spent the past four years clearing the property, putting in septic, water,
lights, getting a newer bus for neighborhood children (which has been a
growing, wonderful ministry), and remodeling a set of mobile buildings (14
X 70) we had purchased for meeting space and class rooms (we have put on
new roofs, and made many other improvements). We have also poured a slab
for a new metal building, which we plan for our main meeting space. Our
goal is to have the money for this building by February 20th, 2005. If all
the pledges from our church come in, we will be about $8000 short. We are
therefore in the process of securing more pledges from our people. If you
would like to help, you may send a gift to:

        <h1>ROMAN CATHOLICS IN AMERICAN POLITICS</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "Washington - Few people other than the most dedicated C-SPAN viewers are familiar with the House chaplain, a ceremonial congressional officer whose public duties consist chiefly of opening the House's daily sessions with a prayer. But the replacement of retiring Rev. James Ford, a genial Lutheran minister...has provoked an uproar and raised politically sensitive charges of anti-Catholic bias that could hurt the Republican Party in the fall elections...The rejected candidate, Rev. Timothy J. O'Brien, director of Milwaukee-based Marquette University's Washington, D.C., program, told The Associated Press shortly after the leaders announced their decision, 'I am
convinced that if I were a mainline Protestant minister and not a Catholic priest, I would be the candidate.'...With the United States' 62 million Roman Catholics the nation's largest religious denomination and a crucial swing electoral constituency, Republican Party officials have responded nervously...Since Congress began this year's session in late January, congressional leaders have rushed to show appreciation for Catholics and their clergy with a stream of gestures...the House voted to award a
Congressional Gold Medal - the highest honor available to a civilian - to ailing New York Cardinal John O'Connor..." (Chicago Tribune, March 12)

We are in the last days. The stage is setting like never before. In spite of a so-called "Catholic bias" (a political phrase that is now, for the first time, being used like "homophobia" to frighten and to scare) Roman Catholics such as Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes, Henry Hyde, Phyllis Schlafly, William J. Bennet, William F. Buckley Jr., and scores of others are accepted as moral crusaders by Evangelical Christians! Indeed, many of the issues they stand for are things that every Christian should be advocating. However, nothing in this world is as important as ETERNAL life. Therefore, no Christian should be found compromising or hiding the Gospel of the grace of God simply to gain political power in regard to other issues. The Bible teaches that Christians are to remain separate from heretics and legalists (2Cor.6:14, Gal.5:20). We are to oppose them with the Truth (2Tim.4:2-4).

By yoking with Catholics in regard to worthy causes, modern Evangelicals have succeeded in making Biblical truths such as the Gospel seem commonplace or unimportant: "Who cares about doctrinal differences? Who cares if Catholics believe Jesus is literally sacrificed again in their Mass? Who cares if they pray to Mary or trust in works for their salvation? Let's get on with fighting those Liberals!" Not only will such an attitude leave Catholics themselves in their sins, it blurs the Gospel for seekers who have never heard it.

John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) was the first U.S. President who was a Roman Catholic. At the time he was opposed and feared by some Christians as an agent of Rome seeking to overthrow our constitutional freedoms and bring
about the horrible Church-State situation found in other countries where Catholics are in the majority. Even apart from Biblical considerations, Christians were not without justified grounds for their fears. The anti-Catholicism of the early founders of America (which continued strong until the middle of the 20th century) was rooted in much more than a Biblical interpretation of Rev.17. At the time of the American Revolution, the Pope was still a temporal lord ruling his states like any other king. This continued until papal rule was finally OVERTHROWN in the 1870's. And
it wasn't until World War II that official Catholic pronouncements even began to speak in a positive manner in regard to democracy. Therefore any freedom-loving American with an average knowledge of history would have much cause to be nervous at the thought of a Catholic President.

Yet, after World War II, the Roman Catholic Senator Joseph R. McCarthy took a very vocal stand against "Atheistic totalitarianism." Perhaps this started the process of convincing many American Christians that Rome could be trusted as an ally in the fight against liberals. In an effort to "keep things moving," Rome's Second Vatican Council in the 1960's "painted her face" (2Kings 9:30, Rev.2:20, 17:4). This new "hair-do" of the Vatican continues to this day. The AP reported on March the 7th:

"Fulfilling a major goal of his papacy, Pope John Paul II plans to deliver a historic, sweeping apology for the sins of Roman Catholics over the centuries, Vatican officials said Tuesday...The pope's homily for the Day of Pardon Mass on Sunday in St. Peter's Basilica is apparently still being written."

But has Rome really changed her doctrine in regard to the things that matter? Today, conservative Evangelicals do not think twice about ignoring the Biblical commands of separation in regard to Catholics, Mormons, etc. Perhaps they feel that a united "moral majority" in politics is more important than doctrinal considerations such as, Who Jesus is, how one is to be saved, etc. Yet I believe the brethren would do well to remember that although liberal, ungodly humanism is indeed a force we must contend against, the Bible speaks of another enemy arising in the last days. In fact, it directly speaks of the OLD enemy, resurrecting with all her murderous whoredoms:

Revelation 17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.

This Harlot is a city (vs.18) on seven hills (vs.9) that ruled the world in the first century (vs.18), who will come back to power before the second coming of Christ (vss.14, 16). This city is, of course, Rome. Thus, the Bible speaks of a revival of "religious" Rome again exercising power over the nations of the world. The Vatican See has observer status as a state (not a religion) in the UN. Where might this lead? What will happen to America's freedoms if Christians continue to open their arms and hearts to Rome?

The Bible predicts a "form of godliness" (like Catholicism) in the last days:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
5 Having a FORM OF GODLINESS, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

It also predicts that some Christians will fall away into what appears to be an unholy revival of Roman Catholicism:

1 Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.

These passages are very clear. The obedient Christian will not trust to his own feelings or thoughts, but will base everything he or she believes on the Bible. The Bible says Rome will one day soon, in the Tribulation, gain power over the nations and persecute the saints again. Although Roman Catholics have as much right as any other Americans to believe as they choose and to run for office, etc., obedient Christians also have the right and the responsibility to remind everyone of where everything is truly going once the latest "falling away" is completed (Rev.17):

Revelation 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

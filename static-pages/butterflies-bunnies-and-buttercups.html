            PART 1: BUTTERFLIES, BUNNIES AND BUTTERCUPS: THE LAODICEAN DOWNGRADE OF THE JUDGMENT SEAT AND THE TERROR OF THE LORD

(Joey Faust Replies to the new booklet by Herb Evans on the Judgment Seat of Christ)

This paper is not meant to be a complete defense of the doctrine of Millennial Exclusion. The reader is encouraged to purchase my 440 page book on this subject. Brother Herb Evans is a Christian in Pennsylvania who often writes many articles and sends them out through E-mail, etc. He often debates on various Baptist lists. He is mainly known for some good material he has written in defense of King James Onlyism. After attacking my book and repeatedly refusing a public debate, Herb has decided to put together a booklet in response to my book The Rod: Will God Spare It?. The following is my reply to his booklet. May the Lord open his eyes.

My reply here is largely unnecessary. My book already anticipated almost every objection Herb raises and answers it under a chapter called, "Objections Answered." (Herb apparently did not read this far in my book, since he does not deal with any of the answers I gave.) For the reader's easy reference, we will number the objections and answers below:

1. Herb writes: "Either edition is the most damaging attack on Independent, Fundamental, Baptist soteriology that has come along in quite a while."

Too much of â€œmodern,â€ fundamental soteriology often makes salvation in eternity a rigorous, works-based, life-long attempt to gain assurance, while it perverts the Scriptures in regard to the Judgment Seat by shearing it of anything that could truly be called "terror" (2 Cor.5:9-11). This particular branch of modern, Baptist soteriology/eschatology is in many ways nothing more than a yin and yang of Romanism mixed with antinomianism. What strange bedfellows! It is largely Romanism in regard to salvation assurance, and antinomian in regard to the Judgment Seat. Herb would like to pretend that ALL Independent, Fundamental Baptists agree with him, and disagree with me. I have learned recently that this is not the case. (He certainly has most of modern tradition and emotion on his side.) Furthermore, my book documents that many earlier fundamental Baptists shared my convictions. And many others were closer to my view than Herb's view. Yet, at this point, we must ask WHY my book is an attack on "soteriology"? I, and all the earlier writers on accountability I quote, believe that salvation in eternity is by grace, through faith alone, and that no saint will fail to be with Jesus in eternity, regardless of how fruitless he or she is in life. Our view, therefore, contains much more BIBLICAL GRACE than Herb's "endure to the end to try to make sure you are not a false professor" view! The debate is over what can happen to unfaithful saints (who do not repent) BEFORE the LAST DAY of eternity (i.e. the Great White Throne). In other words, the debate is over what may happen to some Christians during the Millennial Kingdom. If Herb wants to imply that the doctrine that some Christians may be banished during the MILLENNIUM is an attack on the doctrine of salvation in ETERNITY, I am at a loss to understand why! I say the unfruitful, but true, believer is banished 1000 years (which is a microscopic DROP compared to the trillions of years of endless eternity). But Herb says that the unfruitful believer is not a REAL Christian, and that therefore his punishment will be endless torment in the Lake of Fire. My view allows all believers in the Gospel to be secure in their eternal salvation IN SPITE of their works or degree of fruit-bearing. Herb's view forces all believers to spend their whole lives examining their works and fruit in order to try to PROVE they are really believers. They must obviously, then, wait until the end of life, to look back over their whole course and try to determine if they were "fruitful," and therefore, "true." Yet the Bible says that only God can truly judge hearts (1 Corinthians 4:3-5). Therefore, Herb's first accusation against us is a good example of how guilty parties often feel the need to, first, quickly accuse their opponents of the very thing they know they will be accused of!

2. Herb writes: "In his book, Faust quotes extensively many dead writers (Pember, Govett, Panton, etc.) to convince believers in this century, when these dead writers could not convince (with any significant success) believers in their time and thereafter."

How does Herb arrive at the conclusion that the writers quoted in my book did not convince many people? My book proves the opposite! He knows his readers probably will not read through my book and see the historic documentation for themselves. Furthermore, even if it could be stated that their precise views concerning the Judgment Seat were never extremely popular, what would one expect? Is this how we judge truth?:

Luke 16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

My book shows that an amazing number of earlier saints (who each influenced multitudes in their ministries) shared these convictions. Yet, the view is anchored on Scripture, not man. And I only quote these men to prove that earlier generations were more open to the fear of God, and a strong judgment seat, than this generation.

3. Herb writes: "The one difference between the isolated comments of many of these writers and Joey Faust is that Joey Faust seeks to systematize his doctrine of believers in hell and the lake of fire by using their peripheral statements and adding to them his own imaginative and fanciful theories."

ISOLATED comments? Where is the proof for this statement? Herb offers NO DOCUMENTATION or EXAMPLE of what he is referring to here. Is he suggesting that Pember, Govett, Tertullian, Panton, Craig, Nee, etc. did not openly and continually teach that believers could be slain at the judgment seat and banished to a place of darkness and fire in the underworld, to be chastised according to their deserts? My book proves otherwise. We would like to see Herb back up his various assertions such as this; otherwise he is simply creating straw men for readers whom he knows (or perhaps hopes) will never examine the issue first hand for themselves.

4. Herb writes: "The other difference is the degree and sadistic severity to which Joey goes about his theory that believers are slain by God at the Judgment Seat of Christ and cast into the lake of fire for a time."

Herb first uses the word "sadistic." This is the emotional technique the Universalists use to deny eternal torment. Does Herb think that God is "sadistic" for tormenting unbelievers for trillions of years on out into eternity? Does Herb think that God is "sadistic" for giving some believers sickness and death in this life for not honoring the Lord's Supper with reverence (1 Corinthians 11)? With such examples before us, how could anyone think that it would be "sadistic" for the Lord to chastise unfaithful believers who have spurned His warnings and grace when He returns on the day of JUDGMENT? It also appears that Herb wants the reader to think he is FAMILIAR with 19th century (and early 20th century) premillennial eschatology. He appears to be saying that Govett, Pember, Craig, Nee, etc. did not go to the DEGREE that I go to in interpreting the warnings. But where is his documentation or proof? Herb's writings are filled with this type of lazy argumentation, that hopes the reader is either ignorant, or too lazy, or too emotional prejudiced to check the sources for himself. Besides the men that I quoted who shared my convictions, my book also certainly shows that there were many men that taught some type of literal stripes at the judgment seat, followed by Millennial exclusion, who did not ELABORATE with further details. But others did elaborate. And where the Bible speaks clearly, he is no fool who seeks to study it and understand its meaning. The fact that there are some modern men who greatly desire that we would simply let this information lie dormant in the Bible (with no exposition), is of no concern to us. Bonar once wrote:

"With regard to such details of the future as we speak of, there are two sorts of inquiries - inquiries into what God has revealed, and inquiries into what God has not revealed. As to the latter, I would hand them over, freely and without scruple, to the unsparing condemnation of all who love the truth....But so long as our investigations relate to the former only, so long are we in the path of duty, from which it is our peril if we step aside. Nay, the very example of these timid friends refutes their own arguments. They have gone a certain way along the same path; and all that we want is that they should go a little farther, but still only so far as the road lies open, and as God gives light....The presumption is all the other way. It is the presumption of closing the ear against the voice of God - the presumption of professing to decide how much of God's Word may be studied with safety, and how much ought to be neglected as mysterious and unprofitable."

Bonar's words certainly apply to this modern controversy concerning the Judgment Seat of Christ. Herb (and others) often reply: "These are Scriptures that the Campbellites and Charismatics use." Yet they certainly MEAN something! Herb pretends that because others use them wrongly, that such renders them off limits for study and application! My book shows that earlier generations were far more inclined to study and preach these Scriptures to Christians.

5. Herb writes: "Unfortunately, due to the pillared reputation of some of these writers, the preachers of that era, for some reason, gave them a pass and did not challenge them on their peripheral doctrines, which Joey is using to prove his lake of fire doctrine, i.e., kingdom exclusion and punishment at the judgment seat of Christ."

Herb again shows his lack of information concerning premillennial history. The periodicals and prophetic conferences of the time were literally FILLED with debates and articles on the subject of Millennial exclusion. Men such as Bullinger, Sir Robert Anderson and Pink did their best to resist the teaching with hyper-dispensational and amillennial reasonings. Yet, prophetic writers such as Pember remained, for years, the foremost speakers at premillennial prophetic conferences around the world.

6. Herb writes: "Very few of them went as far as to suggest that God kills Christians at the Judgment Seat and afterwards throws carnal believers into the Lake of Fire and Hell."

Even Herb, the Judgment Seatâ€™s most zealous, self-appointed adversary, is forced to admit that SOME did teach my views. And we would expect him to minimize and downplay the documentation! I document in detail that the early premillennialists of the first few centuries, and later men such as Govett, Pember, Craig, Nee, etc. openly taught this view. Scores of other popular teachers endorsed these men and stated that they believed in their views concerning a partial reign. Herb believes other doctrines that have far less historical support. My purpose in including the extensive historical documentation was to remove the main objection against it: â€œBut if this is true, why are you the first person to find it in the Bible?â€ I reveal that this truth is found in history wherever there is a revival of premillennialism and literal interpretation.

7. Herb writes: "Make no mistake about it, Joey Faust is out to obviate, void, and steal the precious promises that the Lord gives to His people."

No, Joey Faust is out to reinforce the precious promises by rightly applying warnings to believers to the Millennial Kingdom instead of to eternity, thereby stealing the assurance of eternal salvation from Christians. Furthermore, God has just as much promised to chastise at the Judgment Seat as He has promised to save in eternity. I teach that there are some PROMISES that most believers in this age have forgotten or ignored.

8. Herb writes: "Faust has absolutely no scripture to get believers into the Lake of Fire or Hell, much less to get them out of either."

"Believers"? Herb is now being extremely silly. We would like to ask Herb to show us all his Scriptures that say, "These warnings to Christian disciples are not really to saved people. They are to professors only." Herb has NO Scripture that teaches this. Yet it is the foundation of his whole denial. Notice the following Scriptures to BELIEVERS:

Matthew 5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his DISCIPLES came unto him:
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught THEM, saying,
13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
22 But I say UNTO YOU, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of HELL FIRE.

Hebrews 10:24 And let US consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
26 For if WE sin wilfully after that WE have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose YE, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was SANCTIFIED, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
30 For WE KNOW HIM that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge HIS PEOPLE.

Revelation 2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto THE CHURCHES; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the SECOND DEATH.

Matthew 10:27 What I tell YOU in darkness, that speak YE in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that PREACH YE upon the housetops.
28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without YOUR Father.

2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore WE labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
10 For WE must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that EVERY ONE may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good OR BAD.
11 Knowing therefore the TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

The above words are all plain enough. My opponents must explain them away. These are just a few of the MANY Scriptures that are expounded upon in detail in my book. The attempts by Herb to duck them would be laughable, if the issue was not so serious.

9. Herb writes: "The modus operandi of Faust is to use imaginative parabolic teaching, allegorical comments, obscure O.T. passages, Gospel exchanges (in which it is not always easy to know who is meant unless you have a false teaching you want to prove), innuendo, inference, suggestion, intimidating pontification, and almost every 'Lose Your Salvationist' proof text of the Arminians to attempt to convince his readers of his heresy."

Here Herb wants the reader to think that the warnings in the Lord's parables are not literal. Yet my book proves that when Jesus gives a parabolic warning, the warning is literal, though it is framed in figures (Jesus shows us how to interpret parables in Matthew 13. The judgments in the parables are always literal). Herb does not document where I have used "allegorical comments." He also did not document where I used "obscure O.T. passages." It is very easy to know WHO is meant in the "Gospel exchanges" I used in my book, as long as one BELIEVES Scripture. A person may not LIKE what he finds. But this is nothing new. In Mark 9, Jesus is talking to JOHN. In Matthew 5, Jesus is talking to DISCIPLES whom He calls the light of the world and salt of the earth and children of their Father. He later commands His disciples to teach these earlier teachings to all the Gentiles (Matthew 28). As far as the "lose your salvation" proof-texts, Herb has never been able to deal with them in any other manner than by attempting to neutralize them with opposing Scriptures which teach eternal security. But this only ends in a "draw." My book shows that these Scriptures mean exactly what they say, but that they refer to the Millennial Kingdom (for example, read through Mark 9 and see how the "kingdom" is the context, not the Last Day of eternity - John 12).

10. Herb writes: "Our approach to Joey Faust's heresy is not to try to explain every one of his suggestive proof text spins, although we have answered more than a few - either here or in another writing..."

We do not believe Herb is ABLE to deal with these proof-texts in any real way, other than to make a few brief statements or emotional jabs. At times he uses hyper-dispensationalism, at other times he uses hyper-Calvinism, and at other times he simply says, â€œThis is the passage that the â€˜lose your salvationistsâ€™ use.â€ In one article, Herb went through over 40 Scripture proof-texts and simply said to each: â€œThere is nothing in the verse about the Lake of Fire.â€ Herb did not take the time to EXPLAIN the verses. And he failed to realize that his â€œargument,â€ would not only allow Christians to escape their warnings, but, if it had any real weight, would allow UNBELIEVERS to escape their own eternal warnings!

11. Herb writes: "Instead, we have taken the approach of pitting Joey Faust against the plain, clear, understandable promises of our Lord Himself..."

These promises of the Lord teach that the believer will be raised up to experience eternal life on the LAST DAY (John 6), which Jesus Himself refers to the day lost people are also raised up to perish. Therefore, the LAST DAY is the day of the Great White Throne, which is AFTER the Millennium:

John 12:44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the LAST DAY.

The LAST DAY is the day when lost Pharisees will be judged. This is the CONTEXT of the comforting resurrection promises (through belief alone) upon which Herb's arguments are based:

John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the LAST DAY.
40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the LAST DAY.
44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the LAST DAY.
54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the LAST DAY.

The context in every passage is FAITH ALONE, which allows a believer to live forever at the GREAT WHITE THRONE. But Hebrews teaches that there is another day called the SEVENTH DAY which we are to enter by faith and PATIENCE. It is the Millennium (Hebrews 4). Paul labored to attain unto this early resurrection "if by any means" (Philippians 3:11). Herb never deals with such arguments in my book. It would mean that he would have to READ it. I do believe there will be others, with less apparent laziness, who will take the time to read the book, and will attempt to refute its arguments. We welcome this as a breath of fresh air. But to get back to Herb's above point: He has now CONTRADICTED HIMSELF. Over and over again he has stated that warnings in the Gospels cannot apply to true believers today; yet he has already told us that his MAIN APPROACH in refuting the book is to use PROMISES OF JESUS TO HIS DISCIPLES! Can the reader now see the double-tongued folly in much of the fundamental scholarship of this generation - at least as it pertains to the Lord's warnings? We are to ignore the Lord's warnings to the salt of the earth and light of the world (even though Matthew 28 teaches that these warnings are to be taught to baptized converts), yet we are to then form a blockade against the other warnings throughout the New Testament by appealing to SWEET PROMISES that JESUS GAVE to the SALT OF THE EARTH and LIGHT OF THE WORLD!

12. Herb writes: "The unmitigated gall and arrogance of Joey Faust to suggest that some believers, who have spent more than 1900 hundred years in heaven will find out that they must go to the lake of fire and hell at the judgment seat, staggers our imagination."

Herb offers no proof that DISOBEDIENT Christians die and go to Heaven. Many of the most popular, early Baptists did not believe that ANY Christian died and went to Heaven (J.R. Graves, etc.). They believed they still went to the heart of the earth (paradise). I will allow that faithful, overcoming Christians may go to a place in the Heavens (Acts 7:59). But where is Herb's evidence that CARNAL Christians, who do not repent, will go to Heaven when they die? Furthermore, EVEN IF THEY DID, what evidence is this that they will not one day face true judgment in the BODY? Does future judgment render present mercy and comfort automatically out of bounds? Was not David's sins of adultery and murder "put away"? Yet, did not he still face FUTURE consequences? Is not Satan, who has been pronounced guilty of rebellion, still free to roam the earth in the present? Yet, is not he also destined for future punishment and torment? The objection PROVES nothing. It is a weak limb to attempt to nullify clear warnings by such reasonings.

13. We have now dealt with Herb's introduction. Herb opens his book with the following Scripture: "And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged EVERY MAN according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. - Rev 20:13,14"

Yet, this Scripture is quoted repeatedly in my book, since it reveals to a King James Bible believer that HELL is not the place of absolute eternal torment for the lost. It is a temporary place of judgment until after the Millennium. This Scripture is dealing with the Last Day, when no believer will be separated from Jesus and the bliss of eternity.

14. Herb writes: "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? (Joey Faust)...Who is he that condemneth? (Joey Faust). It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US. Who shall SEPARATE us from the Love of Christ? (Joey Faust) ...For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life (nor Joey Faust although he tries) shall be able to SEPARATE us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. - Rom. 8:33-39."

Chastisement at the Judgment Seat and banishment from the Lord during the Millennium do not separate us from Christ's love. The Scripture is given to refute the Satanic suggestion that TRIALS are a proof that God does not love us or that He is against us (Philippians 1:28). Yet, the manner in which Herb is using it (to try to prove that God will not temporarily kill or banish some saints) actually proves TOO MUCH. For it would not only contradict the doctrine that God can chastise and kill some saints at the JUDGMENT SEAT; it would contradict the doctrine that God can and does make some saints sick, and kill others, IN THIS LIFE (1 Corinthians 11, etc.)! But the chastising rod is rather a proof of God's love, than a denial of it:

Proverbs 3:12 For whom the LORD LOVETH he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.

Proverbs 13:24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that LOVETH him chasteneth him betimes.

If it can be proven that correction and chastisement extend to the Judgment Seat of Christ, then we would only have to examine its nature in this life to know what may occur there. When we look in the Bible, we find that correction in this life is often sickness, pain and death! It therefore follows that these things are not against the love of Christ and the Father. If they are not against the love of Christ now, in this day of His longsuffering, temporary death will not be against the love of Christ when He returns to JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.

15. Herb writes: "....all contrary to the Bible, since only believers' works are burned."

Herb imagines a judgment where WORKS may be burned, yet the man who committed the works is not harmed. He therefore invents only a figurative judgment! The fact that the Bible uses figures does not mean that the judgment will be figurative. Matthew 13 reveals that parables and figures are always literal as they relate to judgment. Notice the Scripture in 1 Corinthians 3:

1 Corinthians 3:13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God DESTROY; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

First, Paul plainly says the MAN will be saved, yet so as by FIRE. The fact that the fire tried the works does not mean that literal DIVINE fire will not hurt the MAN. Herb does not read the passage to its completion. Verse 17 INTERPRETS the figure! He that defiles his temple (bringing forth only wood, hay and stubble) will be DESTROYED. Here it is not the WORKS that are destroyed, but the MAN. "Destroyed" does not mean annihilated. It answers to the â€œyet so as by fire,â€ which is not figurative. Jesus uses the same approach (framing LITERAL fire judgments in parables) in Matthew 13, where He warns the wicked. Verse 17 of 1 Corinthians 3, reveals that we are dealing with the same type of Biblical warning to believers.

16. Herb writes: "Faust even REVERSES the biblical order of hell's occupants being cast into the lake of fire TO the lake of fire occupants being cast into hell, all without the benefit of scripture."

Herb only imagines this because he is attempting to refute a book which he will not READ. My book reveals that God is a consuming fire (Deuteronomy 4:24, Hebrews 12:29, Isaiah 30:33, etc.). His fiery breath will light the flame that will one day become the Lake of Fire. To stand before His THRONE in judgment, is to stand before His fiery breath. Therefore, carnal Christians will first meet with this FLAME (cut asunder), before they are temporarily banished (with the unbelievers).

17. Herb writes: "Contrary to Faust's view, all death and hell inhabitants will be cast into the lake of fire after THEY are JUDGED at the Great White Throne."

This is the main problem with Herb's objections. He hardly ever grounds them in Scripture. He uses the word "all" in the above statement. But notice what the BIBLE actually states:

Revelation 20:15 And WHOSOEVER WAS NOT found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

Herb ignores the above qualification. The phrase implies that there will be some people found in the Book of Life at this time. It is only in the new heaven and the new earth (after the Millennium) that we are told that there will be no more pain and death (Revelation 21:4). At the GWT, there will people who come up out of Hell (underworld) that ARE in the Book of Life. They are raised up according to Christâ€™s promises in John 6 concerning the LAST DAY.

18. Herb writes: "The Unconditional Promises to ALL JSOC Believers....For ye ARE DEAD, and your life is HID with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then SHALL ye also appear with him IN GLORY. Col. 3:3,4."

Again, Herb assumes this promise is without conditions. The verses before and after the verses Herb quoted reveal that this promise is conditional:

Colossians 3:2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
5 Mortify THEREFORE your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:

Here we are told that believers should set their affection on things above. They should mortify their members since God PUNISHES these sins. Paul continues in the following verses to state the conditions (explaining how a holy life will be manifested). He then concludes this chapter with the following warning to these saints:

Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
25 But HE THAT DOETH WRONG SHALL RECEIVE for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

The CONTEXT is the appearing of Christ when some shall receive the reward of the inheritance. This passage teaches that some saints will appear in glory and others will be rewarded according to their disobedience!:

2 Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good OR BAD.

We are told elsewhere that all believers do not appear in glory at the Lord's appearing. Some saints will be ashamed at this time:

1 John 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

19. Herb writes: "...whether we wake or sleep, we should live TOGETHER with him. - 1 Thess. 5:10.... For God hath NOT appointed us to WRATH, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live TOGETHER with him. Wherefore COMFORT yourselves TOGETHER ...- 1 Thess. 5:9-11....concerning them which are asleep, that ye SORROW NOT, even as others which have no hope ...Wherefore COMFORT one another with these words. - 1 Thess. 4:13,18."

Herb fails to read the word SHOULD in verse 10 of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. It is used in this passage the same way Peter uses it:

1 Peter 3:9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto CALLED, that ye SHOULD inherit a blessing.
10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.

Christians are called and appointed to wear a crown, appear in glory, and escape the wrath or terror of the Lord at the judgment seat (2 Cor.5:11). Jesus has made all the provisions and has given every believer a new man to "put on" to obtain this prize. But some Christians will not avail themselves of God's provisions, calling, and warnings. The fact that believers are not "appointed" unto wrath does not mean that they will not experience it (unless we apply the wrath here to eternal torment at the Great White Throne). It is â€œappointedâ€ unto man once to die. Yet, Enoch did not die, and some died twice. Nineveh was â€œappointedâ€ to be overthrown. However, the city repented and escaped God's judgment. The Lord â€œappointedâ€ Israel to defeat the giants and obtain the promised land. Yet, almost the whole generation missed what God had graciously provided for them. Esau was â€œappointedâ€ to obtain a birthright and inheritance. Yet, he lost them. These promises to the holy Thessalonians are given to encourage them and comfort them in their persecutions. It is proper to remind God's people that God is not against them and that it is His good pleasure to give them the Kingdom, that He has made every provision, and that it is not His will for any Christian to lose his or her crown and be punished. The point of 1 Thessalonians 5 is to comfort believers and exhort them to continue WATCHING in holiness:

1 Thessalonians 5:6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

This is the same type of comforting promise that Paul gave to the Colossians:

Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 KNOWING that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

Verse 24 is very reassuring. But does it mean that EVERY believer will receive this reward? Remember how the very next verse reads:

Colossians 3:25 BUT he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

Therefore, it is very proper for believers to be reminded that they have not been appointed to endure the Tribulation period, be slain at the Judgment Seat, or miss the Millennium. They should KNOW that the Lord will reward them for their service. But they should also KNOW the TERROR of the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:9-11)!

20. Herb writes: "....him that cometh to me I will in NO WISE [No way, Jose`!] CAST OUT....that of all which he hath given me I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING, but should RAISE it up again the last day....John 6:37,39"

Herb should see that the "coming" is defined as believing in this chapter. It is discussing eternal life. The promise is qualified by the LAST DAY. This is the Great White Throne (John 12). This promise no more negates chastisement during the Millennium than it negates scourging in this life (1 Corinthians 11). I therefore fully accept the literal words of the promise and use it as one of the main proof-texts in my book! It shows that by faith alone we are only promised a resurrection unto eternal life on the Last Day.

21. Herb writes: "....I will NEVER leave thee nor forsake thee ....Hebrew 13:5"

Hebrews 13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

Since God Himself is such a rich blessing, we do not need to covet or fear MAN. Yet, the whole Epistle contains many WARNINGS about fearing GOD and His coming day of judgment! Again we call attention to this double-minded approach to Scripture. We have been told that we can ignore the warnings in Hebrews. Yet, Herb is quick to claim the sweet PROMISES in Hebrews. God will not forsake His people eternally. But He WILL JUDGE them (Hebrews 10:26-31). Furthermore, a comforting promise that God will not forsake His people in relation to their enemies should NEVER be interpreted to mean God will not JUDGE His own severely:

Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

Would anyone dare argue that GOD did not judge these people whom possessed this sweet promise (read all of 1 Corinthians 10!)? If we can be temporarily judged in this life, we may be temporarily judged on the DAY OF JUDGMENT. It is absurd to argue contrary to this fact. It is REBELLIOUS to use these promises in the manner that Herb is using them. This was the sin of Israel of old:

Jeremiah 7:4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

Many in Israel tried to use their great privileges as a reason why they could not be temporarily punished. But at the time these rebels were called FALSE PROPHETS!

22. Herb wrote: "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you UNTO MYSELF; that where I am, THERE [with Christ] ye may be also. - John 14:2,3"

Herb did not mention the previous verse which contains the CONDITION:

John 14:1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

He is talking to disciples who already believe on Him as Saviour (John 6). He is calling for them to believe upon Him as an abiding source of strength against the Devil's temptations. This promise is no more unconditional than the comforting promise Jesus gave in the next few verses:

John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
13 AND whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

This promise is NOT unconditional:

John 15:7 IF ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

Furthermore, these same disciples that are comforted in 14:1-3, are also warned of being cut off in 15:1-6!

23. Herb writes: "Yet, it is clear that Joey Faust insists that the Lord's promises of mercy and grace to believers do NOT EXTEND to the JSOC."

My book is clear that the promises of grace and mercy, in regard to eternal salvation, extend to eternity! Yet, there are other promises of grace and mercy, in regard to blessings in this life, and blessings at the Judgment Seat and the Millennium, which are CONDITIONAL. In many places, the Bible states that mercy is given to those who FEAR GOD and forgive their brethren (Psalms 33:18, 103:11, Luke 1:50, James 2:13). We should therefore not presume upon God and conclude that mercy at the Judgment Seat is automatic, without some qualifications.

24. Herb writes: "Yet Christ PROMISES NEVER to leave any born-again believer nor to forsake any born-again believer nor to cast any believer out or into hell or into the lake of fire."

There is no such statement anywhere in the Word of God. There are verses which Herb tries to INTERPRET to say this. Yet, when examined they only promise that God will raise the believer up unconditionally on the LAST DAY. They do not promise exemption from temporary scourging, either in this life, or at the Judgment Seat.

25. Herb writes: "It is not a message of Faust gloom, doom, and uncertainty. We are told to SORROW NOT."

Yet, if my view is incorrect, and Herb's view is correct, every Christian had better start examining his works in detail and doing everything in his power to endure until the end and hope that on his death-bed he can say, "I do now, after looking back over my whole life, have some confidence that I am not a false professor. But I cannot be sure until I stand before God. I may be deceiving myself about my degree of fruit-bearing." Therefore, since my view allows the verses to fully mean what they say to true Christians, it allows for absolute assurance apart from works. We know we are saved and will be raised on the Last Day REGARDLESS of our degree of fruit-bearing. We are happy, yet we are also careful and watchful, since there will be a temporary time of severe judgment coming. After years of teaching this doctrine of the terror of the Lord, we asked our fellow church members what it has done for their lives. Almost every person replied that it gave them joy and full assurance since they know the warnings to Christians refer to the MILLENNIUM and not to ETERNITY.

26. Herb writes: "And WHOSOEVER liveth and believeth in me SHALL NEVER DIE ...John 11:26."

This promise, if taken in the way Herb interprets it, would mean no believer can be slain by God in this life (1 Corinthians 11)! Yet, believers can be temporarily scourged with death in this life (the age of grace and mercy). They may certainly experience the same at the Judgment Seat (the day of reward according to works). The above promise is conditioned by the word LIVE. However, if one wishes to define "live" as positional life (instead of the daily walk of the believer, abiding in Christ), then the promise applies to the LAST DAY:

John 11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the LAST DAY.
25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?

It no more means that a believer may not perish during the Millennium than it means a believer may not perish in this life. Almost every other Scripture Herb quotes, simply promises a believer that he has eternal life and will be raised up on the LAST DAY. At other times, Herb quotes a promise that has manifest conditions and warnings in the same context!

27. Herb writes: "Whosoever is born of God doth NOT commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him; and he CANNOT sin, because he is born of God. - 1 John 3:9."

The manner in which Herb is interpreting this verse is Gnostic antinomianism at its worse! It is the very thing John is refuting! First, Herb's interpretation would not only deny that a believer could be scourged for sin at the Judgment Seat, it would also deny scourging in THIS LIFE. Yet, the NT is clear that believers can be scourged in this life for disobedience (1 Corinthians chapters 10 and 11). The phrase "born of God" does not mean, in John's 1st Epistle, what it means in the Gospel of John. John is referring in his 1st Epistle to the believer's daily WALK with God. "Born of God" is used in the same sense in which Paul uses "walk in the Spirit." The word "born" is used in 1st John in the same way the word "borne" is sometimes used. John's point is that NO ONE (saved or lost) should ever say that they are walking with God if they are not walking with God! John REFUTES the idea that God does not care about outward works. If we sin, John is arguing that GOD DID NOT PRODUCE IT. We are NOT walking in the Spirit when we sin:

1 John 3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

Therefore, Herb's use of this verse means nothing. The verse is simply saying that any believer who is in fellowship with God, will not be walking in sin:

1 John 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

Furthermore, Herb's interpretation of the verse would mean that God cannot even chastise or hold believers accountable to ANY DEGREE, at ANY TIME! Why would God take a crown away from a believer who was NOT committing any sin? Why would God withhold answered prayer from a believer who was perfect and without sin? Again, this is antinomianism gone mad! Jude warned us about this interpretation abounding among the fundamental brethren:

Jude 1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into LASCIVIOUSNESS, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
5 I will therefore put YOU in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having SAVED the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

28. Herb writes: "Follow HOLINESS...without which NO MAN shall SEE THE LORD. (Both BLESSED and HOLY, Rev. 20:6) - Heb. 12:14."

Herb is all over the place! This is my verse that proves my argument. But Herb quoted it wrong. It actually reads:

Hebrews 12:14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:

These are things which ALL believers do not do! The next verses elaborate:

Hebrews 12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

The believer that does not follow after peace and holiness, will not obtain his Millennial birthright. He will not see the Lord reigning in His Millennial glory.

29. Herb writes: "Born-again believers at the JSOC have everlasting life and are IN CHRIST. They will NEVER DIE again. They will be presented WITHOUT SPOT and WITHOUT WRINKLE and WITHOUT BLEMISH and FAULTLESS, for GOD IS ABLE to PRESENT them as such."

Herb has never been able to find any verse that teaches that some believers cannot be temporarily slain at the Judgment Seat. He has found many verses that speak of eternal salvation and resurrection on the LAST DAY. And we are thankful for them. We would have to embrace Arminianism if they were not present in the Bible. The fact that God is ABLE to present believers without spot and blemish at the Judgment Seat does not mean that every Christian will avail themselves of God's power!:

Colossians 1:22 In the body of his flesh through death, to PRESENT YOU holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
23 IF YE CONTINUE in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard...

IF only the many IF'S of Scripture were not ignored!

30. Herb writes: "Still there are no carnal Christians at the JSOC, only blood bought, blood washed, pure, faultless, uncondemned, spotless, blameless, blessed, holy, NON dying believers."

Herb is obviously unaware that he has now ruled out ANY DISTINCTIONS at the Judgment Seat. Herb may be flabbergasted at our manifestation and exposition of the Bible's numerous warnings to believers. But I must admit that I am truly amazed at this statement by Herb. Here, Herb is showing that there is no middle ground. He has backed himself into pure antinomianism in regard to a believer's walk. It was E.W. Bullinger who argued (to D.M. Panton's amazement) that "Church age" believers cannot be held accountable IN ANY DEGREE. Herb now has EVERY believer FAULTLESS before the Judgment Seat of Christ! He was forced to back himself into this position. And like David, we will waste no time finishing him off while he is down (1 Samuel 17:52). Herb has confused the Judgment Seat of Christ with the Great White Throne. He has confused positional righteousness with practical righteousness. He has confused salvation in eternity with the "well done" at the Judgment Seat! Will all believers be faultless, blameless and spotless at the Judgment Seat of Christ?! Notice how the New Testament REFUTES Herb's above statement:

1 Thessalonians 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved BLAMELESS unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Should not every pastor or church planting missionary pray the same for the flock? But is it true that EVERY believer WILL be presented blameless on that day? If so, why would Paul, or any pastor, pray for such a thing? Is Paul praying that the Thessalonians will get saved?! Are they not saved already? Notice another Scripture:

2 Peter 3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, BE DILIGENT that ye MAY be FOUND OF HIM in peace, without spot, and blameless.

If we are to be diligent that we MAY be found of Him without spot, then it follows that SOME believers will appear less than perfect when He appears. The various parables of our Lord make this clear, as well as numerous Scriptures in the Epistles.

31. Herb writes: "Believers' souls will be without sin at the judgment seat of Christ. Their sins - past, present, and future - are forgiven and are paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ."

Mr. Evans offers no Scripture to back up the assumption that believer's souls will be without sin at the Judgment seat. It is a transitional, parenthetical event. The vain excuses of the unprofitable servant imply otherwise. Nevertheless, believers will not be tried and judged at the Judgment Seat for sins they are committing on that day. They are standing trial for the things done in the body when they lived on earth (2 Corinthians 5:9-11). Every sin in a believer is paid for as far as eternity is concerned. Yet, as far as daily fellowship, answered prayer, and Millennial rewards, these blessings may be forfeited by sin! Forgiveness is conditioned upon things such as confession (1 John 1:9-10), and showing mercy to others (Matthew 6:12).

32. Herb writes: "As far as God is concerned, the believer's new nature does not sin and CANNOT sin (1 John 3:9)."

What mystical mumbo-jumbo! It is not the "new nature" that will be standing trial at the Judgment Seat! The CHRISTIAN will be standing trial to reveal the degree that he availed himself of the new nature!:

Ephesians 4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
24 And THAT YE PUT ON THE NEW MAN, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.

Colossians 3:12 PUT ON therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

The â€œnew manâ€ is already perfect and doesnâ€™t need to â€œput onâ€ anything. The unbeliever certainly does not have the â€œnew manâ€ available to â€œput on.â€ Whoever it is that is called to put on the new man is the one who will stand trial at the Judgment Seat. But Herb has the NEW MAN standing trial at the Judgment Seat! How convenient! No wonder Herb thinks everyone will receive prizes! He has no Judgment Seat at all. He has a rewards ceremony where all the â€œnew menâ€ and â€œnew naturesâ€ get praised! The Christian that will not PUT ON this new man daily, and will not confess and repent as much as he has light to do so, will RECEIVE for the wrong that he has done at the Judgment Seat. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord (we have seen it displayed in almost every book of the Bible) we persuade men!

33. Herb writes: "Php 1:6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"

We certainly agree with this verse. But the promise is conditioned upon the believer WORKING OUT what God wills to work IN:

Philippians 2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, WORK OUT your own salvation with fear and TREMBLING.
13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
15 That ye may be BLAMELESS and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
16 Holding forth the word of life; that I MAY rejoice in the DAY OF CHRIST, that I have not run in vain, neither LABOURED IN VAIN.

We are to serve God with a fear that brings TREMBLING. Herbâ€™s teaching on the Judgment Seat is a joke. It makes no one tremble. It is incredible what reading ahead a chapter will do for us. It is true that God works in us; and we may rest in this fact. Yet, we are warned that we must not sit and wait on God, blaming Him for our failures in the Christian walk. We are told to work out what He works in. But all believers do not do this. Therefore, all believers will not be blameless on the day of Christ Jesus. Paul exhorts the believers to hold fast that he MAY rejoice in their crowns. According to Herb's Gnostic, antinomian views, the word "blameless" in verse 15 is out of place! How in the world can believers who are perfect and sinless, and can never be held accountable, be told that they should strive to be BLAMELESS? Isn't this redundant? It is not, when we realize that there is more than just positional truth concerning New Testament believers. Herb's denial of accountability is very similar to the rebellious Israelite's denial in the OT:

Malachi 2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

34. Herb writes: "Joey, like a Jehovah's Witness, messes with 'eternal life,' using the above circular argument in order to make his false doctrine work."

If Herb would have read more than just the first paragraph of the chapter he would see that my first and foremost argument is based upon the most common definition of "eternal." Eternal life is sometimes set before believers as a reward. This is what my chapter proves. I then show that there is no reason to limit this word in these reward passages. I show that the Holy Spirit is promising overcoming, faithful believers that they will be raised never to die again BEFORE the Millennium. Unfaithful believers will be raised to be judged, but will return to death in their bodies (until the Great White Throne). Therefore, these unfaithful believers do not EXPERIENCE "eternal life" until AFTER the Millennium. My book also documents from many Bible and English dictionaries and scholars throughout history, that the word "can" have a sometimes limited meaning. This argument is not necessary to my view in any degree. I simply offer it to the reader as alternative, since it was the view of S.S. Craig, a fiery, premillennial fundamentalist in 1916. He believed that "eternal life" could mean either "life in endless eternity," or "life during the Millennium." In other words, he defined it as "age-lasting life." The J.W. denies torment for unfaithful Christians during the Millennium, and he denies any torment for unbelievers throughout eternity. The view of S.S. Craig (though he AT TIMES limits the word "eternal," like almost every Christian scholar before 1930), is so far from the J.W. view, that it not only has unbelievers suffering in torment for all eternity, but it has God's unfaithful people suffering 1000 years! If Craig is a "J.W." for limiting the word "eternal" in certain contexts, then Herb is a "J.W." for denying that a believer can be punished during the Millennium! The â€œno hellersâ€ would be proud of Herb.

35. Herb writes: "Although he claims to be a King James Bible Believer, he likes to mess with the Greek to gainsay the plain English concerning 'eternal,' 'everlasting,' 'never,' and 'ever.'"

Here Herb tells a nasty lie. There is not ONE TIME that I appeal to the Greek or Hebrew. I may quote a Bible dictionary or certain authors who appealed to the Greek as PART of their argument. Yet, I make my secondary argument fully on the English Bible and a list of rare English dictionaries. I believe the King James Bible is without error. Therefore, Herb is simply trying to refute a book he has only glanced at. Notice he provided no documentation, but uses this as a way to bolster his argument and scare â€œKJV Onlyistsâ€ away from my book. Herb doesnâ€™t realize that our church was listed in the newspaper in Dallas as one of the first church web sites on the Internet, back when it began. At the time, we were â€œRefuge King James Bible Church,â€ and we had many articles on both KJV Onlyism AND Millennial exclusion, etc. Most KJV Onlyists therefore are familiar with my views. From the very start of the Internet movement, David Cloud has listed our church in his directory with the disclaimer, â€œBelieves partial rapture and disobedient Christians must spend 1000 years in Hell.â€ Herbâ€™s audience is only one narrow branch of the KJV Only movement. And most of these men were already aware of my position, years ago. My E-mail and postal letter correspondence with most of them over the years, proves this to be so. Many of the brethren voiced his objections with me years before I ever wrote my book. My book is an ANSWER to these shallow objections. This is why I take Herb to task for simply reading the first sentence of various chapters of my book, and then wasting my time with his â€œobjections,â€ as if he is giving us something new. Let him digest my answers and then refute THEM. He would then be adding something fresh to the controversy.

36. Herb writes: "Faust likewise searches for places in which 'eternal' does not mean 'eternal,' 'never' does not mean 'never,' and so forth, so that his NON continuous eternal life can cease at the JSOC, where Faust has God killing and burning the carnal Christian after He 'raises' him to heaven."

Herb fails to mention that this is only a secondary argument and that my position is not dependent upon the relative nature of these words. Yet, since certain words are sometimes used in a relative fashion, I throw out the possibility as ANOTHER secondary manner of interpreting the warnings to believers. Such words are interpreted by the AGE they are meant to represent. If the age is this lifetime, "for ever" would mean throughout the life. If the AGE is the Millennium, it might mean throughout 1000 years. If the AGE is eternity, the words would mean throughout infinity. This is reasonable, and there is much to commend the view. Yet, I only use the view in an appendix, and my view is not dependent on the sometimes relative nature of these words.

37. Herb writes: "....Faust now puts such eternal life indiscretions in the appendix." I shortened almost all the chapters to make the book easier to read. Yet Herb is still having some trouble with it.

38. Herb writes: "The eternal life, which truly saved Christians have, is NOT a REWARD (presented neither to them at the JSOC nor after the millennium) as Joey teaches."

Herb offers no Scripture proofs. He does not deal with a single proof-text I offer to show that "eternal life" IS sometimes offered as a reward for good works. The reader is supposed to believe Herb's statement is true because Herb says it is true. John Bunyan, Jack Hyles, and others, have toyed with the idea that either â€œeverlasting lifeâ€ or â€œeternal life,â€ in some contexts, refers to a reward for holy living. I show that fundamentalist S.S. Craig (look him up on the Internet) had the best argument, and that it fits with Scripture, and the views of Pember, Govett, Nee, Tilney, etc.

39. Herb writes: "2 Co 4:14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."

Yes, as Paul explains in the very next chapter, all Christians will be RAISED to stand trial in the body, and some may then experience the TERROR of the Lord:

2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

40. Herb writes: "Joey SPINS some believers as only being 'raised' but NOT really being 'resurrected.'"

And Herb only restates what I maintain. He does not refute it with any proof-texts or reasonings. The reader is to believe that Joey Faust is wrong because Herb says that he is wrong. Paul plainly states that all believers will be RAISED before the Millennium. But "having part" in the First Resurrection is MORE than being raised to judgment. It is being raised, never to die again, to rule and reign with Christ:

Luke 20:35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
36 Neither can they DIE ANY MORE: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.

Paul labored to be found worthy of this resurrection (the prize of remaining alive at the Judgment Seat to reign with Christ):

Philippians 3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
11 IF BY ANY MEANS I might attain unto the RESURRECTION of the dead.

Paul teaches the same thing in 2 Corinthians 5, which we have already quoted:

2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore WE LABOUR, that, whether present or absent, WE MAY BE ACCEPTED of him.
10 FOR we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
11 Knowing therefore the TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

Paul wanted to be accepted on the day of judgment. He did not want to experience the TERROR of the Lord. He did not want to die again (a second death). He wanted to "have part" in the FIRST RESURRECTION (i.e. he wanted to rule with Christ 1000 years):

Revelation 20:6 Blessed and HOLY is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

Unfaithful Christians will be raised. At the Judgment Seat, they may experience the terror of the Lord and die again, being TEMPORARILY hurt of the second death:

Revelation 2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

41. Herb writes: "Joey, a split rapturist (careful not to use the words 'raised' and 'translated,' instead of 'raptured' or 'resurrected,') believes the carnal will eventua

43. Herb writes: "And, behold, I come quickly; and my REWARD is with me, to give EVERY MAN according as his WORK shall be. - Rev. 22:12."

It appears that Herb quotes this verse as a proof-text. If so, now we have Herb applying a verse in Revelation 22 to a Christian in this dispensation. We have already seen him apply promises in the Gospels, as well as promises from Hebrews. Therefore, it is clearly manifested that Herb picks and chooses what he wishes to apply to the Christian according to whether or not he likes the promise! If it sounds nice, Herb applies it to Christians. If it is a strong warning, Herb ignores it or attempts to wiggle out from under it. A few sentenc

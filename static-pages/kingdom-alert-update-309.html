2. THANKSGIVING (2008): THE CURSE OF COMMUNISM! 

BOOK REVIEW: "WORLDLY AMUSEMENTS" by Wayne A. Wilson (1999).
This author, in a few places, appears to criticize early Fundamentalists for condemning Hollywood movies without viewing them. Yet, in other places he shows the vanity of "movie reviewers" continuing to swim in filth and expecting to have discernment. He tries too hard to find something redeeming in early Hollywood. But his arguments against those who want to "engage the culture" are worthy enough that they end up correcting any weaknesses in the book. The book ends strong enough to be commended in this compromising generation. It is strong enough to either make this generation of "Bible believers" red in their faces with convicted anger, or else cause them to get down on their faces before God in repentance. 
The author gives a devastating blow to the antichrist position of Franky Schaeffer's, "Sham Pearls for Real Swine." Schaeffer adopts the modern "worldly Christian" view that almost anything is acceptable for viewing (gore, fornication, profanity, etc.) as long as you call it "art." Wilson exposes some of the filth and immorality in what some have foolishly described as the "glory days of the church." For example, one king had his mistress pose in lewdness as "Mary" with infant "Jesus." When "Christians" viewed the "art" they were seeing the king's mistress. He shows this type of "behind the scenes" humor has always been prevalent. [This same, "winking" mockery of Christians and holiness is found in movies today (as when Mel Gibson had his "star" exposed, according to reviewers of movie, "The Passion of the Christ".]

Wilson gives some excellent documentation to show that if you will embrace the theater today, you will have to go against almost every Christian in every age of past history. (And therefore you will have to believe that "in the last days, FUN times shall come" since Christians will be so enlightened!). 

The author provides a well-reasoned section on the differences between text and film. There is a difference. He rebukes the idea that if you can find violence or "love" in the Bible, then it must be fitting to act it out and view it all, up close, on the screen! Do people really believe their own justifications for waddling in sleaze and gore? I do not think so. 

He shows the folly of relying on Hollywood's rating system (the content of modern PG movies was seen in pornographic literature in the 1950s). Here are some excerpts from this book:

"...this is, I believe, the first generation of Bible-believing Christians ever to have embraced evil amusements so completely."

"The most well-known Christian singer in America lends her talents to the very R-rated movie The Postman..."

"Last year church leaders across the land encouraged their flocks and youth groups to see Titanic, a film that glorified teenage [fornication]...simply because the film (unfairly) condemned the rich."

"We want to enjoy nearly everything the world enjoys but with Jesus added on as Savior." 
 
THANKSGIVING (2008): THE CURSE OF COMMUNISM! 

TEXT: Ephesians 3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named...
The family is a foundational doctrine. We know it is being perverted in these last days. There are many "isms" that want to destroy the family, so that they can conform the impressionable minds of the children to their agenda. 

The family in this verse in Ephesians is the family of God. This means everyone who is born again; everyone who accepts Jesus as Saviour (not of works):

Galatians 6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 

Just as we need to contend for the Biblical definition of the nuclear family; we also need to contend against those who would redefine the family of faith! Evil men and seducers want you to believe that everyone is one big family of God! 

Anyone who properly believes in Jesus is my spiritual brother, regardless of nationality or race or economic status. But no one is my spiritual brother who believes in salvation by works, or who trusts in some other savior than Jesus.

For over 100 years there has been an aggressive push to break down religious barriers - to unite all religions. Therefore, fundamentalism has become the great evil - ridiculed by everyone from Jimmy Carter, to Rick Warren and the Pope! They call us to be "Global citizens." Carter, when he was President, said we are "a beloved community." 

A New World Order is coming (in many ways it is here), where everyone is equalized into a Universal Communist system, where the state and religion merge together. If you oppose it, you are "hate-filled" and "unpatriotic." 

For this Worldwide Communist Utopia to be established, two barriers must be overcome:
1. The barrier of the traditional family. 
2. The barrier of the Christian family of God.

These two family barriers must be broken down and redefined. Why?

The family is a major institution through which the Biblical teachings and traditions are communicated from generation to generation. For the same reason, the family of God (and its local churches) must be redefined and reorganized. (But God warns against defiling the temple of God!)

To accomplish this breakdown of the two families, they demonize the old paths as "patriarchy." Then they lead away "silly women" to rebel against the old ways. Chaos results. Divide and Conquer. In the anarchy that follows, they come in and promise to fix it all with a "new way," a "new deal"; they promise, "a new covenant" (Bill Clinton) or "change" (Obama):

Proverbs 24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change: 

2 Peter 2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption...

Notice all the religious language, perverted by politicians. They use the Good Samaritan, the Sermon on the Mount, etc. (at other times they mock the Scriptures, like Obama). Jesus says "give," and, as foxes, they define this to mean that you must vote for the government to take people's money and redistribute it to the drug users and prostitutes, so they won't have any incentive to change their ways. The Bible teaches that pastors and teachers must reprove false prophets. The fact that a false prophet is a politician does not grant him immunity from Biblical reproof - especially when he misquotes the Bible and attempts to seduce the simpleminded. 

As Thanksgiving Day approaches, we are in living in the midst of the largest attempt to reorder society along the old Communist lines that we have ever experienced. The old New Deal was just kid's play. It is ironic that it occurs in 2008. "Eight" is the number of newness or change (not always for the better).
As Thanksgiving Day (2008) approaches, we should consider the blessings of the Old America, and notice that American Communists are applauding the ushering in of a "New America":American Communists Rejoice in Obama:

"Statement of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA at its November 15-16th 2008 meeting...'We hail the 10â€™s of millions who came to the polls and registered an historic defeat of the ultra right. These voters saw through the direct and indirect appeals to racism and voted for Obama. We salute those who rejected the Republican anti-communist, anti-immigrant attacks and numerous other slanders and voted their hopes and not their fears. Their votes represent the highest expression of patriotism. "

Many people are asleep, and they do not realize that what these politicians applaud as "change" is actually the OLD, unbiblical philosophies and goals of Marx and Engels:

Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848):
"Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists...we replace home education by social...[We] desire...an openly legalized system of free love...[We seek:] Abolition of property...A heavy progressive or graduated income tax...Abolition of all rights of inheritance...Centralization of credit in the banks of the state, by means of a national bank...Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state...Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state...gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country...Free education for all children in public schools..."

This philosophy ultimately brings a curse wherever it is found. To understand the foundation of the blessings that God has given to America, we must go back to the FIRST THANKSGIVING.
 
Thanksgiving Day (1623):
Did you know that the first, historic Thanksgiving was actually a celebration of gratitude to God for saving the Pilgrims from the consequences of Communism? How ironic. 
The Pilgrims fled the Old World to escape religious persecution. They landed in the New World in 1620. But they had formed a contract with London merchants in order to come to the New World. The contract included a stipulation that the new colony must be organized in a Communistic manner:
"That all such persons as are of this colony, are to have their meat, drink, apparel, and all provision out of ye common stock & goods of ye said colony."
(Contract with the Pilgrims) 

Food was distributed equally to everyone. The women washed clothes and cooked for everyone. This brought confusion to the institution of the family (as Communism always does). 

This experiment in Communism almost killed everyone by starvation! Therefore, the Pilgrims abandoned Communism and established the system of individual enterprise; self-reliance, etc.

Why did this early Communist experiment fail? The Pilgrims wrote that it produces laziness and resentment. It destroys incentive. Failure is rewarded. 

I recently heard some business men call into a radio station one night while traveling, and they were all talking about how they were about to downsize, lay off workers, etc. They argued that they did not want to be the people who are forced to provide for everyone else! This is what happens when taxes are radically raised to punish success. 

After abandoning Communism, Gov. Bradford wrote:

"This had very good success for it made all hands industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been."
(Bradford's Journal) 

They were so prosperous after adopting the new system of self-reliance, that they celebrated with a day of Thanksgiving!:

"By this time harvest was come, and in stead of famine now God gave them plenty, and ye face of things was changed, to ye rejoicing of ye hearts of many, for which they blessed God."
(Bradford's Journal)

"The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years, and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince, the vanity of that conceit of Plato & others ancients, applauded by some of later times; that ye taking away of property, and bringing in community into a common wealth, would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God. For this community...was found to breed much confusion & discontent, and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort..."
(Bradford's Journal) 

Foolish people walk in the way that seems right to man apart from God. Foolish people think they can simply "talk" to children and they will turn out alright. They think they can tax everyone to the sky, and that this will not affect how hard people work; it will not destroy morale, incentive and investment. Of course, this is nonsense, and it has been proven again and again. But the simple-minded continue to fall for it, as they curse their future. 

In spite of some initial prosperity, God still showed the Pilgrims that they were dependent upon Him. They still had to humble themselves before God and pray for good weather. In all labor there is profit. When we are not slothful, and we plow and sow, there will be blessings. But only when God mercifully gives the increase! Free enterprise without God will not bring fullness of blessing:

Deuteronomy 8:11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
13 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
14 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God...
17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.
18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth... 

This is where America went wrong. We do not need to abandon free enterprise. We do not need Fascism. We simply need to repent and be thankful, and remember God as we work. Government would be wise to get back to the proper role that it was assigned in the American Constitution. America was not founded to be an Oligarchy (rule by few), or an Anarchy (no law). It was founded to be a Republic; that is, a nation ruled by righteous law.

In light of the misapplication of Scripture from many politicians (false prophets), it is important to notice that the Bible is against Communism:

The Bible Against Communism:

Exodus 23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:
3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause. 

Leviticus 19:15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

Notice that the "poor man" is not to be given special favor, so that he may use the state to steal from the rich. This is unjust. And injustice is not sanctioned by the Bible.

It is true that the Bible also often condemns bending justice for the sake of the rich. However, we do not fix this situation by pretending to eradicate the rich and the poor. The poor are simply used to reshuffle the deck and bring to power new people.

The Apostle Paul teaches that people should not be forced to be charitable by civil law: 
Philemon 1:14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

Paul would not take Philemon's servant as his helper - even though Philemon owed Paul his life. Paul uses lots of moral persuasion; but he does not force by civil law or threat. 

Pastor Timothy was told to charge the rich men to invest in the Judgment Seat! The prophets in the OT exhorted and warned men to bring in their tithes and offerings. The NT repeated the OT exhortations to support the church and give to the poor. But it always used moral compulsion. There is no whip, no jail, no civil penalty. It leaves a man to God. 

All of the Biblical commands to give (especially the ones about giving to the poor), are redefined by Communists, Socialists, and Liberals to mean that you approve of the state being involved in a "social Gospel," where giving to the poor is mandated by taxes in excessive ways. 

The New Testament teaches a holy form of self-reliance:

2 Thessalonians 3:10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.

Ephesians 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.

There is no state mandate to give alms. It is to be done willingly, in light of God's promises and warnings. 

What about the Book of Acts?:

Acts 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 

Acts 4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
35 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.

This "communion" was all voluntary! There was no legal compulsion. It was not mandated. 

The situation called for it, and the Christians FREELY responded to the need. Thousands of Jews that had previously lived abroad, in other lands, have now become Christians. They are all now in one place. They must be provided for. 

Also, new Christians were taught the teachings of Jesus. What did Jesus teach? He had warned that in one generation, Jerusalem would be devastated. This likely provided an extra motivation to step up to the plate and be a blessing to the new Christians in need of provision.

The Apostle Peter clearly reveals that this communal giving of the early Christians was not state mandated, or even compelled by man. Many Christians retained houses (as we see throughout Acts). Notice the words of Peter:

Acts 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.

            "For us, murder is once for all forbidden....It makes no difference whether one take away the life once born, or destroy it as it comes to birth. He is a man, who is to be a man; the fruit is always present in the seed." (Tertullian)

Luke 1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped IN her WOMB: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:

Job 31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us IN the WOMB?

Psalms 139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me IN my mother's WOMB.

Isaiah 49:15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? YEA, they may forget...

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be...
3 Without NATURAL AFFECTION...

A recent new article calls attention to an alarming number of abortions committed by women who profess to be born-again:

"A study published by an affiliate of Planned Parenthood says almost a quarter-million abortions are performed each year in the U.S. on women who identify themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians. Approximately 1.37 million abortions are performed in the United States each year. According to a startling and little publicized survey by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 37.4% of those abortions are performed on Protestant women - approximately one-half (about 18%) of whom profess to be born-again believers." (AgapePress, July 11, 2001)

The writers of the above report did not cite which survey or article the above statistics were derived from. However, AGI's web site does contain the following information:

"Catholic women have an abortion rate 29% higher than Protestant women...one in five women having abortions are born-again or Evangelical Christians..." ("Abortion Common Among All Women," 1996 New Release, AGI)

"The results of the 1995 survey show that the women who are most likely to obtain an abortion have an annual income of less than $15,000, are enrolled in Medicaid, are aged 18-24, are nonwhite or Hispanic, are separated or never-married, live with a partner outside marriage and have no religious affiliation. Catholics are as likely as the general population of women to terminate a pregnancy, Protestants are less likely to do so, and Evangelical Christians are the least likely to do so." (The
Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1997)

Another pro-choice (pro baby-murder) web site reports:

"One-sixth of abortion patients describe themselves as born-again or Evangelical Christians; while 25% of U.S. women are Catholic, nearly one third of abortion patients say they are Catholics." (Pro-choice.org, "Women Who Have Abortions - Fact Sheet," 1996)

We would expect most abortions to be committed by lost people who do not claim to be a "Christian" at all. Then, we would expect Catholics to be the next in line, followed by Protestants. Both of these two groups of professing Christians believe in sprinkling infants, baptismal regeneration, salvation by grace through "faith-works" (i.e. faithfulness), a non-literal approach to Bible interpretation, etc. The report states that the next group in line behind Protestants are "Evangelical" or "born-again" Christians. It would be interesting to have further information on these Evangelicals. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that they understand the Gospel and sincerely believe it, are they faithful members of a local church? The Holy Ghost teaches that faithfully assembling with the saints is a key to resisting sin:

Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the ASSEMBLING of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
26 For if we SIN wilfully...

It is obvious that Paul is linking neglecting church attendance with the danger of falling into sin. To resist the wiles of the Devil, we must put on "the breastplate of righteousness" (Eph.6:14). It is not "righteous" to
forsake church attendance!

Then I would like to ask, of the women who are faithful members of an "Evangelical" church, how many of these are churches that place an emphasis on soul winning? How many have weekly ministries to help insure that church members are obeying the first, central command Christ gave after His resurrection (Mt.28:19, 20)? Can we truly have on the "breastplate of righteousness" if we are not regularly obeying the Great Commission? Christians who do not witness, certainly do not have their "feet shod [i.e. shoed] with the preparation of the gospel of peace"
(Eph.6:15). It is obvious that Christians who lack such armor will live carnal lives (assuming they are truly saved). Furthermore, how many of these women are active members of a soul-winning, fundamental, God-fearing
church that regularly calls abortion "child murder" from the pulpit? It appears that many sermons today are either emotional pep rallies with no substance, or they are dry lectures on everything under the sun other than what God requires of New Testament saints! I think we need to get back to simple preaching to Christians:

I. Here is what God says to do
II. You should do it because:
1. God commanded it - and that should be the end of it
2. He gives you the power to do it
3. You should love Him in gratitude by obedience since He saved you by grace through faith alone and you can't lose it
4. Jesus is coming back soon to judge whether you did it
A. He'll reward you for obedience
B. He'll punish you dreadfully for disobedience
5. [Assuming it is a large enough sin] you'll be disfellowshipped from church and delivered over to the Devil for disobedience

There was once a day when going to church (regardless of the denomination!) meant hearing a sermon against some sin and hearing of the severe consequences such sin will bring upon the head of the sinner. There is more to Christianity. Modern "scholars" may despise such simplicity and think that they have more to offer. But we better get back to some old-fashioned, simple basics! We expect Catholics to head the abortion list among professing Christians. They have a "form of godliness" but deny the power thereof. But God-forbid if it could ever be proven that a significant number of saved, fundamental Baptist ladies are guilty of the sin of child murder! If we do not regularly PREACH (not just "teach") that such sins are wrong and will bring severe judgment (to saint or sinner), we ought to sit down and let somebody else give the weekly sermon.

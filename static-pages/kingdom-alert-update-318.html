REVIEW AND RESPONSE TO CHUCK AND NANCY MISSLER'S, "THE KINGDOM, POWER &amp; GLORY: THE OVERCOMER'S HANDBOOK (REVISED)" (PART 3)

This book was first published in 2007, but was recently revised in October, 2009. This is the 3rd part of my response to it:

MISSLER: "...what we do after we have been born again dramatically affects our roles, our positions, and our places in the future reign of Christ. This coming kingdom is not heaven, but a literal kingdom that will exist back on earth for a thousand years..."
(Chapter 3, p. 55)

This is a certainly true! We simply need to add that how we lie also affects whether we enter this kingdom (Matthew 5:19-23, Luke 18:24, Acts 14:22, Hebrews 4:11, Revelation 22:14, etc.).

MISSLER: "All believers will be with Christ in the coming Millennium, but only the overcomers...will inherit levels of responsibility..."
(Chapter 3, p. 55)

The word overcome, used in the context of rewards, is found primarily in the Lord's words to the Seven Churches in the Book of Revelation, chapters 2 and 3. Let us therefore test this view that all believers enter the kingdom. Missler's book is subtitled, The Overcomer's Handbook. When examining the Bible verses concerning the overcomers, we should be able to find this doctrine of all believers entering the kingdom. However, when we actually study the Scriptures pertaining to overcoming, this idea that all believers will enter the kingdom is not found. As we have seen, the Lord in Matthew 5:19 teaches that the highest positions in the Millennium will be given to those who not only obey and teach the greatest of the commandments, but also give diligent attention to the least of the Lord's commandments. Those who commit sins worthy of death, and do not repent, will be excluded from the Millennium:

Deuteronomy 21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death...

1 John 5:17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

1 Corinthians 6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

This teaching is confirmed in the Book of Revelation in the various promises to overcomers:

Revelation 2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

We cannot pick and choose which of these promises we want to literally apply to the saints. Verse 11 is just as true as verse 26. Missler's book is based on verse 26: If Christians overcome, they will have power over the nations (i.e. they will reign with Christ). Missler rightly believes that those who do not overcome will not reign with Christ. I have shown elsewhere that every believer who is granted entrance into the kingdom will reign to some degree (some high and some lower - but all reign - see Revelation 5:10, 17:14, 20:6, etc.). But putting aside this point for the moment, Missler rightly understands that whoever does not overcome in Revelation 2:26 will not have power over the nations. But what gives Brother Missler the right to interpret Revelation 2:11 in a different manner? According to Jesus, whoever does not overcome will be hurt of the second death! Therefore, not having power over the nations includes being hurt of the second death. The first death occurs when the body and the spirit/soul are separated (James 2:26). Later, the body and spirit are brought together again to stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ. Believers will be raised to stand before the Lord before the kingdom. Believers who are not overcomers will be slain. And this will be the second death. When unbelievers are raised to stand before the Great White Throne, after the Millennium, they will experience a second death in the Lake of Fire that will endure forever. Since unbelievers will not be raised before the Millennium, this will be the second time their bodies and spirits are united. When they die, they will experience the second death. But believers who do not overcome, who are raised before the Millennium, will experience a second death that endures only for the duration of the Millennium:

Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

There is no way to escape this conclusion without undermining the whole foundation of Missler's overcomer theology. His overcomer viewpoint is correct in its foundations. It is the only system of interpretation that fully guards the grace of God against Romanism and Arminianism. However, we must be consistent with these overcomer promises. It would nonsensical to apply Revelation 2:26 literally to believers, and then interpret Revelation 2:11 in a different manner - simply because we do not like the warning. Who are we to pass judgment on the penalties for our offenses? Shall the thief judge the jury? Do not men become infidels by using their emotions to judge the doctrine of eternal judgment? If we expect unbelievers to face up to their own warnings, should not believers do the same? The coming judgment begins with the house of God!

We therefore find, when examining the overcomer promises and warnings, that Missler's view is immediately disproved. All believers do not enter the coming Kingdom. How can a believer be hurt of the second death and yet enter the Kingdom? But while we are at it, let's examine some other overcomer promises:

Revelation 2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

Here is one that modern preachers will gladly embrace. It is politically correct enough to preach in this psychological age that will not endure sound doctrine concerning the fear of God. There are few preachers that will be so humanistic that they will imply that all believers will gain the rewards mentioned in verse 17. They rightly see that this is a promise for overcomers. It therefore is also a warning for the non-overcomers. But if we will apply this promise literally to the saints, we must apply all of the promises that are in the same context:

Revelation 3:5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

The Word of God now binds the commentators hand and foot. There is no way out. Immediately, two of these promises are readily embraced by Christian many preachers. For example, Missler rightly understands that the above promises are for overcomers. Jesus teaches that only the overcomers will be clothed in white raiment! The believers who do not overcome will not be clothed in white. They will be ashamed. They will be naked. Jesus makes this clear in the previous verse, and elsewhere:

Revelation 3:4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

Can words be any clearer? Only those believes who overcome, and keep the Lord works until the end, will be clothed in white. Notice:

Revelation 3:18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

Jesus is plainly teaching this pastor and church of Laodicea that it is possible to appear in shame and nakedness at the Judgment Seat of Christ:

Revelation 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

Again, if words mean anything, many believers will not be clothed in white at the Lord's appearing:

1 John 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

But let us now see who will descend with Jesus after the Judgment Seat of Christ, to reign in the Kingdom:

Revelation 19:8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

Only the faithful, overcoming believers will adorn this city during the Millennium. Notice that everyone who descends with the Lord is clothed in white! This white, fine linen was won by the practical righteousness of the saints! It is gained by overcoming! But where are the "many" that will not be clothed in white? They are not present. All who descend with Jesus are faithful and chosen and holy. They are all clothed in white:

Revelation 17:14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

Revelation 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

Notice that all will reign who have part in the First Resurrection. They are not only blessed, but holy! They are faithful and chosen. Where are those who supposedly gain entrance into the Kingdom, but do not reign?

Now let's go back to Revelation 3:5:

Revelation 3:5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

The last promise to the overcomers in this verse is that they will be confessed before the Father and the angels. Jesus teaches this promise elsewhere:

Luke 12:7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
9 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

Notice that Jesus teaches that those who do confess Him, will be confessed before the angels. To consistently confess Him before men, in this world, one must be an overcomer. It will take effort, and often much suffering. Jesus reveals that His promises in the Book of Revelation are also implied warnings. In Luke 12:9, He plainly shows that whoever does not confess Him, will be denied before the angels. This closes the door on the popular interpretation of the overcomer warnings by many commentators. They argue that when Jesus promises something to an overcomer, He does not "really" mean that they must overcome to receive it! In other words, they would argue that when Jesus says that they who overcome will be confessed before the Father and the angels, that this does not imply that those who do not overcome will be denied. Aside from the obvious absurdity of this view (as well as the mess it will make of the rest of Scripture), the whole idea is firmly reproved by Jesus by comparing Luke 12:8-9 with Revelation 3:5. Those who do not overcome, who do not confess the Lord, will be denied! They will not be confessed (i.e. honored) before God:

Luke 9:20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;
22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

These words addressed to Peter, and his brethren, teach that the duty of confessing Jesus includes confessing His words without shame before this adulterous and sinful generation (Mark 8:38). His words include His many warnings!

Now once again, notice the final warning in the midst of Revelation 3:5:

Revelation 3:5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

The Lord in this verse teaches that the non-overcomer will be blotted out of the Book of Life. This means he will experience death. He will be denied entrance into the Kingdom during the Millennium. He will be hurt of the second death (but not eternally). Missler's theory (adopted from Brother Joseph Dillow) is disproved. There are no believers from this age who gain entrance into the Kingdom who are not overcomers. There are no believers from this age who enter the Kingdom but do not reign. Many believers will not only be denied he reign, they will be denied entrance into the Kingdom. They will be blotted out of the Book of Life. But they will be restored to life at the end of the Millennium, on the last day.

There are perhaps a few more things to notice in this book. But for now, we will skip and conclude with Chapter 12, which is titled, What is an Overcomer? Missler calls this one of the most important chapters. Missler writes:

"Learning to be an overcomer, therefore, is absolutely essential to our Christian walk. Otherwise, why would God emphasize overcoming as the key to inheriting His kingdom? (See Revelation 2 and 3)."
(Chapter 12, p. 223)

This is true. However, many of these overcomer promises, as we have seen, undercut as major teaching in this book (i.e. that all believers will enter the Kingdom, and that there s no death to fear at the Judgment Seat of Christ).

Missler writes:

"...many Christians have been taught that if we are believers, we are automatically overcomers. The Scripture used as proof text is 1 John 5:4...Positionally it's absolutely true that we are overcomers the moment we believe...But experimentally...how many of us are actually overcoming in our everyday lives?"

Amen!

Missler writes:

"And how are we supposed to gain the blessings that Revelation 2 and 3 talk about?...Being an overcomer is God's will for every believer (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26, 3:5, 12, 21; 21:7)..."

Missler interestingly (and rightly!) applies everyone of these overcomer promises/warnings to believers in Revelation 2 and 3. But, as we have seen, these warnings teach that many believers will suffer death and the Judgment Seat of Christ.

This book is far beyond most of popular, commercial Christianity. This is certainly commendable. Popular Christianity is a strange, contradictory mixture of works salvation (i.e. pleasing the Mormons and Catholics, etc.), and antinomianism (i.e. do whatever you please, there is nothing to lose of fear). What a different state of things we would have, if the fundamental preachers of America would be willing to go as far as Missler. However, the truth is the truth, and this attempt to water down the warnings to believers must be reproved. The Lord knows we often need the fullness of these warnings to overcome the pleasures and appeal of this sinful world.

There is no room for leaning to our own understanding here. We have a responsibility to proclaim the Lord's warnings to His people, without alteration or apology! It is time for real men to step up to the plate and quit whimpering in the corner. Christian families are being destroyed that could be saved if men of God would open their mouths and preach what Jesus calls them to preach, instead of preaching what their "Baptist club" authorizes them to preach. Too many are settled on their lees, but one day soon we will all be on our knees, confessing Jesus as Lord. Will He confess us as faithful on that day?

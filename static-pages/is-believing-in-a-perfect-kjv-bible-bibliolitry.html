            IS BELIEVING IN A PERFECT (KJV) BIBLE "BIBLIOLITRY"?

In response to such an accusation, I would simply ask that one show me where we are not supposed to worship the Bible. Of course, these people will immediately turn to a "Bible" verse against idolatry. Do they believe this command as written? It is found in a BIBLE. Is it a true, "certain" reflection of God's will? Can they say that they know PERFECTLY that it is God's will that His people refrain from idolatry? I have one question: Don't you think it is dangerous to say you know for SURE that God does not desire us to commit idolatry? I mean, will you not be tempted to worship this knowledge since you know for sure it is God's will?

It is indeed absurd to try to prove from a supposedly imperfect Bible something you pretend to know "for sure" from that Bible! But let's take it further. Those that believe that there are mistakes or copy errors (yes we know, you think these are only about 3% and that they do not harm anything "really" important) believe there are some parts they can be absolutely sure about. Certainly they would claim there is SOMETHING within 66 Books which they believe is a perfect Revelation of God's will. Now why is it they do not worship this "something"? Is not this idolatry, to hold to some part as being a certain revelation from God? See, the only difference between us and them in regard to this issue is one: We believe the WHOLE thing is perfect and they believe only some PART of it is perfect:
<blockquote>"Before taking the discussion further, I should pause and set at rest the troubled concern of anyone who, on the basis of what I have written so far, concludes that the manuscript tradition is entirely unreliable, OR THAT WE CAN NOT REALLY BE CERTAIN OF ANY OF IT....The result, as I shall try to show, is a certan word from God...the vast majority of the lines of the Greek New Testament may be regarded as TEXTUALLY CERTAIN."Â (Carson, "The King James Version Debate," p.24,31)</blockquote>
Now, if it is not "Bibliolitry" for them to hold some PARTS as "certain," then on what basis of reason can it be Bibliolitry for us to hold the whole thing as "certain"? If they hold nothing in the Bible as perfect and certain then they "certainly" have found a way out of this corner and I will be forced to use a different argument. But let them come out and confess this belief in public! Let them say there is NOTHING whatsoever in any "bible" that one can be sure of at all and that there is no truth that it reveals that we can know certainly. Yet, if they will not confess this, then the argument stands: If they are not worshipping their small part, we are not worshipping the whole!

I do not believe you should worship your KJV any more than I believe Moses wanted the people to bow down and pray to the tablets of law. Nevertheless, we are to honour, obey, respect, give heed, study, love, cherish (and a dozen other things) the Holy Bible! The great hymn we sing says it well:
<blockquote>My Precious Bible:

Like a star of the morning in its beauty

Like a sun is the Bible to my soul

Shining clear on the way of love and duty

As I hasten on my journey to the goal

Holy Bible my precious Bible

Gift of God and lamp of life

my beautiful Bible

I will cling to the dear old Holy Bible

As I hasten to the city of my King</blockquote>
W.H. Griffith Thomas was a great preacher of the coming Kingdom. His reply to this accusation is worthy of note, as we apply it to the arguments against King James Onlyism:
<blockquote>"Someone says 'Is not this what is called Bibliolitry?' No it is not. You do not interpose the Bible between yourselves and Christ. If I go out tonight and desire to see the stars with a telescope, will that be an interposition? It will be a medium...When a boy receives a letter from his mother, his school friends may say 'Oh how perfectly absurd for you to trouble about a bit of paper like that!' 'Ah', says the boy, 'It is not the paper, it is what is on it. That paper represents my mother's interest, my mother's love. And so far from being a hindrance, it represents and expresses my mother's love to me when I cannot be in her presence."</blockquote>
Indeed, belief in a perfect Bible is simply belief in an omnipotent God that is able to preserve it!

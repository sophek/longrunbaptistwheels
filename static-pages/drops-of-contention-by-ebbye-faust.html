        <h1> DROPS OF CONTENTION (BY EBBYE FAUST) </h1>

            DROPS OF CONTENTION (By Ebbye Faust) Proverbs 27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. There is nothing that will sap joy out of a marriage faster than contention. Though men are not free from this sin, women are well-known for it. Proverbs tells us that if you are a contentious woman, your husband will be much happier away from you than with you! Women have the unique ability to cause their homes to be places of refreshment and peace, or places of strife and contention. Regardless of your husbands personal sins, the Bible exhorts you to be full of the Spirit, peacemakers, obedient, kind and gentle. These attributes cannot coexist with a contentious spirit. What do I mean by the word contention? All women understand it well. It is the mean-spirited retort to a husband's question. It is a refusal to do even the smallest task asked of you without some bitter comment. It is the many "punishments" you inflict him with when you refuse to talk to him, ignore him, and refuse eye contact when he goes against your will or has made you angry. Many women love to withhold the "marriage bed" to make him suffer for his wrongdoing. Contention is also the refusal to walk under his headship in obedience to him. A contentious woman always has a reason for why she doesn't obey her husband, such as "it is unreasonable," "I don't want to" or "I will do what I want to do." I see so many women who walk around with frowning, angry faces. We have all been around the type of woman that is never happy (maybe you fall into this category!), and is always complaining and bitter. Someone (usually her husband) is constantly doing her wrong, or hurting her feelings, or making her angry. She is always angry with someone for offending her. The Bible calls this contention also. When a woman gets like this, she needs to get back the joy of the Lord, and to begin to serve and love her husband and others as much as she serves and loves herself. She must choose not to be so easily offended with those around her, and walk in a spirit of forgiveness and kindness. I must admit that I feel sorry for Christian women today. We have the world against us, and unless we keep our hearts with all diligence (Prov.4:23) and do all that is within our power to separate from the world, we will be fighting a loosing battle. Society is painted with such a strong feminist influence, that a woman cannot go anywhere without her armor on. Even when going to the grocery store, she is going to have to fight the "Cosmo girl" image. And going to the mall is like walking into a nightmare. If she watches TV or movies I will dare say that she will not walk away unharmed. Let's face it, the "entertainment" that is put out today is not trying to influence you to reverence your husband, or to be gentle and kind. What you will see is a sassy girl (without much in the way of clothes upon herself to insure she keeps the man's interest) constantly shooting forth a quick and sarcastic remark that puts her man in his place, which is, having him always under her control. She is certainly not going to be sweet, gentle or meek. Her main goal in life is to please herself, and nobody is going to get in her way without severe punishment. There is no way in the world that I would allow my two daughters to be influenced by this type of woman! She is far from the Lord's ideal of a godly woman. We must diligently search the Scriptures to find out how the Lord wants us to be. Most likely it will go against what we naturally would like to be, and it will certainly go against Hollywood! Modern women cannot stand to be told what to do. If her husband even tries to use his God-given authority to direct his home, immediately sparks of contention begin to fly. Many husbands are simply unwilling to deal with their wives when they get like this, so he becomes passive so as never to cross her will (many parents do the same thing; they know their children will have a fit if they tell them to do something, so they just let them do what they want). Others will roll up their sleeves and fight for their authority to be maintained in the home. Neither the husband or wife in either situation are happy or fulfilled. They become more and more miserable until they are often tempted to find an excuse to end the marriage. I have actually heard women say that they desired for their husbands to be more of a leader in their home, yet I would watch them when their husbands would finally muster up the courage to direct them. What would follow would be nothing short of insanity. The wife would refuse to be led. She just liked the idea of having a Biblical Christian home as a beautiful passing thought. It was not something she truly wanted to be put into practice - unless her husband learned to lead her in things that she wanted to do anyway (no self denial for her, thank you!). Christian women have to realize that we have been called out of the world to serve the Lord, not ourselves. We must seek to be holy, full of the Spirit, full of joy, and an encouragement to everyone around us! We must not be bitter, whining or self seeking. The fastest way to have a miserable discontented husband is to be a contentious wife. You are the only wife he has! He can only learn to live with it, stay away from you as much as possible, or fall into sin and seek to replace you. But the Lord wants us to repent of our contentions and commit ourselves to following Him in all things. This is the only way your marriage will be truly blessed!

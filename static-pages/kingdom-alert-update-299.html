NEWS
*******************
-We are planning another Kingdom-Rewards conference at the first of March, 2008. Stay tuned for details.

-We have a new Kingdom Baptist web site. Watch for even more pictures, latest audio sermons, etc.

-Please pray for dear Brother Bill Jackson (of Christians Evangelizing Catholics). He had a heart attack, but is regaining strength and recovering.

-I have lost some emails from a couple of months ago, due to some computer troubles that are (once again) now resolved, praise God. If I have not replied, please resend your email. I am also missing some addresses. Praise God for God-fearing, kingdom-seeking friends around the world!

-A dear Christian sister and friend has written a very informative and helpful book on Biblical diet and nutrition. It is now offered on CD. You can visit her website at:

http://www.eatinaftereden.com/

Her website states:

"With three family members having served as judges, Sylvia Zook, MS, PhD, developed an acute sense of justice. She was preparing to enter law school at the University of Alabama, when serious health issues motivated her to change her undergraduate major to nutrition. Later, when she sustained serious injuries in an auto accident, she spent that long period of recuperation studying for her Master's degree and doctorate, then 'hit the ground running!' Ten years of higher education, 38 years of research, and Dr. Zook's practice, have resulted in evidence-based bioavailable nutrition 'tried in the fire.'"

You can read some excerpts from the book, and order the CD online.

-Also please pray for me as I finish some book projects that I hope will be a blessing to many.

MODERN HYPOCRISY CONCERNING STATE SUBMISSION
*************************************************************
Romans 13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

There are two unbiblical extremes that are popular today concerning Romans 13. On one side are those who do not take the command to submit to the state far enough; on the other side, are those who are so submissive and careless that they border on state idolatry. Prophecy warns of both errors. Peter speaks of a coming age when men will be rebellious against government (in all its spheres):

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

This is a great evil. Although the church is given the authority to rebuke sin - even in magistrates - we must not rail in a sinful manner.

On the other side, the Book of Revelation warns that an age is coming when the world will again be ruled by "kings" with totalitarian powers (Revelation 17:12-13). Revelation 13 predicts the coming age of Satanic state-worship, through the Antichrist. It will be Hitler's dream fulfilled on a worldwide scale. In earlier decades, Rudolf Hess shouted at Nazi rallies, "Hitler is Germany, just as Germany is Hitler." A mindless populace, bewitched and manipulated by power-mad leaders preying on emotion and fear, is not a wise or godly populace.

Usually, those who do not take Romans 13 far enough are over-reacting to the passive mindlessness of so many modern Christians. These modern, sedated Christians have forgotten that John Bunyan (a Baptist) went to jail (and wrote "The Pilgrim's Progress") for refusing to accept a minister's license. They have forgotten that Baptists, etc., were often jailed, fined and whipped (sometimes to death) in the American colonies for meeting and preaching "unlawfully," outside the state-established churches. These modern Christians have enjoyed the liberties given to them through the blood and sweat of early Baptists, etc., who were willing to suffer persecution and petition their government for the First Amendment. Yet, today, if a preacher so much as questions the legality of certain requirements placed upon churches; if he decries the ever-narrowing sphere that churches have to minister in freely, and begins to sound an alarm, he is quickly met with bitter disdain and contempt. He is automatically branded a rebellious trouble-maker. In recent decades, Christians have passively surrendered their rights to operate children's homes without licensing and state-control, their right to feed the poor without licensing and state control, their right to operate church schools without licensing and state control, etc. They have surrendered God's ways state-ordained psychological "experts." Where will it end? Maybe some Christians will finally awake when they can no longer serve their "potluck" dinners without a license!

But we know that reactions can often go too far. In order to escape the mindless submission of many fellow Christians to the growing state-leviathan (like the proverbial frog in hot water), some have foolishly maintained that the "minister" in Romans 13 is not a state minister, but a church minister. Others have taught or implied that the disobedience or sinfulness of a state official automatically annuls government laws. Yet, Paul was writing at a time when the Roman "Republic" had quietly transformed itself into the Roman "Empire." People awoke one day to find that they were under a different government than their forefathers had envisioned. Many of the Caesars were ruthless. It was necessary for Paul to remind the saints in Rome that, although God may not be pleased with the actions of certain authorities, nevertheless, the authority itself is not automatically annulled. God ordained Pharaoh (Exodus 9:16), Samson (Judges 14:4), and Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 25:9). He can cause the wrath of man to praise Him (Psalms 76:10). This is the same lesson concerning authority that is given by the Holy Ghost in other realms. Notice the following lessons concerning authority:

1 Peter 2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; NOT ONLY TO THE GOOD and gentle, but ALSO TO THE FROWARD.
3:1 LIKEWISE, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any OBEY NOT the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;

Who was the "king" that was to be honored at that time? I doubt that he was a nice fellow. What does God teach and command in the above verses? He commands His people, in all of their various, social spheres (e.g. citizens, servants, wives, children, etc.), not to excuse themselves from obedience merely on the account of some forwardness or disobedience in the life of an authority. There are obviously situations where the actions of an official (in whatever realm, state, home, church, etc.) might diminish or annul his authority. But, as the Declaration of Independence reminds us, authority is not to be rejected "for light and transient causes."

On one side, hypocrisy is seen in the fact that sometimes the most zealous, so-called "anti-government" advocates, are nevertheless strong on family and church authority. They believe wives should submit to husbands, children should obey parents, and church members should submit to pastors and church authority. Notice the following verses:

Ephesians 5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in EVERY thing.

1 Peter 2:13 Submit yourselves to EVERY ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

Those who are fundamental and fervent in regard to the doctrines of pastoral-authority, husband-authority, and fatherly-authority, should be just as zealous in regard to the doctrine of state-authority, in the manner taught in the Scriptures.

Nevertheless, on the other side, there seems to be a double portion of hypocrisy! Those Christians who cry the loudest about "Romans 13," and the commands to submit to the state, are usually the weakest concerning "Hebrews" 13:

Hebrews 13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints...

They are not afraid to speak evil, presume motives, and slander pastors. This same class of Christians also often neutralizes the commands for wives to obey husbands. How blind they are to their blatant hypocrisy. They will immediately scorn the slightest conscientious rebellion against government, yet they will defend rebellious wives and rebellious church members as if they are the noblest souls among men.

How quickly they will rail against certain pastors for daring to press for holiness. They despise church votes that go against their own desires and prejudices. Their view of pastoral and church authority is very thin and shallow. And when it comes to wives obeying husbands, they almost lose their minds. The doctrine is only admitted with so many disclaimers that the husband's authority is not only null and void, it is absolutely ridiculous!

How can this be? How can these Christians actually teach or imply that the government is to be obeyed in an absolute sense, but that church and family authority (also ordained!) are to be obeyed ONLY when they agree with the whim of the church member or the wife? Why are they so quick to define "every thing" in Ephesians 5:24 as practically meaning "no thing," yet "every" in 1 Peter 2:13 is defined in the most absolute sense imaginable! Is this reasonable?

Our concept of authority should be Biblical and consistent across the board. Authority should be given the benefit of the doubt. It should be cheerfully obeyed when it is functioning in its proper sphere. But when it issues a blatantly evil command, it must be disobeyed:

Acts 5:28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name?...
29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

Commands outside the properly ordained realm of authority are also null and void. A pastor or church has no right to demand that a church member decorate the living room of his home with polka dotted wall-paper. A man has no right to demand that another man's wife sweep his own floor without pay. Many modern Christians are very quick to see the misplaced authority in these examples. In fact, when it comes to church or home authority, most modern Christians are far TOO ready to cry "abuser," "dictator," "pope." They have been taught well. This is partly the result of humanistic education in public schools, and a depraved Hollywood/rock music culture. These influences undermine authority in the church and home (especially since it is ordained by God as male). Yet, in the vacuum, this humanistic education/culture also indoctrinates people into a passive state-idolatry. For example, feminism seeks to destroy the authority of the husband, but it quickly replaces it with Big Brother's Big Government. Therefore, the same Christians that are too quick to see abuses of authority by husbands and pastors are practically blind to the abuses of the state in church related issues. They cry or imply that husbands and pastors have no right to rule - even in their proper realms. Nevertheless, they smile silently as the state unlawfully moves into the realms of the church and family. Rebels who emotionally refuse to submit to husbands or churches are befriended and coddled. But those who have protested the state's over-reaching authority in regard to church or home are despised and rejected. The word "Laodicea" ("rights of the people") in Revelation 3 predicts this final state of things.

The Bible teaches that those who sinfully scorn authority are to be "smitten" (Proverbs 19:25), "punished" (Proverbs 21:11) and "cast out" (Proverbs 22:10) for the sake of others. Such commands (whatever their specific applications) are a far cry from the pampering that so many modern henpecked Christians give to the scorners of husbands, pastors and fathers. It is, however, amazing how quickly the deep-hearted sympathy is turned off, and the bowels of compassion are stopped up, when it comes to one who has rejected the state's authority over the local church. I have read posts on various internet boards (e.g. www.BaptistBoard.com, etc.) where Christians have railed against a Hovind or a Dixon as if they are antichrists for choosing to suffer loss rather than affirm the state's professed authority over a local church or ministry. Even if they disagree with the issue, why do they manifest such hatred?

Yet, many of these same Christians will turn around and become feminists and practical infidels in their views of church or home authority. Again, this follows the feminist model. It shows how infected (by culture) so many Christians have become. Hillary Clinton and her friends want Big Brother ("the village experts") to control children from birth. But Moses refused to go to the wilderness and leave the young ones to Pharaoh. Too many Christians know more of Hillary Clinton than they do Moses. Therefore, since "evil communications corrupts good manners," it is no wonder that these Christians demonize any and all "rebellion" by churches against state abuses of authority, yet they applaud women who rebel against husbands, and church members who rebel against church authority.

Further hypocrisy is discerned when we realize that those who are first in spewing forth angry words against those who have rejected state authority over the church, are often the greatest defenders of Martin Luther King and civil disobedience for "civil rights." On one side, they say, "The law is the law. These preachers need to obey the law of the land and quit making trouble." Yet, on the other side, they praise the feminists and civil rights leaders for their disobedience to state law.

The separation of church and state (a wall to keep government from meddling in church affairs, etc.) is a Biblical, natural and Constitutional law that has been observed and defended by the greatest of saints. Even the Christian teachers who have been the most vocal against Christians being involved in politics (Panton, Lang, etc.), were likewise the most vocal about the government staying out of the church! D.M. Panton writes:

"The church must no more interfere with the State, than the State may interfere with the Church."
(April 15, 1935)

"State and Church are complete circles that never intersect."
(Dec. 16, 1935)

They therefore warned against the coming "federated church" and "state idolatry":

"Deep down in its bedrock foundations all human lawlessness is necessarily identical; and with the eradication of God, and the disappearance of moral right, the collective welfare, regarded in terms of pure materialism, leads directly to a State autocracy which must arrogate to itself the privileges of Deity...It is here where Fascism and Communism meet..."
(Aug. 15, 1931)

"...Internationalism has grown much stronger, as the goal of the world...The worship of the State, and of its embodiment head, draws nearer daily."
(Oct. 15, 1931)

They believed that, while Caesar should be given what belongs to him, it is equally true that what belongs to God (the church) should not be given to Caesar!:

"...what definitely concerns [the Christian] is whether he is to be allowed to render to God the things that are God's...we are confronted at once with a State organization so absolute, so exclusive, as to leave no room for the Church of God...with inviolable laws of her ownÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Fatal to the Christian church is any acceptance of idolatrous nationalism." (Feb. 15, 1933)

We must be Biblically consistent in our understanding of ordained authority. For example, we should fervently teach the submission of wives in this age of apostasy; yet we should also teach and praise the courage of an Abigail, who disobeyed in a life and death emergency. With fear and trembling, I do not believe that a wife must contract foolish debt (credit cards, etc.) against her conscience. I do not believe she has to leave her children in a day-care and go to work outside the home at the whim of her husband. In the same way, I do not believe that churches must ask permission from the government to preach or carry out any ministries that the Lord has given them authority to perform:

Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, ALL POWER is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

The Bible is filled with praises for believers who disobeyed sinful commands of the state. In fact, it calls such disobedience "faith":

Hebrews 11:23 By FAITH Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and THEY WERE NOT AFRAID OF THE KING'S COMMANDMENT.
24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, REFUSED be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

Will there be much of this kind of "faith" on earth when the Lord returns?

Time would fail me to speak of the Hebrew midwives, Rahab, Daniel and his friends, and multitudes of saints throughout the ages, who were bold to resist unlawful commands of the state by faith. Where is this spirit today?

When the Bible teaches that the state should be obeyed in "every" thing, it means in all things lawful. Laws must be examined and tested. Are they against natural law (Romans 2:15)? Some modern law professors (e.g. Dershowitz) are actually denying that natural law even exists! Today, too many equate moral law with civil law (as if whatever is legislated is automatically God's law). In the U.S., the ultimate law of the land is the Constitution. Congress is forbidden to make any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The founding fathers established the jury system as one important check on abusive or illegal laws.

In summary, there is a time to go the extra mile, even in the face of oppression. But there is also a time to stand, and suffer, if need be, for principle. Let us flee hypocrisy. And if your brother chooses to draw the line in the sand quicker than you would approve, perhaps he has greater faith and courage. At the very least, let us pray and empathize with those who suffer for conscience sake:

Romans 14:10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

*******************************************************************
"OBEDIENCE TO THE STATE" BY D.M. PANTON (1870-1955)
*******************************************************************

"...the Apostles are commanded into the most dangerous spot of all...'in the temple.' [Acts 5:20]. But now a problem of all the ages confronts the Church. The Apostles are immediately face to face with the tremendous power of the State, a power made all the more formidable by the Apostles themselves. For they themselves had laid it down [Romans 13]...at the moment Paul wrote it was Dictatorship created by the Army...Peter himself underlines the obedience, and brings in the personal sanction of Christ: Paul says, Every soul; Peter says, Every ordinance [1 Pet. 2: 13]. All government therefore rests ultimately, not on economic helpfulness or political expedience, but on Divine authority; and the obedience commanded, in general, is absolute.

Moreover, the special problem which confronted the Apostles is exactly the complex problem that has constantly recurred. It was not so much the State, as a State-established Religion, that was seeking to stamp the Christians out. The Sanhedrim - 'all the senate of the children of Israel' - authorized by Imperial Rome, exercised the judicial power, while Roman officers executed their decrees. This is the exact attitude of the Papacy all down the centuries: established on the power of the State, the Roman Church denies that she kills, but claims that all she does is to hand the 'heretic' over to the Sword of the secular Power; the Church condemns, the State executes...

Now therefore the crisis arrives [Acts 5:28]...The Apostolic answer is for all time [Acts 5:29]. The State has a Divine authority which can be resisted only on Divine authority: therefore, when the clash comes, a clash which is explicit and certain between the State's law and God's law, the Apostles decide ['We ought to OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN']. It is a golden rule for all churches, under all circumstances, for all time. To oppose the State, without the authority of God, is a sin in itself, and therefore the consequences are not martyrdom, but the penalties of fanaticism; but WHEN MEN FORBID WHAT GOD COMMANDS, or command what God forbids, and when that contradiction is explicitly provable by Scripture, at all costs God alone is to be obeyed.

So therefore Peter puts the principle into immediate action; and in the hearing and before the very eyes of the Sanhedrim, which had strictly forbidden, under threat of death, the proclamation of the Gospel, proclaims it, whatever might be the consequences; and in doing so purposely exalts the 'crown rights of the Redeemer'...[Acts 5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a PRINCE and a Saviour...] He is already, de jure though not de facto, King of kings and Lord of lords, and therefore outdistancing all other monarchs in lawful and final authority. The principle on which we are to act thus develops before our eyes. The Christian is a citizen of the country in which he dwells, so far as subjection and obedience to the Civil Power is concerned; but in all other realms - the realms of affection, of reason, of activity, of devotion - ['our conversation is in heaven' - Phil. 3: 20], and we are 'strangers and pilgrims' in every country on earth (Heb. 11: 13).

...A revelation of extraordinary value closes and crowns the drama. [Acts 5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.] The Apostles...knew, by what had happened, that they had obtained a spiritual rank - a toughness of spiritual fibre - which made it possible for God to entrust them with sharp suffering. The greater our load, the greater God's estimate of our carrying capacity, for He has definitely undertaken not to impose more than we can bear. The Apostle's joy thus rests on a truth for the Church of God in all lands and all ages which will become only more golden as suffering grows more acute. To the threat of death Luther replied:- 'It's just as if I thought I could terrify a man by letting him ride off freely on his own bridled horse. Could there be more contemptible menace than that of death to Christians, since they are conquerors and lords of death?' The first hymn he wrote commemorated the young martyrs of Brussels. When the details of their sufferings reached him, he broke down in tears and said:- 'I thought I should be the first to suffer martyrdom for the Gospel's sake, but I was not worthy.'"

TOZER: "ALMOST" KJV ONLY
*************************************

[Note: I do not endorse the idea that all versions are somehow equal in light. I hold that the AV is without error. Nevertheless, the following article by Tozer is revealing. It demonstrates that many great men in past ages were actually struggling between what they were hearing from the Holy Spirit through their discernment, and what they were "supposed" to believe based on academic, "scholarly" influences. In regard to new versions, Tozer did not discover the rat. But he was certainly beginning to smell it! Too often, we sadly settle down, oppressed and depressed because the answer to our problem - the way of escape - seems too strange. It always seems easier to be "normal" - until we break the chains and become "radical." Then we look back and wonder why we suffered for so long.]


========================================================
Excerpts from "Confessions of a New Version Addict" by A.W. Tozer:
========================================================

"Since shortly after my conversion to Christ as a teen-ager I have been addicted to the habit of acquiring and BEING DISAPPOINTED with new versions of the Scriptures, both revisions and new translations.

It is a habit I cannot shake off. In spite of a long record of frustrated hopes and cruel disappointments, to this day I have but to hear a new version of the Scriptures has come out and I am off to the book-seller to pick up a copy. As Ponce de Leon, otherwise a sensible enough fellow, knocked about the world looking for a nonexistent fountain of youth, so I continue to look for the new version that will make any other new versions unnecessary by bringing out the meanings of the Holy Scriptures as sharply as the developer brings out the details of the picture on a photographic plate.

But it never works out that way. After poring over the new book for a few days or weeks and finding that it is just one more version, I put it aside and RETURN TO MY FIRST LOVE, the familiar KING JAMES BIBLE. I know its mistakes very well, its mistranslations and confused tenses; I should, for the Bible teachers are forever correcting it in public and the introductions to the new versions never tire of pointing out these flaws in the grand old English Bible.

It has been my experience that the new versions make at least one mistake for every one they correct, so by the time the trusting reader has reached the last chapter of the Book of Revelation he is back where he started and just goes out by that same door where in he went. And in the meanwhile he has lost the incalculable benefit of constant and intimate mental association with the clearest, richest and most beautiful English to be found anywhere among the libraries of the World, THE AUTHORIZED VERSION.

...While it is important that the translations be accurate and faithful, yet better versions do not make better men. And this brings us to consider those translators who think to do God service by packing into the English text every possible shade of meaning the word will bear in the original. The synonyms are put in brackets and the reader, apparently, just takes his choice. This would never do anywhere else. Imagine reading to a child.

'Twinkle, twinkle (blink, wink, shine intermittently, sparkle), little (diminutive, small, wee, tiny) star (heavenly body, luminary, orb, sphere), How I wonder (question, puzzle over, dubitate) what you are (be, have identify with, belong under the description of),
Up above (atop, opposite to down, contrary to direction of gravity) the world (the earth, the abode of human-kind) so high (elevated), Like a diamond (gem, precious stone, crystallized carbon) in the sky (the heavens, the firmament, the empyrean)'

Yet this is the latest RELIGIOUS WORD GAME in evangelical circles and we are all urged to play at it. For myself, I cannot keep serious while reading such a version, so I just pass up these uncertain translators and turn to one who can make up his mind. I have a secret love for decisiveness. It is quite natural for us humans to ignore the high moral intent of the Holy Scriptures and get lost in verbiage. 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,' says the old version, and multitudes over the centuries have knelt in penitence and tearfully sought to know true poverty of spirit; lately the fad seems to be to try to find shades of meaning for the words and to express them in more colloquial language. I wonder if anyone benefits by having the same thing said several different ways for him.

A few hundred years ago it was considered very much the thing for ministers preaching in English to interlard their sermons with frequent Greek and Latin words and phrases, always left un-translated by the speaker. His hearers were no doubt duly impressed with his learning but they had not the faintest notion what he was talking about. He has now been displaced by the preacher who knows enough Greek to make him uncomfortable and can never resist the temptation to turn every sermon into a classroom lecture. I have sometimes thought (and I trust not uncharitably) that the knowledge of a little Greek is a great convenience to such a man, for the Greek being a remarkably accommodating language enables him to preach anything he wants to without being challenged.

All this is not to cry down true scholarship nor to discourage honest attempts to put the Bible into modem speech. It is rather to confess that I have not become a holier man nor a better preacher by my incurable addiction to new versions of the Scriptures. I find that if I am failing to live in accordance with the will of God, I get no relief by reading about that will in a new translation. As soon as God shows a man the way, it is his duty and happy privilege to walk in it. If he refuses or neglects to walk in it he may seek some temporary consolation by looking about for some version that will say the same thing to him in a different way. While he is jockeying about for new shades of meaning his conscience may get a bit of rest, but I am sure that a faithful God will not let him escape.

...I really don't need any more new versions, but I'll probably buy the next one that comes out. Maybe someday I'll find something sufficiently different to justify the expense. But I haven't up to now."

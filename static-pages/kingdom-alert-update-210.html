WHY OVERTHROWING SODOMY LAWS WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE

"[Sodomy is] an offense of so dark a nature, the very mention of which is
a disgrace to human nature, a crime not fit to be named."
(William Blackstone, "Commentaries on the Laws of England," Vol. IV, 1769)

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves...

Symbolic of an ever-increasing depravity, the U.S. Supreme Court has
OVERTHROWN the laws against sodomy, ruling 6-3 that such laws are
unconstitutional. This past weekend, a brother fro church wore a sign that
said, "Sodomy is Evil" as he preached the Gospel. Though some agreed, the
general response of people on the street was, "But sodomy is now legal!"
Obviously, people today are grossly unable to discern the difference
between God's law and man's law. Modern man may think he is wise for
"overthrowing" his father's laws against sodomy (Proverbs 22:28, 24:21,
Psalms 11:3), but that does not mean that GOD has overthrown HIS LAW
against it! In fact, God sooner or later responds to man's perversity by
doing some OVERTHROWING of His own - especially where sodomy is concerned:

2 Peter 2:6 And turning the cities of SODOM and Gomorrha into ashes
condemned them with an OVERTHROW, making them an ENSAMPLE unto those that
after should live ungodly;

Increasingly, many now view the state as "God." Their values are largely
shaped by the state. Whether it be divorce, infanticide, or sodomy, if the
state rules it is a "right," the conscience of man receives the state's
sanctification as a soft cushion for the conscience.

Those who are now rejoicing that the government appears to be taking a
step backward from dictating every area of private life, should pause for
a moment and realize that blatant, moral depravity (condemned by the
natural conscience of man), when sanctified by the state, always
eventually leads to greater power in the hands of the government. As
sinful passions are no longer properly restrained by law in one area, the
government grows fat with new programs to deal with the CONSEQUENCES of
the unrestrained sin. For example, the state allows (and often promotes)
infanticide and no-fault divorce as "rights." One consequence of this is
that fornication and adultery increase. Then, sexually transmitted
diseases increase. And then, the next thing we know, police officers are
guarding doctors as they FORCEFULLY vaccinate babies AGAINST the wishes of
their parents. There are many examples of this that could be offered.

It is very true that state laws cannot regenerate man. They cannot "bring
in the Kingdom" (only Antichrist's, imitation kingdom). But government IS
called by God to serve as a partial "restraint" (i.e. "terror") to
evil-doers (Romans 13:3). Early Baptists and other defenders of religious
liberty blessed the world at the founding of America by showing that
government is NOT called to take up the spiritual keys and litigate in the
area of religious conscience. Yet, almost all Christian leaders have
recognized SOME duty of government to restrain the outward manifestation
of evil. In Justin Martyr's "Second Apology," he quotes an early Christian
who reproved a state official:

"Why have you punished this man, not as an adulterer, nor fornicator, nor
murderer, nor thief, nor robber, nor convicted of any crime at all, but
who has only confessed that he is called by the name of Christian? This
judgment of yours, O Urbicus, does not become the Emperor Pius..."

Romanism (arising in the following centuries) soon became known for the
ungodly interference of civil magistrates into the realm of religion. This
was not corrected for many centuries, when Baptist writers began to issue
their treatises on the legitimate sphere of government, rebuking Rome AND
the bloody Reformers. Benjamin O. True (in "Baptist Principles Reset,"
1902) writes:

"It is abundantly manifest that, when Roger Williams declared to the
Puritans of Massachusetts Bay that the civil magistrate had no right to
punish men for the violation of the FIRST TABLE - that is, the first four
commandments of the Decalogue - he advanced a principle which had been
held more than a hundred years earlier by Hubmaier and had been urged by
his own countrymen when Williams was a mere youth."

Williams helped destroy the state-church heresy. He was certainly a
defender of religious liberty. Yet, Williams saw sodomy (sometimes called
"buggery") as a dangerous, abominable crime that could destroy whole
nations. The free colony that Williams founded (i.e. Rhode Island), made
sodomy a capital offense. In 1647, with Roger Williams present, Rhode
Island passed the following resolution:

"Touching Whoremongers. First of Sodomy, which is forbidden by this
present Assembly throughout the whole Colony, and by Sundry Statutes of
England....It is a vile affection, whereby men given up thereto, leave the
natural use of woman, and burn in their lusts, one toward another; and so
men with men work that which is unseemly, as that Doctor of the Gentiles
in his letter to the Romans once spake, i.27; The Penalty concluded by
that State [England] under whose authority we are, is Felony of death,
without remedy."

Pennsylvania (led by the Quakers) would remove the death penalty for
sodomy in 1786; yet the state still deemed it a crime punishable by jail
time. In fact, it was not until 1872 that South Carolina removed the death
penalty for sodomy (leaving only jail and/or fines for the crime). And the
man most admired for his toleration by the world, Thomas Jefferson,
advocated that Virginia law should punish sodomites by CASTRATION!

The pendulum has now swung to the opposite side (as the Bible predicts).
Let us therefore shine the light of reason on the modern extreme. One
problem which results in totally removing sodomy as a crime, is that
adoption agencies will no longer be able to refuse children to homosexual
couples. The proof of this is found in the latest, ACLU' response to the
Supreme Court decision:

"'This decision will affect VIRTUALLY EVERY IMPORTANT LEGAL AND SOCIAL
QUESTION involving lesbians and gay men,' said James Esseks, Litigation
Director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. 'For years,
whenever we have sought equality, we've been answered both in courts of
law and in the court of public opinion with the claim that we are not
entitled to equality because our love makes us CRIMINALS. That argument -
which has been a serious block to progress - is now a dead letter.' Esseks
added, 'from now on, cases and political debates about employment, CUSTODY
and the treatment of same-sex couples should be about merit, not about who
you love.'....'With this decision, the Court has finally recognized that
we are part of the American family. Now it's time for the rest of society
to do the same,' Esseks said....By acknowledging that we are NOT
CRIMINALS, this decision will make it far easier for us to get society to
change." (ACLU.org)

In an article titled, "Why Sodomy Laws Matter" (6-26-03), the ACLU writes:

"These laws were used against gay people in three ways. First, they were
used to limit the ability of gay people to raise children. They were used
to justify denying gay parents custody of their own children (Alabama,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia). They've also been used to justify
refusing to let gay people ADOPT (Florida, Mississippi) and refusing to
let gay people become foster parents (Arkansas, Missouri). Second, the
laws have been used to justify firing gay people, or denying gay people
jobs....In Utah, the sodomy law was used to justify not protecting gay
people from hate crimes. In Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi and Texas
theyâ€™ve been used to justify various proposals to ban ADOPTION or foster
care, sometimes successfully." (ACLU.org)

Therefore, Christians who are praising (for liberty reasons) the recent
decision of the Supreme Court, should realize that this "freedom" for
sodomites will turn into TYRANNY against employers, etc.; and, worst of
all, it will be tyranny against thousands of precious children who will -
even more than before - become victims to unbridled, sodomite depravities!

And finally, we must understand that the latest decision is not a move
AWAY from the mad rush toward totalitarianism. The most prudent
totalitarianism will UTILIZE depraved SEXUAL FREEDOMS to keep the masses
DRUGGED and DISTRACTED! Therefore, as sexual freedoms increase, other
liberties are shackled (like the right to hire whoever you desire, etc.).
In a foreword to his book, "Brave New World," Aldous Huxley writes:

"As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends
compensatingly to increase. And the dictator (unless he need cannon fodder
and families with which to colonize empty territories) will do well to
encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under
the influence of dope and movies and the radio, it will help to reconcile
his subjects TO THE SERVITUDE WHICH IS THEIR FATE."

Let us do what we can. That is all God expects. Let us continue to be
salt, and continue to "let" (i.e. restrain) by our preaching, writing and
witnessing. As the governments of the world increasingly hinder the good,
while blessing "the covetous" (Psalms 10:3), we can and MUST lift up the
mighty "spiritual sword" and reprove and rebuke with all long-suffering
and doctrine!:

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as
keep the law contend with them.

MATURE OR MANURE?: THE PERVERTED JUDGMENT OF CHRISTIAN MOVIE CRITICS

On a car radio I heard a woman's voice. She said she was "Holly on
Hollywood." She was a movie critic. She was discussing a new "Charlie's
Angels" movie. She began to talk excitedly of all the action and the
flashy clothes. Realizing the radio must be on a secular station, I was
nevertheless disgusted to hear the woman's glowing review. She praised the
movie for its wild scenes. After heaping praise after praise on this
movie, she began to say that it revealed partial nudity and sexual
innuendos in almost every scene. She therefore advised that only "MATURE"
teens should consider viewing the movie. She said that she was able to
really enjoy it once she "let herself go." I began to try to figure out
how to change the station or turn off the radio (it was a friend's car).
In the next moment, I was stunned to hear the station identify itself as
"The Word" (http://www.thewordfm.com/), and tell the "Christian" audience
to stay tuned for the Scott Wilder Show! Unbelievable! I then looked up
"Holly" (the movie critic) on the Internet. Her name is Holly McClure. Her
website is: http://holly.ibelieve.com (http://www.ibelieve.com/)

She may believe the Gospel, but she certainly doesn't believe the Bible's
warnings and commands for MATURE Christian living (Psalms 101:3, Proverbs
23:31, Romans 13:4, 2 Corinthians 6:17, James 4:4, 1 Corinthians 15:13,
etc.). We have come this far. The prophecies of Jude are coming to pass:

Jude 1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our
God INTO LASCIVIOUSNESS, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus
Christ.
17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
18 How that they told you there should be mockers IN THE LAST TIME, who
should walk after their own UNGODLY LUSTS.
19 These be they who separate themselves, SENSUAL, having not the Spirit.

Did I really hear a professing, Christian radio station excitedly praise
and RECOMMEND "Charlie's Angels" to CHRISTIANS? To TEENAGERS? And what did
she say? She said that only the MATURE teens should view this movie. In
other words, the ability to "let yourself go" and enjoy MANURE, is to be
MATURE! This appears to be a favorite theme of Holly's. In her review of
the obviously, blasphemous movie, "Bruce almighty," Holly writes:

"Iâ€™ll be frank, there are elements in this movie that will probably offend
many parents and even some adults who don't have kids like; crude
language, rude behavior, sexually suggestive dialogue and PERHAPS the fact
that Grace lives with Bruce before they're married. But think about
it...how can you show a character going through a spiritual transformation
and changes in his life (and behavior) if you don't show the sinful side
of him first? It's those very things that God exposes to Bruce that in the
end, Bruce repents for and ends up changing. That's why I'm making the
point that even though there are FUNNY scenes and a very humorous side to
this story, there's a serious side with a profound message so it's more of
a movie FOR MATURE PRE-TEENS to adults instead of kids."

Holly forgets that "evil communications corrupt good manners" (1
Corinthians 15:33). If she ever had discernment (Hebrews 5:14), it was
corrupted; she lost it once she began "letting herself go" and enjoying
worldly filth. With each new, sinful movie she reviewed, her conscience
became that much more seared and hardened.

In these days, the ability to snuggle up close to dung, without offense,
is a sign of Christian maturity! THIS is the mentality of much of MODERN
CHRISTIANITY. It stands in direct opposition to the Holy Scriptures:

Proverbs 7:7 And beheld among the SIMPLE ONES, I discerned among the
youths, a young man VOID OF UNDERSTANDING,
8 Passing through the street NEAR her corner; and he went the way to her
house,
9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the ATTIRE OF A HARLOT, and
subtil of heart.

Obviously, in the Charlie's Angels movie, (according to Holly) there is
nothing but continual close-ups of women wearing the attire of harlots.
And there are multitudes of SIMPLE Christians who are VOID OF
UNDERSTANDING who go the WAY to their houses. According to the Bible, this
is not a sign of maturity, but a sign of being a REBELLIOUS FOOL.

What we have in these perilous times is a bunch of beer-drinking,
nudity-watching Christians, who, incredibly, actually LOOK DOWN on the
Christians who do not indulge in their imagined liberties. Those who
preach against this "turning of God's grace into lasciviousness" are
viewed as IMMATURE and FOOLISH. Again, the Bible predicted this exact
state of affairs:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall
come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves...
3...DESPISERS OF THOSE THAT ARE GOOD,

1 John 3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
And WHEREFORE SLEW HE HIM? BECAUSE HIS OWN WORKS WERE EVIL, AND HIS
BROTHER'S RIGHTEOUS.
13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

Let us obey the Holy Ghost:

1 Peter 4:3 For the TIME PAST of our life may SUFFICE US to have wrought
the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess
of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
5 Who SHALL GIVE ACCOUNT to him that is READY to judge the quick and the
dead.

NEWS NOTES

SLIVERS OF SILVER

"Slivers of silver solve the problem of smelly socks - Smelly socks could
one day be just a nasty memory thanks to nanotechnology. Scientists in
South Korea have discovered a method of impregnating silver particles into
the polypropylene widely used in textiles, which give it 'excellent'
antibacterial properties. Silver has been shown to kill more than 650
disease-causing organisms and is also a safe antibacterial agent, enabling
the 'nanocomposite' fibres to be used as a weapon against malodorous
feet....Prof Jeong said: 'Even though they only contain a small amount of
silver our new fibres have excellent antibacterial properties and the
physical properties are not affected...' The pair have managed to make
safe anti-microbial fibres with a range of applications, including socks,
carpets, napkins and surgical masks. Amore Pacific, a Korean cosmetics
company, is already using nano silver particles in its under-arm
deodorants...."
(London Telegraph, 6-25, By Roger Highfield, Science Editor)

Comments:
A few of the various news organizations which had jumped on the bandwagon
(protecting the investments of the pharmaceutical industry) by reporting
the supposed "dangers" of Colloidal Silver, had no problem running the
above news item. Yet, the above news item simply CONFIRMS the claims made
by people who have discovered colloidal silver. Great is the conspiracy to
keep people dependent and ignorant of all the "poor man's medicine" which
God has provided. How ironic it will soon be when a whole product line of
silver-laced garments, items, etc. are unleashed upon the world! Will
there be many who will ask the simple question: If silver "has been shown
to kill more than 650 disease-causing organisms and is also a safe
antibacterial agent," then why have the early discoveries of doctors and
scientists concerning colloidalized silver been scoffed at and buried from
the public eye? Could it be that no one can PATENT a product that any man
can make in his home for the price of a glass of water? Let us let God
answer:

1 Timothy 6:10 For the love of money is the root of ALL evil...

Note: I am not teaching that our self-reliance on herbs, silver, etc. do
away with the need for Divine healing, or even "establishment" medical
doctors. In regard to the first, God can also heal through means, and
these means are not limited to establishment physicians:

1 Timothy 5:23 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy
stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.

I am only teaching that there is a great deal of "establishment"
chemical-drug taking and/or operations that are entirely unnecessary:

Mark 5:25 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that
she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his
garment.

RECORD BROKEN: STAGESETTING FOR TRIBULATION HAIL

"Initial reports stated that the hail had penetrated the roof of a home,
leaving holes in the structure large enough to crawl through. The stones
were saved and placed in a freezer at the residence and two national
weather service employees were sent to assess the damage
and record the size. The hailstone measured 6.5 inches....Prior to
today...the largest hailstone on record occurred in Coffeyville Kansas on
September 3, 1970. This stone measured 5.7 inches in diameter."
(www.crh.noaa.gov)

Revelation 16:21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every
stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the
plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

THE FRUITS OF HOME-SCHOOLING AND NO TV

"Home-schooled 14-year-old James Williams captures the coveted top spot in
the 2003 National Geographic Bee....So how does one boy find time for all
these activities? Possibly because he doesn't waste time watching the boob
tube. The Williamses haven't had a TV for years....After winning the
geographic bee, James found the darling of the national media....And, as
amazing as it may seem in this day of ubiquitous television, the same kid
who knows that cocoa is produced in the Ashanti region of Ghana, and that
the mouth of the Orinoco River is north of the mouth of the Zambezi River,
had never even heard of NBC's Katie Couric." ("The New American,"June 30,
2003)

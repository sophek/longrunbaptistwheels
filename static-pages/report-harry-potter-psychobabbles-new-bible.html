            "Harry Potter and the Shrinks - New Orleans (AP) - A roomful of psychiatrists analyzed Harry Potter and concluded the boy wizard is wonderful...The books are 'not merely escapes but tools for children and adults to work through their daily struggles,' said Dr. Daniel P. Dickstein, a pediatrician and resident in child psychology. Almost everyone in the audience of about 100 psychiatrists, psychiatry students and their spouses said they'd read at least one of the Potter books. Three-quarters had read all four...Biassey, who treats mainly adult patients, said he has worked with some children who've became obsessed with Harry Potter and take the books as proof that they don't have to obey adults. 'They think more in terms of how powerful they can be and get more control than anybody else,' he said, adding one 10-year-old became so violent her parents called the police. 'She was ready to take on the police department.' He said the girl has become less combative since Nancy Drew replaced Harry Potter in her bookshelves. Afterward, Biassey said the discussion made him 'rethink a lot of things.' He was most impressed by discussion of how parents can use the books to connect with their children and talk about ethics and values..." (AP, May 8, 2001) 

Comments: Harry Potter (i.e. a diabolical doorway to sorcery) has now become the bright and morning star of psychobabble. He is their doll. Why not? Psychology was created by Atheists with deep spiritual problems. They wanted to analyze man's spirit in the same way a physicist analyzes nature. Therefore, they were not only spiritually blind, they were lacking in practical common sense! Man has free will. Psychology is the religion of "scientism," not science. Carl Jung had a "spirit guide" he talked to. Freud and Jung "investigated" sorcery by practicing divination (like Wescott and Hort). Therefore, it is perfectly "normal" for psychiatrists to see Jesus and His modern followers as "troubled," while they delight in Harry Potter.

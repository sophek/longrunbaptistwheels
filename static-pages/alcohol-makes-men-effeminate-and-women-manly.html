        <h1>ALCOHOL MAKES MEN EFFEMINATE AND WOMEN MANLY</h1>

            "...alcohol is a guy's worst enemy...prolonged boozing can actually eat away at a man's body...He may also find himself becoming less of a lad and more of a lady, as his chest sprouts breasts, his hips become more curvaceous and his chin gets smoother...Heavy drinking can eat away at muscles, making them smaller and weaker...Sufferers tire easily on exertion, may find it hard to rise out of a chair or climb stairs, or may find themselves unsteady on their feet, or developing backache...This myopathy causes the muscle fibres to swell, then burst and die. Drinkers can also develop weaker bones. "Men who experience testosterone deprivation for any reason throughout their life have decreased bone mass," says Emanuele...Then there are the changes that, while seemingly more cosmetic, may be equally disturbing. Men who regularly drink large amounts may grow breasts and develop hips, as fat shifts from the abdomen. The reason for this bizarre development is down to hormones again: alcohol can upset the delicate balance between testosterone and the "female" hormone oestrogen. In fact, men and women have both hormones, but testosterone levels are normally higher in men. Alcohol appears to speed up the normal conversion of testosterone and one of its precursors, androstenedione, into oestrogens, explains Emanuele, possibly by stimulating the enzyme involved in this conversion. Feminine side: Schwartz offers another reason for this apparent feminisation. "The liver metabolises testosterone and oestrogen," he says. "If the liver is impaired as a result of long-term alcohol use, oestrogen is not removed from the blood and levels rise, which in turn suppresses testosterone."..Some alcoholic men may discover even more of their feminine side. They may find they don't have to shave as much and may start to lose facial and body hair, which are maintained by the all-important testosterone. "Hair loss can result from any condition where testosterone is low," says Emanuele...In one study, half the women who consumed three drinks (45 millilitres of alcohol) a day, and 60 per cent of those downing eight drinks (120 millilitres of alcohol) a day, suffered delayed ovulation or failed to ovulate. "Even moderate amounts of alcohol may cause infertility through suppressing ovulation," says Emanuele...And moderate drinking also increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, as alcohol seems to suppress progesterone, the hormone that prepares the wall of the womb for a fertilised egg and is crucial for a successful early pregnancy...What's more, too much alcohol can gradually destroy a woman's looks. Alcoholics are most at risk. "You can see it in their skin, which starts to look old," says Judith Gavaler, who has researched alcohol's effects for many years. These women may also lose their feminine figures as waist-to-hip ratio increases, and may grow more body hair, and develop a deeper voice and more aggressive behaviour, according to Eriksson."

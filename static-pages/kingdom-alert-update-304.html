MOTHERS: BLESSED, OPPRESSED OR DEPRESSED?

[A Mother's Day Sermon, May 11, 2008, Kingdom Baptist Church, Pastor Joey Faust.]

* TEXT: Proverbs 31:30. . .Her children arise up, and call her BLESSED. . .

There are some modern, so-called "progressive" ideas about what a mother is. These new, perverted ideas are in contrast to what God has ordained a mother to be, and what much of mankind has understood a mother to be throughout history:

* THE BANNED MOTHER:

Huxley's "Brave New World" predicted a time to come when "mother" would be seen as a bad word. Today, there is pressure on schools, around the world, by sodomite activists, to get rid of words like "mother." The Australians just rejected the change, for the time being. But others are not resisting the foolishness:

"Homosexual activists around the world are using language as a major front for their agenda...Following passage of same-sex 'marriage' legislation in Spain, the government ordered that 'mother' and 'father' were to be replaced in the State Civil Registries Family Book with Parent (progenitor) A and Parent (progenitor) B...This February nurses in Scotland were told ...they must avoid using the terms 'mother' and 'father'...the province of Ontario banned 'mother' and 'father'. . . from all Ontario statutes."
("United Press International")

California's schools are all now, officially and openly, homosexual indoctrination centers, since Gov. Arnold signed bill 777; it bans words like "Mama"! It mandates that schools teach that gender is relative!



This shows that you can "work out" your body, but still have the spiritual backbone of a tulip!

Satan, through this world system, is working to not only ban the "word" mother. He wants women that may otherwise be called to marriage, to ruin their lives, and futures, by living for pleasure, and despising "motherhood." There are people that want the world's population to be drastically decreased - especially in the West.

Therefore, silly women are being manipulated into using the beauty of their youth, not to build a family, but to exploit it and waste it on men who do not care. It is a terrible trick of the Devil.

Communist, Betty Friedan, ("The Feminine Mystique," 1963; founder of NOW) convinced a whole generation of women that homemaking was a "concentration camp."

Millions believed that true happiness and liberty were to be found in allowing their beauty to be exploited and wasted! It taught women that motherhood, in a traditional family, was "oppression"!

But the real captivity was when these women left traditional motherhood to become enslaved objects of evil men's lusts. They were servants of evil men, when they could have been winning a good man's love, and raising a family:

2 Peter 2:19 While they promise them LIBERTY, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall come.
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead CAPTIVE silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

Did this "Satanic liberty" bring happier women? No, they soon found that their "new master" was the real oppressor. Their beauty, worshipped and used by the world, only lasts for a brief moment. And then this world system will spit them out as worthless:

Proverbs 31:30...beauty is vain...

1 Peter 1:24 For all flesh is as grass...The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:

For centuries, mankind has known that women are happiest when they are selfless; pouring themselves into their families:

"To feel, to love, to suffer, to devote herself, will always be the text of the life of woman."
("The Royal Path of Life," 1882)

But what happens when women are led astray from being women? Will they find happiness?

Betty Friedan lost her marriage. Her ex-husband, describes her life. It was filled with amphetamines and alcohol; and mixed with her feminist mind-set, this led to insanity:

"She'd explode unexpectedly. . .She was the most violent person I have ever known. I've seen women frightened by her. Men, too."
(Carl Friedan, "Living With Insanity," chapter)

She would bloody him up, and gouge him. The accounts are demonic! It does not appear that feminism leads to happiness!

You don't hear much about it, but the greatest amount of domestic violence, statistically, is found in women who have "left the natural use," and have joined together in a household! In their perverted escape from so-called "male oppression," they begin to oppress one another.

In contrast, the women who are the happiest, are the ones who don't compete or fear male strength. They blossom as women in their trust for God and His ways. They are not afraid with amazement (1 Peter 3), and this sets them free to be women, according to God's design.



Even the world is forced to admit some of these self-evident truths. Research studies from Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, reveal that women are not as happy as they were before the feminist movement!:

"Men Are Now Happier Than Women. . .Two new research papers arrive at this conclusion. One tracked traditional happiness data by asking people how satisfied they are with their lives. It found that women, who in the early 1970s reported being slightly happier than men, are now slightly less happy. . .The other [study] analyzed time-use studies over the past four decades. . .women have replaced housework with paid work. . . and as a result are spending more time doing things they don't enjoy. . .both men and women seemed to dread their jobs. . .Both would much rather cook or do laundry. . ."
(www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/26)


"[Friedan's] book helped spark the sexual revolution of the 1970s and fueled the notion that that [wives who pursued careers out of the home would become] happier. Last week, two sociologists at the University of Virginia published an exhaustive study of marital happiness among women that challenges this assumption. Stay-at-home wives, according to the authors, are more content than their working counterparts. . .the most interesting data may be that the women who strongly identify as progressive - the 15 percent who agree most with feminist ideals - have a harder time being happy than their peers. . . Feminist ideals, not domestic duties, seem to be what make wives morose. . ."
(www.slate.com)

Obviously, Satan's rebellious and perverse ways will always, ultimately, lead to destruction - even in this life. God told Cain that his countenance would be lifted if he obeyed what is right (Genesis 4). Instead, Cain went his own way; the way of the world.

* THE DISTRACTED MOTHER:

If Satan cannot ban motherhood, he must pervert it. The "distracted mother" is set forth as his ideal. She must not be selfless and truly feminine. She must seek a career, or go after some "cause" in a manner that abandons her children's care and discipline to others.

But what is the fruit of this feminism?:

Proverbs 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his MOTHER TO SHAME.

Proverbs 31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
28 Her children arise up, and CALL HER BLESSED; her husband also, and he praiseth her.

Satan is trying to cheat mothers out of the blessing of verse 28! He wants mothers to end up with shame and regret, and alienation from their children. This can be seen in a recent news headline about another feminist leader who left a path of destruction behind her:

"The day feminist icon Alice Walker resigned as my mother - In the mid-1980s, The New York Times ran a profile of the American writer and activist Alice Walker. Her novel, "The Color Purple," had won the Pulitzer prize and was being turned into a film by Steven Spielberg. The article was illustrated by a photograph of Walker sitting on her teenaged daughterâ€™s knee. It was meant to be a 'fun' picture; but, in retrospect, according to Rebecca Walker, the photographer unwittingly portrayed the true nature of her relationship with her mother. . .Walker's success as a campaigner was to her detriment as a mother. Like Dickens's Mrs Jellyby, who neglects her home and her children as she directs her energy towards the poor of Africa, so America's icon often went to feminist meetings and rallies and left Rebecca to fend for herself. Her daughter experimented with drugs and became pregnant at 14. . .mother and daughter are estranged with little hope of reconciliation. . .[According to Rebecca:] 'To have a daughter who was questioning feminism - it was seen as a threat'. . .'You've got young women saying, 'That didnâ€™t really work for me' and the older ones saying, 'Tough, because that's how it should be'. . .'I think sometimes of. . .feminism as being close to a cult. . .'"
("Times Online," May 4, 2008)



Did this child rise up and call her blessed? No. She had left the cult, and she must be despised and shunned.

Many children are growing up and leaving "the feminist cult," to various degrees. Some only want the choice, and they resent being persecuted if they decide to raise their home in a traditional way; they have seen the destruction of radical feminism (divorce, bitterness, unhappiness, unstable children, etc.). Others rightfully see that the whole agenda is demonically inspired, through evil men, for the purpose of population control and remaking society so that the state replaces the family. To whatever degree, this return to homemaking, modesty, home-schooling, submission, etc., is shocking to many. But it is not a rejection of the former generation; it is a rejection of the conspiring men and devils that deceived the former generation. The only choices in this final "falling away" are to go the other direction, or keep falling. What is next? After cross-dressing and immodesty came the sexual revolution and homosexuality. Does anyone with eyes want to stick around to see what the next generation will rebel against? Will they be cannibals with unmentionable perversions? It is obviously better that they rebel against the wrong choices of the former generation (as painful as that can be, if taken personally), than continue the fall into hell and tyranny!

* THE BLESSED MOTHER:

The false view of motherhood is based upon a lie! Somehow, Satan was able to convince Eve that she was oppressed in paradise! How could it be? Satan convinced her that one commandment was oppression! He promised her liberty into godhood, if she would take control of her home and defy God's ways. He seduced her into changing God's ways. Adam obeyed her, and God killed him!

Almost 6000 years later, Satan again convinced almost a whole generation of women that children are worthless! Who needs to be home with them? Certainly, telephones and computers are more important than little souls. Right?

What a lie! A century ago, women thought leaving the cradle for politics was a demotion! They felt they had the most influence in shaping the values of the next generation!

Is a human soul worthless? What will a man give in exchange for his soul?:

Psalms 127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.

Motherhood is a high calling!:

Proverbs 27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

If being a diligent servant has its own blessings, then how blessed must be the woman who is faithful to her husband and children? What honor will she receive, from her family, and God? What fruit will she receive?:

Proverbs 29:17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.

When we do things God's way, His blessings are released!

Satan has somehow convinced women that homemaking is to be despised:

1 Timothy 5:14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, GUIDE the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

But in God's eyes, it is a high calling. Will we believe God or Satan? We have seen the fruit of Satan's ways. It is abortion - baby murder. That is where it ends. The so-called sexual liberation movement ends in a Satanic sacrament. Babies must be sacrificed; burned in the fires (salt solution), or neglected. Paganism has come full circle. What shall be our revenge on such ungodly deception? Shall we wear the badges of Baal and show forth allegiance to the feminist and sexual revolution? Or shall we renounce all that is associated with this Satanic movement that has cost the lives of millions of infants? Women left what Friedan said was the "concentration camp" of homemaking, to literally burn millions of infants in "abortion ovens." This is just one of the "fruits" of following Satan.

In the face of such horror, let us encourage women to renounce the unfruitful works of darkness. Let us encourage them to be modest, submissive, stay-at-home mothers, who are happy with their feminine garments and calling.

One dear brother in our church, in prayer, said that he had grieved his mother by his sin, and now, he is grown and she is dead. He cannot make it up to her, but he can warn the next generation! The former generation cannot undo the destruction. The babies have been slain. Marriages and families have been ripped asunder. But one thing that can be done, is people can encourage the next generation to abandon the Satanic bait. They can expose it as a lie and exhort young folks to seek the old paths (see Titus 2 and the command for aged women).

Perhaps you received a sweet email that has been sent around. I don't think I have ever read one of these from the pulpit since e-mail was invented. But I will read some excerpts from this one:

"A woman, renewing her driver's license at the County Clerk 's office, was asked by the woman recorder to state her occupation. She hesitated, uncertain how to classify herself.Â  'What I mean is, ' explained the recorder,Â  'do you have a job or are you just a ...?' 'Of course I have a job,' snapped the woman. 'I'm a Mom'. . .I forgot all about her story until one day I found myself in the same situation...The Clerk was obviously a career woman. . .'What is your occupation?' she probed. What made me say it?Â  I do not know.Â Â  The words simply popped out. 'I'm a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.' The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair. . . I repeated the title slowly emphasizing the most significant words. Then I stared with wonder as my pronouncement was written, in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire. 'Might I ask,' said the clerk with new interest, 'just what you do in your field?' Coolly, without any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard myself reply, 'I have a continuing program of research, (what mother doesn't) In the laboratory and in the field, (normally I would have said indoors and out). . .Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?) and I often work 14 hours a day. . .But the job is more challenging than most run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just money.' There was an increasing note of respect in the clerk's voice as she completed the form, stood up, and personally ushered me to the door. As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab assistants - ages 13, 7, and 3.
Upstairs I could hear our new experimental model (a 6 month old baby) in the child development program. . .I felt I had scored a beat on bureaucracy!"

This reminds me of a recent news report about the worth of a stay-at-home mother:

"If a stay-at-home mom could be compensated in dollars rather than personal satisfaction and unconditional love, she'd rake in a nifty sum of nearly US$117,000 a year. That's according to a pre-Mother's Day study released Thursday by Salary.com, a...Mass. based firm that studies workplace compensation. The eighth annual survey calculated a mom's market value by studying pay levels for 10 job titles with duties that a typical mom performs, ranging from housekeeper and day care centre teacher to van driver, psychologist and chief executive officer. . .One stay-at-home mom said the six-figure salary sounds a little low. 'I think a lot of people think we sit and home and have a lot of fun and don't do a lot of work,' said Samantha Russell, a Fremont, N.H., mother who left her job as pastry chef to raise two boys, ages two and four. 'But they should try cleaning their house with little kids running around and messing it up right after them...Russell agreed her job as a stay-at-home mom is more than full-time. But she said her 'job' brings intangible benefits she wouldn't enjoy in the workplace. 'The rewards aren't monetary, but it's a reward knowing that they're safe and happy,' Russell said of her sons. 'It's worth it all.'" (AP, May 8, 2008)

* THE BEST GIFT FOR MOTHER:

One of the best gifts children can give their mother, is their obedience:

Proverbs 10:1. . .a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

Proverbs 23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise. . .
25. . .and she that bare thee shall rejoice.

Let husbands also praise a godly wife who is dedicated to the family. As men, we do not need another man in the house. Let us therefore not despise the differences in a dedicated wife. If her heart is toward her family, let us exalt her and honor her. And, as she has placed herself under our protection, in obedience to the Lord, let us cherish her and defend her unto death.

THE VANITY OF ABSTINENCE FROM PUBLIC EDUCATION WITHOUT ABSTINENCE FROM THE UNGODLY ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

Luke 17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

"A loose coalition of educators, politicians, textbook publishers, and researchers is devaluing traditional sexuality morality through their public support of homosexual relationships. In reaction, American Christians, observant Jews, Muslims, and others are joining Dobson in endorsing an exodus from public schools."
(Christianity Today, Editorial - September 9, 2002)

"In a riveting speech at the National Religious Broadcasters annual convention earlier this year, Focus on the Family's Dr. James Dobson asked the crowd of 3,500 people a provocative question about children: 'Do you understand what a stem cell is?...Do you understand that children are the stem cells for the culture? The environment that you put them in is what they grow up to be. And if you can control what they hear, if you could control what they're told, if you have access to their minds &amp; you can make them into just about whatever you want them to be.'....homosexual proselytizing has become so rampant and audacious in government schools that major cultural icons like Dr. Dobson and talk radio's Dr. Laura Schlessenger have publicly urged parents to simply remove their children from public schools...." (Commentary by David Kupelian, WorldNetDaily, November 12, 2002)

It is certainly good advice to call Christians to separate from public education. Too many people wrongly confuse "education" with "government controlled education." They are not the same. I am thankful that many Christians are awakening to the dangers of public schools. It is too bad that it took school shootings to stir many from their lethargy. However, fundamentalist Christians have been preaching FOR YEARS that the Biblical commands and warnings concerning separation should be enough to move parents to forsake public education for Christian schools or home-schooling. In response, the fundamentalists were often ignored by mainstream, evangelical Christians, and called names by liberals and unbelievers. For example, the fundamentalists in the 1970's who decried public education and labored for the deregulation of non-public schools in N.C. were sneeringly labeled "narrow-minded rednecks" by their opponents (see "Greensboro Record" in its lead editorial entitled "Deregulating The Schools," April 2, 1979). Yet, it is obvious today that the fundamentalists were right all along. The really sad thing is that a whole generation of children have been corrupted since the fundamentalists first sounded the alarm and were ignored by the liberals and the majority of Christians. The same pattern is being repeated today in regard to other crucial issues.

Fundamentalists are once again being ignored today in regard to Harry Potter, worldly television, and worldly movies in general. I often read or hear conservative Christian commentary wherein worldly movies (with bloody violence for entertainment, and/or unlawful sex, nakedness, blasphemy, cuss words, taking God's name in vain, etc.) are praised as long as they happen to have a "noble" theme, etc. The sad truth is, there are many Christians that are simply addicted to worldly movies. To them, only "fanatics" entirely forsake the world's theaters and television programs. As with public education a generation ago, they mock the fundamentalist call to totally separate from the world's vile entertainments and protect the precious children.

Thirty years from now, if the Lord tarries, will there be a mass call by popular talk-show conservatives to totally forsake the worldly movies? If so, it will again be thirty years too late for a whole generation of children. All that conservative leaders have written or spoken concerning public education applies in a greater degree to worldly movies. The same justifications are used with worldly movies as with public education: "There are some good teachers. There are some noble lessons on character, etc. We can change it from within. Grab some popcorn and let's see some violence. It will be good for the children to face reality. We can share the Gospel with the movie stars on the screen."

Today, in America, a person can drive for many hours up into the mountains (any mountain range, it makes no difference) and stop to eat in a small restaurant three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, only to be served by an immodest young girl with purple hair and an ear-ring in her nose! How can this be? On the roof of almost every mountain house or cabin in communities where hundreds are probably home-schooled (or at least have Christian school teachers) there is attached a satellite dish that pumps in the world's television filth right into the living room. In practically every hidden community, the mom and pop corner store advertises VCR's and video rentals for movies wherein perverts, fornicators, blasphemers and sodomites are the "stars." It is vain to call for an exodus from public schools without calling for an exodus from the world's entertainment industry. What a blessing it would be if some Christian leaders today would not wait thirty years to finally agree with the fundamentalists! A great number of children would be saved from Hollywood's ungodly agenda.

BIBLE METHODISTS STAND AGAINST TV

"Bro. Faust, I am a 20 yr old college student, currently in my third year of ministerial studies. I wish to respond to the statements of the young man, David, who addressed the worldly influence of today's entertainment industry through television and movies. In his letter, he made the following statement: "I am one of the few who have abandoned the entertainment industry of TV and movies for the sake of Christ." I, for one, applaud his Christ-honoring stand! However, I would also like to encourage him in the fact that he is not "one" of "few." There are many like-minded fundamentalist Christians who have taken the same stand. While we are not a Baptist, we are solidly within the realm of fundamentalism. I, as a Bible Methodist, have never had the influence of a television within my home. The Bible Methodist Connection of Independent Churches have long taken a stand against TV and theaters. All of the 50+ churches in our Alabama conferences are in support of the long-standing ban on television. Our other conferences, including Ohio and the Great Lakes Conference, support the same stand. The college that I am now attending does not permit television on campus, or in any of their staff housing. Other large fellowships of churches, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, the Bible Missionary Union and the Tennessee Bible Methodist Connection all have taken a strong stand against television and the theater. Our annual IHC convention, which is held in Dayton, OH, draws crowds of over 8,000. This convention, from its very beginning, has taken a position against TV that is maintained to this day. It encourages me to see our independent Baptist brethren raising the standard on this issue.
In closing, I would like to pose this question: If our fundamentalist churches can take positions on dress and other such lifestyle issues...why are many preachers afraid to touch issues such as entertainment? May the Lord bless you and your ministry! Yours for the cause of Christ."

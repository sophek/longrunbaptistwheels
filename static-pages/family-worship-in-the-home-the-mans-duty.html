        <h1>FAMILY WORSHIP IN THE HOME: THE MAN'S DUTY</h1>
        <div id="content">
            The man should be leading his home, and should not take a backseat in regard to holiness and Bible knowledge. Scriptures should be read and studied regularly in the home. There should be regular family prayer. The husband and wife should also interact regularly by discussing the Scriptures. The following Scriptures reveal that the man in the home is called to lead his wife and children spiritually:
<blockquote>1 Corinthians 14:35 And if they will LEARN any thing, let them ask their HUSBANDS at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ephesians 6:4 And, ye FATHERS, provoke not your children to wrath: BUT bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</blockquote>
<blockquote>1 Timothy 3:4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Genesis 18:18 Seeing that ABRAHAM shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 19 For I know him, that he will COMMAND his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Genesis 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 2 Then JACOB said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Deuteronomy 11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. 19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Joshua 24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and MY HOUSE, we will serve the LORD.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Psalms 78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should MAKE THEM KNOWN to their children:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Proverbs 4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a FATHER, and attend to know understanding.
3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Job 1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that JOB sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job CONTINUALLY.</blockquote>
It is the man's responsibility to gather the family together at the appropriate time for worship in the home. He must keep order during this sacred time. Therefore, the common excuse, "It is her fault that we don't have regular devotions in our home" is not justified. The man is the leader and he is responsible before the Lord to lead and rule his home. The wife is commanded to submit. The husband is commanded to love. In explaining this Biblical love, the Holy Spirit reveals that the husband's duty is to wash his wife with Scripture (Ephesians 5). To neglect to wash the wife with Scripture is as sinful as the wife refusing to obey her husband.

            "I see it publicly stated by men who call themselves Christian that it would be advisable for Christians to frequent the theatre, that the character of the drama might be raised. The suggestion is about as sensible as if we were bidden to pour a bottle of lavender water into the great sewer to improve its aroma. If the Church is to imitate the world in order to raise its tone, things have strangely altered since the day when our Lord said, 'Come ye out from among them, and touch not the unclean thing.'" (Spurgeon's "The Sword & Trowel," Sept. 1879) 

"(ABP) - On the heels of the Harry Potter movie, with magical themes that some criticize as unchristian, another popular fantasy novel is about to hit the big screen. The anticipated blockbuster 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is expected to take the already legendary renown of author J.R.R. Tolkien to another level. Scheduled to hit theaters Dec.19, it is the first installment of an ambitious attempt to translate Tolkien's classic 'Lord of the Rings' series in film...Tolkien's three-volume set has sold more than 50 million copies since publication of the first volume in 1954...Another question is how audiences that objected to mythical themes in Harry Potter will receive similar fare in Tolkien's writings. While Tolkien was politically conservative and a devout Christian, his works have been subject of broad interpretation by various groups. For example: Songs by the popular rock band Led Zeppelin in the 1970s borrowed images from Tolkien. The Hobbit habit of ingesting mushrooms and smoking 'pipe weed' got translated into drug use for counter-culture readers...Often overlooked, meanwhile, is the subtle Christian message underlying Tolkien's fiction. In fact, Tolkien persuaded C.S. Lewis, who himself later wrote several Christian classics, to become a Christian...Tolkien omitted overt references to God, worship, prayer and Christianity in the 500,000 words of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It wasn't an effort to hide his Christian faith, he said. Rather, he believed the technique communicated Christian values more effectively precisely because they were less obvious..." 

Comments: Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic. His books are witty and fascinating. However, they contain terrible errors. There is NO such thing as a Hobbit. But there IS such a thing as a WIZARD: 

Leviticus 19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after WIZARDS, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. 

The wizard in Tolkien's fantasy is a "good" wizard. The Bible teaches that in the last days, SORCERY (i.e. witchcraft) would be revived: 

Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their SORCERIES, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall come. 
5 Having a FORM OF GODLINESS, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
8 Now as JANNES and JABRES withstood Moses, so DO THESE ALSO resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 

Jannes and Jambres were WIZARDS: 

Exodus 7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the SORCERERS: now the MAGICIANS of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their ENCHANTMENTS. 

Therefore, the Bible predicts that in the last days SORCERY will be very prominent, but it will be cloaked in a form of godliness! Remember, the magicians in the day of Moses did not cause the plagues that the Lord sent to GO AWAY. The Bible says they actually brought MORE plagues and thereby helped CURSE Egypt!: 

Exodus 8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and BROUGHT UP FROGS upon the land of Egypt. 

So, we can expect in our day, a NEW AGE revival of sorcery that cloaks itself in Christianity! This is what J.K. Rowling's books are all about (i.e. Blavatsky's "Theosophy"). Rowling mentions Blavatsky in one of her books (though she slightly alters the spelling). With the "Star Wars' Force", Rowling's blatant witchcraft (soon to be merged with "Christianized," occult, Theosophical elements), and now the new Tolkien movie giving wizards a form of godliness, we are set to bring forth a generation of children ready to fulfill 2 Timothy 3 and Revelation 9:21! 

Woe to the Christian leaders and parents that will sugar-coat and promote this new revival of Christianized sorcery! On the authority of the Word of God, if they do not repent, they will be judged for these evil works: 

Luke 17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but WOE UNTO HIM, through whom they come! 
2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should OFFEND one of THESE LITTLE ONES.

Sound the alarm preachers! How about calling for some raised hands this Lord's Day? You might ask, 'Who will throw away the family TV when they get home from church and choose to stay out of the theater this new year?' 

And maybe there is a reader of this newsletter right now that has the holy fear of the Lord. Your spirit in stirred within you. You see what the Devil is doing; you see how he is destroying Christian families left and right and leading the whole world headlong into the bosom of the coming Antichrist. Will YOU make a decision this very minute to throw away the TV? If so, hit reply and tell me, so I can pray for you and thank God! Will you go to your family right now and bow your knees to the Lord and tell Him you are sorry for the things that you have allowed to be set before their eyes? Will you bring forth fruits meet for repentance? Will you tell the Lord that you and your family will not step foot back into a movie theater? Be strong and do it now in the Lord! Rejoice and be free. Let your moderation be known unto all men, the Lord is at hand! Please reply and let me know of your holy decision.

        <div id="content">
            <p>THE ARMINIANISM OF DANIEL D. CORNER REFUTED - Part 1:</p>
<p>Back in April, of last year (2005), I included a response to a review of my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" in the Kingdom Alert. The review was by Dr. Vic Reasoner of The Arminian Magazine. If you missed it, you may find the review, and my response, online:</p>
<p>( http://www.kingdombaptist.org/Viv_Reasoner.cfm )</p>
<p>Recently, I received in the mail a free copy of, "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted," by Daniel D. Corner. One of the Foreword's of this book is written by Dr. Vic Reasoner. He is a postmillennial preterist. Daniel Corner's book is 801 pages, and it was written in 2000 (a few years before my book was published). On his web site, Corner calls his book "The most exhaustive refutation to eternal security ever written!"</p>
<p>( http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/whatsnew.htm )</p>
<p>On this same web site, Mr. Corner has issued the following debate challenge:</p>
<p>"I, Dan Corner, openly challenge any and all qualified advocates of eternal security (also known as perseverance of the saints) to publicly debate this issue with me in a fair, equally timed exchange of ideas."</p>
<p>His challenge is insincere, and it is aimed only at those who are considered by Mr. Corner as easy targets (i.e. those who apply all the Biblical warnings to unbelievers or false professors). In such a debate, the "eternal security side" will list the eternal security verses, and he will simply cite the hundreds of verses that speak of punishment after death or at the Lord's return. But it is too bad for Mr. Corner that he seems to have forgotten that for 300 years the early Christians were premillennial! And the premillennial view of the Scriptures allows for an entire age to be inserted between the present age and the eternal age. Since this "world to come" (i.e. the Millennium) begins at the final stage of the Second Coming, Mr. Corner is left with the impossible task of proving that the warnings to disobedient believers in the Scriptures apply to the eternal age (beginning at the Great White Throne, after the Kingdom has been delivered up to the Father), and not to temporary punishments at the Judgment Seat of Christ and during the world to come (i.e. the Millennium). Mr. Corner, after studying the material in my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?," completely backed out of our debate (I had accepted his "challenge"). He stated that he does not debate pastors, authors and teachers who are AV Only (unless they promise to never raise a "translational issue" in the debate!). I even agreed to not allow the debate to get tangled up or distracted by such issues. However, it appears that Mr. Corner was only using this issue as a smokescreen.</p>
<p>In the past few years, there have been a number of reviews, critiques, and even a lengthy video by Jack Van Impe in response to "The Rod: Will God Spare It?". There have been "email bombs" and "email tirades" by some others; yet none of these could rightly be seen as an organized, public debate, where each side submits to equal time, and is unable to duck and evade issues easily. Why the silence? It cannot simply be that the issues I have raised are not important enough, or worth the time of these various scholars and teachers. The numerous reviews and critiques argue against such an answer. I can only conclude that it is easier to "review" a book or doctrine, than it is to defend one's review!:</p>
<p>Proverbs 18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</p>
<p>It is quite easy to simply inveigh against a doctrine, and then appear reasonable to one's own eyes. It is quite another thing to have one's objections "searched" and weighed. This is why open disputation can be so valuable; and this is why it was practiced so much by the early Apostles and other Christians (Acts 6:9, 9:29, 15:7, 17:17, 19:8-9).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since Mr. Corner refuses to debate, yet I have received a copy of his book, I will respond by examining it in light of the Scriptures. It is my prayer that the following series will edify and strengthen the faith of many in our gracious, merciful Lord, who loves every believer with an everlasting love.</p>

THE ARMINIANISM OF DANIEL D. CORNER REFUTED - Part 1:<br />
(BY JOEY FAUST)<br />
*******************************************************************</p>
<p>The following is a refutation of, "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted," by Daniel D. Corner (http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org).</p>
<p>The book begins with an introduction wherein Mr. Corner cites some letters from people who profess to have witnessed rotten fruit from eternal security in their children and friends. Of course, this is eternal security as it is taught in modern times, by many. Fifteen years of weekly street evangelism and neighborhood-door-knocking has likewise convinced me that something is greatly wrong with the doctrine of eternal security AS IT IS COMMONLY TAUGHT TODAY. Of course, it is not the doctrine of eternal security that is wrong; it is the fact that the true teaching concerning the Judgment Seat of Christ is watered-down or left out.</p>
<p>Mr. Corner is not even out of his Introduction (on page 3) and he already reveals the wrong assumption that has caused him to go astray doctrinally. He writes:</p>
<p>"One must wonder, how could such a teaching that would allow the unrepentant sexually immoral, drunkards, greedy, etc. into HEAVEN even exists when Paul, the real grace teacher, clearly said numerous times such won't inherit the KINGDOM OF GOD (1 Cor. 6:9,10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:5-7)?"</p>
<p>Mr. Corner is not able to find the word "heaven" used anywhere near the texts he cites. He pulled the word out of thin air and inserted it into the text. To start with, Jesus will come TO EARTH to reign for 1000-years at His Second Coming. After this Millennial Kingdom, the Bible teaches that New Jerusalem will descend down from God OUT OF HEAVEN, and the tabernacle of God will be WITH MEN and He will dwell with them eternally:</p>
<p>Revelation 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming DOWN from God OUT OF HEAVEN, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br />
3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and HE WILL DWELL WITH THEM, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</p>
<p>Mr. Corner is also wrong in using the phrase "the Kingdom of God," as it appears in the verses he lists (1. Cor. 6, Gal. 5, Eph. 5), as a synonym for "heaven" (by which we assume he means "everlasting life" or the eternal age). Did he not read how the phrase "the kingdom" is used by Paul (when speaking of the eschatological kingdom) in 1 Corinthians 15?:</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.<br />
24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up THE KINGDOM to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.<br />
25 For HE MUST REIGN, TILL he hath put all enemies under his feet.<br />
26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
<p>The "kingdom" is the Millennium in 1 Corinthians 15. It is the kingdom that is established at the Lord's coming:</p>
<p>2 Timothy 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p>It lasts 1000-years, and then it is delivered up to the Father:</p>
<p>Revelation 20:6...they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall REIGN with him a thousand years.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:25 For HE MUST REIGN, TILL he hath put all enemies under his feet.</p>
<p>J. Frank Norris, on this verse, writes:</p>
<p>"The Scriptures teach (1) That Christ will return to the earth in Person, and (2) Establish His kingdom on the earth, and (3) Reign until He has put all enemies under His feet...'For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.' It is very clear in this passage...that our Lord Jesus is represented as administering the affairs of this world as King, and when He has finished then He delivers the kingdom up to God. The allusion here is to a Roman viceroy or governor of provinces, who, when their administration was ended, delivered up their kingdom or government into the hands of the emperor...The early church for 300 years believed in the Premillennial coming of Jesus Christ...Mosheim, perhaps the greatest church historian, says, 'The prevailing opinion that Christ was to come and reign a thousand years among men before the final dissolution of the world, had met with no opposition until the time of Origen."<br />
("The Norris-Hines Debate," 1946)</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Corner has barely even started, and he has already revealed a major reason for his confusion. He thinks that the "kingdom of God" in Paul's Epistles is HEAVEN, when it is plainly the Millennial Kingdom established at Christ's future coming! Corner has, perhaps unknowingly, adopted Augustine's view (or the Popish view) of the "kingdom" in the Epistles. This view, beginning with Origen, departed from three-hundred years of premillennial doctrine that was embraced by the early Christians, including the Apostles.</p>
<p>Therefore, so far, all Corner has revealed is that some believers who fall into immoralities, etc., and do not repent, will not inherit the Millennial Kingdom. What does this have to do with ETERNAL security? The Millennium is in time. It is not the eternal state.</p>
<p>Corner writes:</p>
<p>"One must also ask, whatever happened to the stress on fearing God and holy living?" (p.6).</p>
<p>I wonder the same thing. But what does this really have to do with eternal security? The fact that so many have gladly embraced eternal security, while neglecting the Lord's warnings concerning the Judgment Seat of Christ (and His commands for holiness), only reveals that these warnings need to be taught and preached with all long-suffering and doctrine. But Corner is not teaching these warnings. In fact, he has fallen through the floor! He is off the foundation. He appears to only see TWO ages (i.e. this present age and the eternal age), but the Bible speaks of THREE ages (i.e. this present age; the coming Millennial age; and the eternal age).</p>
<p>Corner writes:</p>
<p>"In the same way, to accept eternal security as truth will behaviorally affect you to some degree." (p. 7).</p>
<p>Corner has missed the fact that, although the streets are indeed filled with drunkards who use eternal security (without warnings) as an excuse to sin, they are ALSO filled with drunkards who profess to believe in conditional security (loss of salvation)! I invite him to come with us any weekend, and he will see this to be true in half an hour. And I believe it is possible that we will find more drunkards who reject eternal security than those who embrace it. However, I do agree that mere eternal security, without the Bible's warnings, is incomplete and imbalanced.</p>
<p>But Corner's statement misses an important truth. Love is a strong motivation for believers in the Bible. Paul beseeches believers by [on the basis of] the mercies of God (Romans 12:1). The "love of Christ constraineth us" (2 Corinthians 5:14). I often ask "Arminians" which gift would cause us to see God's love for us in a greater manner (and thus break our hearts, and provoke us to gratitude), a gift that we can forfeit once we possess it, or a gift that we can never forfeit? Would not an adopted son see the love of his new father more if his father told him that he would always be his son unconditionally, regardless of his conduct? Would not his heart burn within him if he was told that, although there are high standards and severe discipline in the household, there is also unconditional love?:</p>
<p>Psalms 89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.<br />
29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.<br />
30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;<br />
31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;<br />
32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.<br />
33 NEVERTHELESS MY LOVINGKINDNESS WILL I NOT UTTERLY TAKE FROM HIM, nor suffer MY FAITHFULNESS to fail.</p>
<p>It is a very sad thing for Arminians that they do not know for sure that they will endure until the end and not end up an enemy of God eternally. It is very sad that they have never experienced what it means to be eternally loved on the basis of the faithfulness of Christ, and not our own works. (Hyper-Calvinists also have a similar problem. They do not know for sure that five years from now they will not fall into "habitual sin" and thus prove to all - according to their view - that all along they have been only false professors with a false, temporary faith. They may say that they trust God that this will not be the case. But false professors can say the same thing. They really will not be able to know for sure until the end of their lives - and yet, since God does not see as man sees - they really cannot know that they have "endured until the end" until they stand before God. In this, Arminians and hyper-Calvinists meet together). It is sad that Arminians have never known the motivation that comes from understanding that God has blessed us with a free gift that cannot be lost.</p>
<p>I have heard the replies that are made to these arguments. But in spite of them all, Corner must confess that a gift that cannot be lost is a GREATER GIFT. Therefore, since we love God because He first loved us, it is a serious thing to lessen this gift by confusing it with the prize! The prize may be forfeited. But the gift is secure. God has wisely granted us two motivations. He has given us a gift that is so wonderful, it cannot be lost, since the Blood of Jesus will never lose its worth! Yet, we also have before us a prize, and warnings associated with it. And this prize can be lost, and there is much to fear.</p>
<p>Arminianism weakens the constraining power of love, by robbing the professing believer of the doctrine of God's unconditional, everlasting, unfailing love. It must "argue around" scores of verses. Yet, when the warnings are rightly applied to the Judgment Seat and the Millennium, the promises of eternal security are left free to work their own motivations in the life of the believer. Horatius Bonar reproved such teachings over a century ago:</p>
<p>"The teaching of some in the present day seems fitted, that of others intended, to hinder assurance. Assurance, say some, is impossible. Not impossible, say others, but very hard of attainment; not only very hard, but very long of being reached, requiring at least some thirty or forty years of prayer and good works. Very dangerous, say others, introducing presumption, and sure to end in apostasy. I confess I do not see how my being thoroughly persuaded that a holy God loves me with a holy love, and has forgiven me all my sins, has a tendency to evil (even though I may have reached that conclusion quickly.) It seems, of all truths, one of the likeliest to make me holy, to kindle love, to stimulate to good works, and to abase all pride; whereas uncertainty in this matter enfeebles me, darkens me, bewilders me, incapacitates me for service or, at the best, sets me striving to work my way into the favor of God, under the influence of a subordinate and mercenary class of motives, which can do nothing but keep me dreading and doubting all the days of my life, leaving me, perhaps, at the close, in hopeless darkness."<br />
(Horatius Bonar, "God's Way of Holiness")</p>
<p>Mr. Corner closes his introduction with the following words:</p>
<p>"'The Believer's Conditional Security' maintains that we are saved by grace, salvation is a gift, eternal life comes instantly the moment we truly believe on Jesus for salvation, and righteousness is imputed by our faith in Christ." (p.8)</p>
<p>Corner's idea of "grace" would be like me "GRACIOUSLY" offering him $200 IF he will embrace eternal security AND NEVER TURN BACK AGAIN TO ARMINIANISM. It has strings attached. In contrast to Corner's idea of "grace" and a "gift," God gives eternal salvation to all believers on the basis of the works of Christ! It is a salvation that has already been purchased by the merit and atoning Blood of Jesus. How then, can works ever play a part in such grace? Corner reveals that he has a very dangerous, improper understanding of the Gospel and its redemption. Eternal salvation is not of works. It is not given on the basis of past works (at least not our works), or present works, or future works! Once possessed, it does not have to be maintained, kept, polished or anything else to be genuine.</p>
<p>In fact, true faith is knowing that you are eternal secure by the Blood of Jesus that has been shed for your sins! If you do not know that you are eternally secure (and will always be), then you have not yet properly trusted in Jesus (unless you once believed you were secure in the past, but were later robbed of it by false teaching or reasoning). It is therefore crucial that you fully rest in the finished, completed work of Christ, and do not rely upon your own merits - even those that you give God the glory for working in you!</p>
<p>Mr. Corner teaches that men, though regenerated by faith, are ultimately secure through enduring to the end in the righteousness that the Holy Spirit desires to work in the submissive believer. By adopting Augustine's view of the kingdom in the Epistles (i.e. or a view similar - that it is not the Millennial Kingdom to be established at the return of Christ), he has been led right into the similar error of Augustine in regard to the Gospel and salvation. Although he rejects Augustine's "Calvinism" and baptismal regeneration, etc., his insertion of "heaven" for the kingdom has caused him to adopt a salvation that is kept only by refraining from the sins that Paul teaches will cause believers to not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>

THE ARMINIANISM OF DANIEL D. CORNER REFUTED - Part 2:<br />
(BY JOEY FAUST)<br />
***********************************************************************</p>
<p>The following is a refutation of, "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted," by Daniel D. Corner (http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org).</p>
<p>In Part I, I examined Mr. Corner's Introduction (his chapter 1). I pointed out that it only took a few pages for him to reveal the main reason behind much of his doctrinal confusion. He thinks that the phrase "kingdom of God," (etc.), means "heaven," and he uses "heaven" as a synonym for life in the eternal age. This is part of that old confusion started by Origen (i.e. allegorical interpretation) and Tyconius (typological), that later influenced Augustine; it has practically taken over the Christian denominations in modern times. It is therefore interesting that Corner writes against Origen and Augustine in his book. He is somehow unaware of how much he has in common with these writers!</p>
<p>Based on the Scriptures and debates in Christian history, it is amazing that Corner does not offer any proof for his view that the phrase "kingdom of God," (etc.) refers to Heaven or the eternal state. He answers no objections to his view. The word "kingdom" is not found in the Subject Index of his 801-page book. Yet, most of the arguments of his book are based on Scriptures that teach exclusion from the "kingdom"! I have carefully studied (with pen in hand) every page of his book. He never offers the slightest discussion or evidence to prove his view of the kingdom! Furthermore, his Scripture Index omits 1 Corinthians 15:24-26. These verses are significant since they reveal the very manner in which Paul uses the phrase "the kingdom," and they reveal that the "kingdom" is the temporary, Millennial Kingdom in most verses. Corner makes much of Paul's warnings about exclusion from the kingdom (and from the inheritance in/of the kingdom) to argue against eternal security. Why then, in 801 pages, does he fail to present even the slightest proof for his views concerning the kingdom?</p>
<p>While Corner falls very short of proving Arminianism, he certainly reveals many errors and weaknesses of Calvinism's fifth point (the perseverance of the saints). He certainly reveals that there is something missing, and much that is terribly wrong in the manner in which "once-saved-always-saved" is being taught in pulpits today. It is too bad that Corner, who appears to be premillennial, interprets so many Scriptures in an amillennial or postmillennial fashion! This leaves him with no other way to understand the warnings to Christians than to apply them to the eternal age; this ends up in a works salvation, and a denial of grace. Corner's only answer to this dilemma is to say that we must be wrong in our understanding of grace and works! Modern eternal security advocates would rather err on the side of grace, even if they cannot explain many of the various warnings. Yet Corner would rather apply the warnings to the eternal state - even if he has to teach eternal salvation by working to the end, with no certain assurance! This is fleeing licentiousness only to fall into the arms of Roman Catholicism. Is it reasonable to rail against Millennial Exclusion as resembling Purgatory, while one embraces Rome's "gospel" of eternal salvation by works (which is no Gospel!)?</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Corner begins by noting two positions among advocates of eternal security. He calls those who believe that every true saint will persevere in practical holiness the "moderate" position; and he calls those who believe that true saints can be carnal and "walk as men," and end up "unfruitful" (though saved at last), the "extreme" position. Corner notes that both positions agree that true saints can never lose ultimate, eternal salvation.</p>
<p>His main point in Chapter 2 is his argument that once-saved-always-saved (OSAS) began with Augustine (354-430). Since Augustine was heretical in many places, and a principle father of the Roman Catholic Church, Corner argues that eternal security must therefore be wrong. He writes:</p>
<p>"...did you know that it [OSAS]...can be traced more than one thousand years earlier [than Calvin] to Augustine of Hippo (354-430)?...Augustine was most importantly wrong about the foremost doctrine in all of Scripture - how to be saved...Augustine, then, was spiritually incapable of correctly understanding Scripture." (pp.20, 31).</p>
<p>It is certainly true that Augustine was in great error, and should not be trusted as a worthy teacher of Scriptures. But Corner needs to realize that his argument of "guilt by association" actually bites his own hand! Augustine confessed that he had abandoned the premillennial view that had been strongly advocated by the Christians before him. Justin Martyr had called premillennialism (i.e. chiliasm) the view held by all the right-minded Christians in his early day! In contrast to this view, Augustine later adopted a figurative, and/or extremely typological manner of interpreting the Scriptures. In his "City of God," he writes:</p>
<p>"Those who, on the strength of this passage [Revelation 20], have suspected that the first resurrection is future and bodily, have been moved, among other things, specially by the number of a thousand years, as if it were a fit thing that the saints should thus enjoy a kind of Sabbath-rest during that period...there should follow on the completion of six thousand years, as of six days, a kind of seventh-day Sabbath in the succeeding thousand years; and that it is for this purpose the saints rise, viz., to celebrate this Sabbath. And. this opinion would not be objectionable, if it were believed that the joys of the saints in that Sabbath shall be spiritual, and consequent on the presence of God; for I MYSELF, TOO, ONCE HELD THIS OPINION. But, as they assert that those who then rise again shall enjoy the leisure of immoderate carnal banquets, furnished with an amount of meat and drink such as not only to shock the feeling of the temperate, but even to surpass the measure of credulity itself, such assertions can be believed only by the carnal. They who do believe them are called by the spiritual Chiliasts, which we may literally reproduce by the name Millenarians." (Augustine)</p>
<p>Of course, the early Christians did not believe, as Augustine implied, that the future Millennium would be "carnal" or ungodly. They rightly believed that it would be contrasted to this present time of temptation and suffering. It will be characterized as a time of joy, as opposed to this time of cross bearing. It is a time of reigning, as opposed to this time of suffering (2 Timothy 2:12, Luke 22:28-29). Augustine was simply reflecting (and watering) the growing asceticism of his day in preparation for Rome's later monkery, etc.</p>
<p>This change in Augustine's doctrinal view of Revelation 20 colored his whole understanding of the kingdom; and this, in turn, affected his understanding of the Gospel. David R. Anderson writes:</p>
<p>"...when Augustine became amillennial, this major change in his eschatology affected other parts of his theology, namely his soteriology...That chiliasm was the norm in eschatology up until roughly A.D. 400 is no debate among church historians."<br />
("The Soteriological Impact of Augustine's Change from Premillenialism to Amillennialism, Part One; 2002; Faithalone.org)</p>
<p>In 1995, I argued a similar point in an article titled, "Purgatory! The Baby with the Bath Water." I showed from Augustine's work, "Enchiridion," that his new view of the "kingdom" warped his view of eternal salvation. "Enchiridion" is a later work of Augustine, after he rejected premillennialism. He equates "the kingdom" in 1 Corinthians 6:9 with eternal salvation, in the eternal state, instead of matching it with the temporary kingdom that Paul goes on to discuss in 1 Corinthians 15. Augustine writes:</p>
<p>"But now, can that part of the human race to whom God hath promised deliverance and a place in the ETERNAL KINGDOM be restored through the merits of their own works?"<br />
("Enchiridion," Chapter 9)</p>
<p>Notice that Augustine here defines what he means by the phrase "the kingdom" whenever it is found in this work. To Augustine, at this point in his life, the "kingdom" refers to eternal life, in an eternal kingdom in Heaven. Notice his commentary on 1 Corinthians 3 and 6 in a later chapter:</p>
<p>"There are some, indeed, who believe that those who do not abandon the name of Christ, and who are baptized in his laver in the Church, who are not cut off from it by schism or heresy, who may then live in sins however great, not washing them away by repentance, nor redeeming them by alms - and who obstinately persevere in them to life's last day - even these will still be saved, 'though as by fire.' They believe that such people will be punished by fire, prolonged in proportion to their sins, but still not eternal...Now, if the wicked man were to be saved by fire on account of his faith only, and if this is the way the statement of the blessed Paul should be understood - 'But he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire' - then faith WITHOUT WORKS would be sufficient to salvation. But then what the apostle James said would be false. And also false would be another statement of the same Paul himself: 'Do not err,' he says; 'neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the unmanly, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit THE KINGDOM of God.' Now, if those who persist in such crimes as these are nevertheless saved by their faith in Christ, would they not then be in THE KINGDOM of God?"<br />
(Chapter 13)</p>
<p>Notice, he argues against Christians with great sins being punished at the Judgment Seat of Christ (but still saved) by referring to the fact that Paul said those with great sins would be excluded from "the Kingdom." Since Augustine no longer believed in a literal, future Millennial Kingdom of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:25, Revelation 20:6), he was forced to interpret the verses that teach exclusion from the kingdom as referring to exclusion from eternal life in the eternal kingdom.</p>
<p>But this teaching brought him into conflict with 1 Corinthians 3:15:</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>
<p>If a man's whole work on the foundation for Christ is burned, and yet he is still saved after suffering loss, yet so as by fire, why then does the Bible teach that elsewhere (according to Augustine) that great sinners will be excluded from the eternal kingdom? Rather than question his view of the kingdom, Augustine adopts an absurd interpretation. He teaches that the man in 1 Corinthians 3 is "burned" by certain desires in this life, as he holds on to Christ (the foundation), and will therefore be saved, since he did not let go of the foundation. He writes:</p>
<p>"In fact, wood and hay and stubble may be understood, without absurdity, to signify such an attachment to those worldly things - albeit legitimate in themselves - that one cannot suffer their loss without anguish in the soul. Now, when such anguish 'burns,' and Christ still holds his place as foundation in the heart - that is, if nothing is preferred to him and if the man whose anguish 'burns' would still prefer to suffer loss of the things he greatly loves than to lose Christ - then one is saved, 'by fire.' But if, in time of testing, he should prefer to hold onto these temporal and worldly goods rather than to Christ, he does not have him as foundation - because he has put 'things' in the first place - whereas in a building nothing comes before the foundations. The fire is a sort of trial of affliction...This kind of fire works in the span of this life...He 'burns' with grief, for the things he has loved and lost, but this does not subvert nor consume him..."<br />
(Chapter 13)</p>
<p>Therefore, according to Augustine, one will be eternally saved only if he endures to the end, holding on to Christ during times of testing. Perhaps feeling a bit ashamed at the reckless confusion caused by such an interpretation, Augustine goes on to suggest the possibility that the suffering of loss may be future:</p>
<p>"It is not incredible that something like this should occur after this life, whether or not it is a matter for fruitful inquiry. It may be discovered or remain hidden whether some of THE FAITHFUL are sooner or later to be saved by a sort of purgatorial fire, in proportion as they have loved the goods that perish, and in proportion to their attachment to them. HOWEVER, this does not apply to those of whom it was said, 'They shall not possess the KINGDOM of God,' unless their crimes are remitted through due repentance. I say 'due repentance' to signify that they must not be barren of almsgiving, on which divine Scripture lays so much stress that our Lord tells us in advance that, on the bare basis of fruitfulness in alms, he will impute merit to those on his right hand; and, on the same basis of unfruitfulness, demerit to those on his left - when he shall say to the former, 'Come, blessed of my Father, receive the KINGDOM,' but to the latter, 'Depart into everlasting fire.'"<br />
(Chapter 13)</p>
<p>His suggestion of a possible "purgatorial fire" (after death) is only for the "faithful." In other words, it is only for those who did not commit sins worthy of exclusion from the kingdom, and for those who have brought forth fruits meet for repentance, through alms, etc. This is plainly eternal salvation by grace through works! The foundation for Rome's Purgatory is laid, and it is only for those with LESSER sins, not great (mortal). Like Augustine, Pope Gregory the Great later taught:</p>
<p>"That we believe that for CERTAIN SLIGHT SINS there will be a purgatory fire prior to judgment."</p>
<p>Those with "great" sins will be eternally damned. Rome's Purgatory not only allows eternal salvation to be purchased by suffering after death, it is also only for "slight" sins. According to Rome's "fathers," greater sins, such as those mentioned in the kingdom-exclusion passages (e.g. 1 Corinthians 6, Galatians 5 and Ephesians 5, etc.), will cause one to become eternally lost.</p>
<p>In bringing all this back to Daniel Corner, Augustine's views of the kingdom, the kingdom-warning passages, dead faith, enduring to the end, holding on to Christ, no real assurance, etc., all sound like Corner's own writings! Nevertheless, Mr. Corner tells us that Augustine is spiritually blind and therefore should be rejected!</p>
<p>Corner claims that Augustine was the originator of the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints (OSAS). He shows the influence that Augustine had on Calvin. However, he forgets that he also argues that Augustine is seen by many to be the father of Roman Catholicism! Rome denies the doctrine of eternal security with anathemas (Trent). Corner even provides quotes noting how all of Rome's errors can be traced back to Augustine. He is correct. He simply does not realize that Rome's "conditional security" is also one of these errors!</p>
<p>Augustine, contrary to Corner's assertions, did not believe in eternal security:</p>
<p>"Augustine said the non-elect can have genuine faith. Augustine said the non-elect can be legitimately regenerated by the Holy Spirit. But because they have not received that most necessary of all gifts, the gift of perseverance, these regenerated believers are non-elect. Forget the fact that the Scriptures never suppose that one who is regenerated is not also elect (cf. 1 Pet 1:1, 3 and Titus 1:1; 3:5). When pressed on this matter, as previously stated, Augustine explained this contradiction as 'a mystery.'"<br />
(Anderson, "The Soteriological Impact of Augustine's Change from Premillenialism to Amillennialism, Part Two; 2002; Faithalone.org)</p>
<p>Anderson is correct. Notice the following statements from Augustine's "On the Gift of Perseverance" (A.D. 429). Corner quoted extensively from this writing of Augustine. But he left out the following statements:</p>
<p>"Therefore it is uncertain whether any one has received this gift so long as he is still alive...if he have righteousness, if patience, if EVEN FAITH, and FALL AWAY, he is rightly said to have HAD these virtues and to HAVE THEM NO LONGER; for he was continent, or he was RIGHTEOUS, or he was patient, or HE WAS BELIEVING, as long as he was so; but when he ceased to be so, he no longer is what he was...If from the time at which any one became a believer he has lived - for the sake of argument - ten years, and in the midst of them has FALLEN FROM THE FAITH, has he not persevered for five years? I am not contending about words. If it be thought that this also should be called perseverance, as it were for so long as it lasts, assuredly he is not to be said to have had in any degree that perseverance of which WE ARE NOW DISCOURSING, by which one perseveres in Christ even to the end." (Augustine)</p>
<p>Notice, Augustine does not deny that some true believers will fail to endure until the end in faith and holiness; he simply states that he does not recognize such believers to have had the gift of perseverance in the way he is using the term. He holds that certain believers obtain a second work of grace, beyond initial regeneration. He continues:</p>
<p>"And the believer of one year, or of a period as much shorter as may be conceived of, if he has lived faithfully until he died, has rather had this perseverance than the believer of many years' standing, if a little time before his death he has fallen away from the STEDFASTNESS OF HIS FAITH...Let not men say, then, that perseverance is given to any one to the end, except when the end itself has come, and he to whom it has been given has been found to have persevered unto the end..." (Augustine)</p>
<p>In this quote on absolute assurance, we see that both Protestant Calvinism and Arminianism meet together in this root of Augustine. The debate between them is simply over whether or not the first faith that later does not endure was a "true" faith. Augustine teaches the same thing that Corner has argued in his book. Only, in this treatise, Augustine would add that the believers who finally fall away and are eternally lost did not seek (or obtain by God's grace) the extra gift of perseverance. He writes:</p>
<p>"And this might have been given to us even without our praying for it, but by our prayer He willed us to be admonished from whom we receive these benefits...Let the inquirer still go on, and say, 'Why is it that to some who have in good faith worshipped Him He has not given to persevere to the end?' Why except because he does not speak falsely who says, 'They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, doubtless they would have continued with us.' [1 John ii. 19]...Were not both created by God - both born of Adam - both made from the earth...Lastly, had not BOTH BEEN CALLED, and followed Him that called them? and had not both become, from wicked men, JUSTIFIED MEN, and both been RENEWED by the laver of regeneration?" (Augustine)</p>
<p>Augustine's theology states that a man can be called, justified, with fruits following, renewed through baptism, and yet not obtain the extra gift of perseverance. This is why we say that Corner's statements about Augustine (e.g. "Augustine, then, was spiritually incapable of understanding Scripture," p.31) actually rebukes his own view! Augustine continues:</p>
<p>"...But it is said, 'It is by his own fault that any one deserts the faith, when he yields and consents to the temptation which is the cause of his desertion of the faith.' Who denies it?...Because no one can be certain of the life eternal which God who does not lie has promised to the children of promise before the times of eternity, - no one, unless that life of his, which is a state of trial upon the earth, is completed." (Augustine)</p>
<p>As we have noted, Corner traces a line from Augustine to Calvin to John Macarthur. (Indeed, John Macarthur gladly admits that both he and Augustine teach the same view of salvation assurance. See, "The Gospel According to Jesus, p.222) Corner writes:</p>
<p>"In fact, John Calvin called Augustine...'the best and most faithful witness of all antiquity.'"(p.32)</p>
<p>Corner adds:</p>
<p>"One must wonder how his writings could be so exalted by the Reformers." (p.32)</p>
<p>Actually, the view that the Reformers exalted Augustine is not exactly true. Notice the following statements by Philipp Melancthon (1497-1560):</p>
<p>"'I see,' writes Melancthon, 'what is troubling you about faith. You stick to the FANCY OF AUGUSTINE, who, though right in rejecting the righteousness of human reason, imagines that we are justified by that fulfilling of the law which the Holy Spirit works in us. So you imagine that men are justified by faith, because it is by faith that we receive the Spirit, that thereafter we may be able to be just by that fulfillment of the law which the Spirit works. This imagination places justification in our fulfillment of the law, in our purity or perfection, although this renewal ought to follow faith. But do you turn your eyes from that renewal, and from the law altogether, to the promise and to Christ, and think that it is on Christ's account that we become just, that is, accepted before God, and that it is thus we obtain peace of conscience, and not on account of that renewal. For even this renewing is insufficient (for justification). We are justified by faith alone, not because it is a root, as you write, but because it apprehends Christ, on account of whom we are accepted. This renewing, although it necessarily follows, yet does not pacify the conscience. Therefore not even love, though it is the fulfilling of the law, justifies, but only faith; not because it is some excellence in us, but only because it takes hold of Christ. We are justified, not on account of love, not on account of the fulfilling of the law, not on account of our renewal, although these are the gifts of the Holy Spirit, but on account of Christ; and Him we take hold of by faith alone...Believe me, my Brentius, this controversy regarding the righteousness which is by faith is a mighty one, and little understood. You can only rightly comprehend it by turning your eyes entirely away from the law, and FROM AUGUSTINE'S IDEA about our fulfilling the law, and by fixing them wholly upon the free promise, so as to see that it is on account of that promise and for Christ's sake, that we are justified, that is, accepted and obtain peace. When could the conscience have peace and assured hope, if we are not justified till our renewal is perfected? What is this but to be justified by the law, and not by the free promise? In that discussion I said that to ascribe our justification to love is to ascribe it to our own work, understanding by that, a work done in us by the Holy Ghost. For faith justifies, not because it is a new work of the Spirit in us, but because it apprehends Christ, on account of whom we are accepted, and not on account of the gifts of the Holy Spirit in us. TURN AWAY FROM AUGUSTINE'S IDEA, and you will easily see the reason for this...'"<br />
(Melancthon, quoted in Horatius Bonar's, "God's Way of Holiness")</p>
<p>Here we see that Melancthon denied that Augustine even understood the Gospel! Historian D'Aubigne called Melancthon "the Theologian of the Reformation." We do not have to agree with everything the Protestant Reformers advocated to wonder how Mr. Corner could reprove them for being influenced by Augustine, when he also has so much in common with him. If Melancthon was alive today, he would rightly reprove Mr. Corner for being blinded by Augustine's "fancy"!</p>
<p>It appears that Corner is confused about the distinction between imputed righteousness and infused righteousness. Corner believes a Christian's IMPUTED righteousness can be destroyed by sin. He makes no distinction between a believer's position in Christ, based on imputed righteousness, and the believer's WALK in Christ, based on His infused righteousness in our practical lives. Corner writes:</p>
<p>"While it's certainly true that we are imputed a righteous standing before God through our faith in Christ, this righteous standing can be destroyed by sin." (p.194)</p>
<p>This is Augustine's old error, and Corner tells us that Augustine was spiritually blind.</p>

THE ARMINIANISM OF DANIEL D. CORNER REFUTED - Part 3:<br />
(BY JOEY FAUST)<br />
***********************************************************************</p>
<p>[The following is a refutation of, "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted," by Daniel D. Corner (http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org).]</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of Corner's book is called "Calvin's Dark Side." It documents Geneva's execution of Michael Servetus for doctrinal reasons (in 1553). As Servetus cried out for mercy, he was burned slowly with half-green wood. Corner reveals from John Calvin's own writings that Calvin (1509-1564) was involved in this decision, and never repented of it publicly. Calvin wrote:</p>
<p>"Servetus suffered the penalty due to his heresies, but was it my will? Certainly his arrogance destroyed him not less than his impiety. And what crime was it of mine if our council, AT MY EXHORTATION, INDEED, but in conformity with the opinion of several Churches, took vengeance on his execrable blasphemies?...posterity owes me a debt of gratitude for having purged the Church of so pernicious a monster." [Cited from Schaff, "History of the Christian Church," Vol. VIII, pp. 690, 691.]</p>
<p>Calvin had privately threatened to execute him seven years before his arrest at Geneva. He wrote in 1546:</p>
<p>"Servetus lately wrote to me, and coupled with his letter a long volume of his delirious fancies, with the Thrasonic boast, that I should see something astonishing and unheard of. He takes it upon him to come hither, if it be agreeable to me. But I am unwilling to pledge my word for his safety; for if he shall come, I shall never permit him to depart alive, provided my authority be of any avail." [Cited from Henry C. Sheldon, "History of the Christian Church," Vol. 3, p.159.]</p>
<p>Corner answers the common excuses used to justify Calvin's actions. He could have added that a child was beheaded in Calvin's Geneva for striking a parent; and in 1547 a man named Gruet was executed (after being tortured for three years) for simply placing a disrespectful placard on Calvin's pulpit.</p>
<p>But why does Corner remind us of this history? Corner's argument is that the doctrine of "once-saved-always-saved" is related to Calvinism's "perseverance of the saints." And since Calvin was a murderer who never repented, Corner argues that this must prove that his whole theological system is erroneous and spiritually darkened:</p>
<p>"Like it or not, the Scriptures lead to the conclusion that John Calvin's heart was not spiritually enlightened, but rather darkened as a result of his murderous hate for Servetus. Calvin was, therefore, spiritually incapable of rightly dividing the word of truth." (Corner, p. 44)</p>
<p>Calvinism's doctrine of "final perseverance" is not exactly "eternal security," since one would have to live one's whole life to absolutely know that one was indeed elect, and therefore "secure." Therefore, exposing Calvin is not the same as refuting the doctrine of eternal security.</p>
<p>But aside from this point, it is amazing that Corner does not realize that his argument, once again, cuts down his own tree! We simply have to notice that the worst murders for "heresy" in all of history were carried about by Roman Catholics; and Roman Catholics have always considered eternal security to be a damnable doctrine! We therefore can conclude that since Roman Catholics are "spiritually incapable of rightly dividing the word of truth," their doctrine of conditional security must be wrong! Would Corner like to compare the number of murders and tortures committed by Protestant Calvinists with those committed by Catholics? He will find that those who have embraced conditional security have murdered millions more than Protestant Calvinists ever murdered. And I think he would look hard to even find one murderer - especially one who murdered for heresy - among the advocates of eternal security (as contrasted to the Protestant advocates of "the perseverance of the saints"). Yet, as we have seen, even if we claimed Calvin as our own, Corner's conditional security would still come up with the short end of the stick, since it has the Catholic Inquisition on its side!</p>
<p>Corner takes some time in this chapter to argue that Calvin's perseverance of the saints is a license for immorality. He quotes the Westminster Confession to prove that Calvinists believe a saved person remains saved even if he falls into grievous sins and continues therein "for a time." Throughout his book, Corner often stresses this point with quotes from John Macarthur and others. The time period for continuing in grievous sins, yet remaining "sure" of election, is undefined by most Calvinists (David went almost a year before repenting of murder and adultery). Yet, advocates of Calvin's "perseverance" doctrine (in all its brands) believe that the "eternally elect" can fall into such sins as adultery, murder, drunkenness, fornication, etc., for "a time," as long as they do not continue therein for "too long." New Versions have even incorporated this teaching into text (in Hebrews and 1 John, etc.). The problem (noted by Corner throughout his book) is that, according to this doctrine, a true believer may technically live in adultery for at least nine months without repenting (like David), and yet die and "go to glory," and later come back with Christ in resurrection glory. Many of the most ardent "anti-carnal Christian" teachers hold this "nine month" (or however long they define it) loop-hole.</p>
<p>I must admit that Corner is correct in some of his assertions concerning this doctrine of the perseverance of the saints as it is commonly presented by Calvinists and Lordship Salvationists. As much as they decry the reality of a "carnal Christian," they must make room for such things as David's sin, and the denial of Christ by the disciples, etc. Therefore, they end up teaching that the most wicked sins can be committed by believers without any fear of hell or death at the Second Coming - as long as it is not continued in for "too long" (which, according to them, would cast doubt on their election). But since the time period for continuing in such sins is undefined, and left to the whim of every preacher, this often becomes a license for sin.</p>
<p>The remedy for this license is not Arminianism; it is the true doctrine of Millennial exclusion and temporary punishment at the Judgment Seat of Christ. This doctrine maintains that believers cannot commit grievous sins for any period and be free from the threat of death in this life and at the Judgment Seat of Christ. It closes the gap. It teaches that lesser sins will lower our position in the Millennial Kingdom (Matthew 5:19), and greater ones will exclude us altogether (Matthew 5:20, 18:3,6, 9, 34-35, etc.). It does not give the license provided for by the "for a time continue therein" clause. On the other hand, it guards justification by faith alone by keeping the resurrection on the last day (after the Millennium) secure, regardless of the Christian's conduct. Corner, in a debate, would likely also call this doctrine a license for sin; yet, he will have trouble proving that the danger of a thousand years in hell for any grievous sin in the believer (not repented of in time), even if committed for a short period of time, provides a license for sin! God is able to encapsulate the severest consequences within the Millennial age.</p>
<p>It might be helpful for the readers to see these three views summarized:</p>
<p>1. Reformed Calvinism: The elect may commit adultery (etc.) "for a time" (at least nine months?), and yet experience happiness and glory at death, and at the Judgment Seat of Christ. If the Lord slays the elect in his sins (during this time period), he goes straight to happiness in glory. If he commits suicide, he goes straight to happiness and glory. The only thing that can cause him to doubt his eternal election is "continuing" in grievous sins for "too long" without repentance. This system of theology often sees sin as being sometimes "left" in the elect by God to work humility, etc.</p>
<p>2. Arminianism: The professing Christian will lose salvation and be eternally lost again for grievous sins. However, there are different views on what sins will bring about this loss of salvation. Some teach that only complete apostasy or blasphemy of Christ will bring eternal ruin. Others teach that committing the "not inherit" sins of Galatians 5, Ephesians 5, etc. will bring a loss of salvation. But there is not a clear line on the degree of such sins, or the length they may be committed. Many modern Arminians would be considered eternally damned by Arminians from former generations for their carnal movie-watching, immodest dress, etc. Also, there are differences of opinion concerning many times a Christian can backslide and later repent. Corner appears to believer that this cycle of repentance can go on continuously until death.</p>
<p>3. Millennial Exclusion: The believer will lose rank in the Millennial Kingdom for lesser sins. He will lose entrance into the Kingdom, altogether, for exclusion sins. His eternal salvation is secure on the Last Day, "yet so as by fire." There is no time period wherein a believer may feel free from exclusion if he is committing such sins as those mentioned in Ephesians 5, Galatians 5, etc. He does not have a "nine month pass" before he has to worry about exclusion. His salvation in eternity is by grace through faith alone. His salvation into the Millennial kingdom is by grace through faith and works.</p>
<p>Based on years of dealing with professing believers on the street, I have heard both Reformed Calvinists (and such like), as well as Arminians, exclaim or imply that if Millennial exclusion is true, they would have to change some things about their lives! Why is this so?</p>
<p>In future articles I will document that the majority of churches and large ministries in the U.S. teach that men are eternally saved through faith, confession, repenting, and bringing forth fruits. Most ministries have a four or five-step salvation plan. The majority of ministries in the U.S. also teach that no true believer will ever continue in sin for "a long time." The strange idea that modern "Christendom" is filled with those who embrace "easy believism," and teach that true believers can "continue in sin for a long time" and still be assured of eternal salvation, is a fascinating delusion. The opposite is actually the true reality. Therefore, with the majority of churches and ministries in America teaching that "true believers" will never continue in sin for a long time, why is it that there is such rampant immorality, coldness, profanity, lack of commitment, pride, double-tonguedness, etc., among so many believers? Certainly, one problem is that the view of sin has been altered. In the Bible, even making provision for sin is sin! But it is not seen to be so in this day and age.</p>
<p>Corner puts his finger on other reasons. In his book, he does a good job documenting that many who loudly and publicly decry the reality of a "carnal Christian" are only presenting a smokescreen. They still allow for continuance in weighty sins, without hell, as long as they are not indulged in for too long. Yet, Corner's Arminianism also has problems. And while he is able to expose some of the holes in the modern teaching of eternal security, and/or the perseverance of the saints, he is not able to refill them without perverting the Gospel and ending up with a Roman Catholic system of salvation by grace and works.</p>
<p>THE ARMINIANISM OF DANIEL D. CORNER REFUTED - Part 4:<br />
(BY JOEY FAUST) - CORNER'S MISTAKE ABOUT HELL</p>
<p>[The following is a refutation of, "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted," by Daniel D. Corner (http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org).]</p>
<p>In chapter 4, Corner leaves off exposing the sins of Calvin in order to expose Calvin's immediate followers in the Synod of Dort (1618-1619). He reveals how some of these men that are credited with actually formulating the Five Points of Calvinism (in answer to the Arminians) were persecutors of Arminians and Anabaptists. He argues that these persecuting Calvinists are lost, and incapable of spiritual knowledge; and that Calvin's "perseverance of the saints" must, therefore, be wrong. Yet, once again, Corner is unaware of how this argument refutes his own conditional security doctrine. Roman Catholicism has shed more blood in history than the Protestant Calvinists ever could have thought about shedding; and Rome teaches Corner's conditional security:</p>
<p>Galatians 4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 of Corner's book is quite lengthy. It is filled with almost every Bible verse that Corner could find that appears to teach a loss of eternal salvation. He lists some verses with no commentary at the start of the chapter (all from the NIV).</p>
<p>First, he lists Mark 9:43-49. This is the passage where Jesus warns John about the danger of missing the "kingdom of God" and going to "hell" during it. John is exhorted to diligently cut off every stronghold the Devil has won for sin in his life. But why is a warning about "hell" assumed to be a warning about the loss of eternal salvation? A little study of the Scriptures without the blinders of the "pop theology" inherited from the Dark Ages will go a long way in preserving us from error.</p>
<p>In the Bible, even the DEVIL comes up out of HELL at the end of the Millennial kingdom (Isaiah 14:15, Revelation 20:3); and ALL the people who miss the First Resurrection are raised up out of HELL to stand trial at the Great White Throne:</p>
<p>Revelation 20:5 But the rest of the dead LIVED NOT AGAIN UNTIL the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</p>
<p>If they lived not again "until," it therefore follows that they do live again. Even the lost are not burning in "hell" after the Millennium. They are standing before the Great White Throne:</p>
<p>Revelation 20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth<br />
12 And I saw THE DEAD, small and great, stand before God...<br />
13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and HELL DELIVERED UP THE DEAD which WERE IN them: and they were judged every man according to their works.<br />
14 And death and HELL were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br />
15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>Whosoever was not found written in the book of life is then cast into the lake of fire (not hell). The word "hell" means that which is under (as in "heel"). The New Earth (Revelation 21:1) will no longer have Hell in its center. The lost will not spend eternity in Hell. They will spend eternity in the Lake of Fire. The "lake of fire" is never called "hell." It is never "under" anything. It is before the throne of God (as seen by comparing Daniel 7:10-11 with Revelation 19:20). In Greek (since Corner rejects the AV), the word translated "hell" is often gehenna. This refers to the Valley of Hinnom. However, a deep "valley" of Hinnom, used for a trash dump (also the technical meaning of a "hell" in English), is not the same as a LAKE of fire.</p>
<p>Being cast into "hell," in Mark 9, is contrasted with entering the "kingdom of God" (Mark 9:47). This kingdom is established at the Second Coming (Mark 14:25, 15:43, Luke 21:31, Revelation 12:10, etc.). The unsaved (except for the Beast and False Prophet) are not cast into the Lake of Fire forever until AFTER the Millennial Kingdom. The "hell" of Mark 9 must be present as a place of punishment at the Second Coming, when the Kingdom is established on earth. It is, therefore (as the AV plainly reveals), the same "hell" that gives up its dead after the Millennium, when the dead "live again" at the Great White Throne.</p>
<p>John plainly possesses eternal security when he is warned by Jesus in Mark 9. He is said in the context to belong to Christ (Mark 9:41). Jesus loses none of those who have been given to Him in this sense (John 6:39). John is not warned about losing eternal salvation in Mark 9. He is warned about a temporary judgment during the Millennial age, when Hell is still present as the place of banishment. This temporary abode possesses the eternal fires of God. But the unsaved do not stay in this abode of Hell. The Devil does not even stay there forever. It therefore follows that no warning about "hell" to the Lord's saved disciples (Peter, James, John, etc.) can ever be used as a proof-text against eternal security. The unsaved come out of Hell, after the kingdom. A warning about going to "hell" and missing the coming "kingdom" is a warning about missing the Millennial Kingdom that will be established when the Lord returns. Eternal security on the Last Day (the "eighth day" after the Millennium) is not the subject or context.</p>
<p>To bring the subject of eternal security into the context of Mark 9, Corner must argue that "hell" is another word for the "Lake of fire." In reality, Hades and Gehenna are the same place (i.e. Hell), and neither refer to the Lake of Fire. Hades is revealed as possessing fire and torments (Luke 16:23-24). According to Jesus, Capernaum will be judged more severely than Sodom, and will be thrust DOWN to "hell" (Hades) in Luke 10:15. The Bible teaches that this judgment of Capernaum in Hell (Hades) will occur on the "day of judgment" (Matthew 11:23-24). This cannot be a postmillennial judgment, since Hell (Hades) gives up all of its dead after the thousand years (Revelation 20:13), and therefore, no one can be said to go to "hell" at that time.</p>
<p>In summary, Corner's use of Mark 9 to deny eternal security takes advantage of the Catholic mythology that is so rampant in even many Christian churches, today. It sees "hell" as the Devil's castle, and as the final place of eternal torment for the lost. Contrary to this teaching, the Bible reveals Hell to be a temporary abode that nevertheless, possesses God's eternal fire - the same eternal fire that came down out of heaven from God, and burned up the city of Sodom:</p>
<p>Jude 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p>The Devil will not be in Hell until the Second Coming of Christ. Hell is not his domain. He has no desire to be anywhere near Hell. After the thousand years, the Devil will be released from Hell. Then, all of the dead will live again out of Hell (they will be resurrected). Of these dead, those who are not found written in the book of life, will then be cast into the lake of fire, forever:</p>
<p>Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>Those who will be found in the book of life will have their tears wiped away (Revelation 21:4), and they will be dwell with God in happiness, forever. They have believed on the Lord and therefore promised a resurrection on the Last Day:</p>
<p>John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the LAST DAY.<br />
40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p>Contrary to Corner's doctrine, Jesus loses no one who has ever believed on Him. He may punish them. They may miss the prizes and glories of the Millennial Kingdom (in time). But they are secure on the last day when the eternal age begins.</p>
<p>Corner often makes use of the words of Jesus in Mark 9. But he misses the plain context. He is correct in noticing that the saved disciples are warned. But he is wrong in lumping the Millennial Kingdom and eternity together, with no distinctions. He makes no distinction between the premillennial judgment and the postmillennial judgment. As I have shown, he continually assumes that the kingdom always means heaven, and that heaven always means the eternal kingdom. Corner begins with this assumption and runs with 28 pages of argumentation. Yet, all he ever proves is that true believers can miss the Millennial Kingdom, and that they should labor to enter this wonderful age of blessing.</p>

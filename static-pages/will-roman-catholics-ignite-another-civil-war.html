        <h1>WILL ROMAN CATHOLICS IGNITE ANOTHER CIVIL WAR?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p align="JUSTIFY">(Pastor Joey Faust, Mansfield TX, pastor@kingdomBaptist.org; 469-658-6046)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I am fully aware of the importance of state's rights, and the dangers of an over-reaching federalism, set in motion by Abraham Lincoln. Yet, the background history concerning the War Between the States (1861-65) is more complex than many have realized. Some have called attention to the fact that Lincoln was not exactly an Abolitionist (he wanted to re-colonize the freed slaves to Africa). But there are other important issues that are missed. On one side, we have a pro-Lincoln mythology that, among other things, is blind to the groundwork that Lincoln laid for further abuses of the Constitution (resulting in the modern, federal Leviathan). However, on the other side, few have understood the Catholic plans for the Old South and the Confederacy, and the part Lincoln played in temporarily thwarting them, at the cost of his own life. This information needs to be shouted from the housetops in our age. We are getting closer to a possible civil war in America. It is reasonable to expect some Roman Catholics to fan the flames - just as they did in the first War Between the States. The following words of Abraham Lincoln serve as a warning to our age:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"The Pope and his Jesuits have advised, supported, and directed Jeff Davis on the land, from the first gun shot at Fort Sumter, by the rabid Roman Catholic Beauregard. They are helping him on the sea by guiding and supporting the other rabid Roman Catholic pirate, Semmes, on the ocean...The Mormon and the Jesuit priests are equally the uncompromising enemies of our constitution and our laws; but the more dangerous of the two is the Jesuits...[Rome] divides our nation, in order to weaken, subdue, and rule it." (Abraham Lincoln, quoted in Charles Chiniquy's, "Fifty Years in the Church of Rome," 1886)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Vatican ultimately desires gun control in America in order to accomplish its long-held goals of overthrowing the First Amendment (see the encyclical from Pope Gregory XVI, in 1832, which calls liberty of conscience an "absurd and erroneous doctrine"; and also Pius IX's encyclical Quanta Cura, December 8, 1864, which likewise condemns the First Amendment). It has taken over a century to flood America with enough Catholic immigrants (while opposing birth control) to begin to reach these stated goals.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As for the Second Amendment, Joe Biden (the first Roman Catholic vice president) has been appointed to lead the "task force on gun violence" with men like Thomas Nee (Nee's son, Joseph Nee, was convicted in 2008 for plotting to commit a Columbine-style mass murder at Marshfield High School in Massachusetts!). The Catholic Church opposes firearms for civilians:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"Gun control: Church firmly, quietly opposes firearms for civilians...Di Ruzza told Catholic News Service that the Vatican is one of just a handful of states that would like to see small arms and weapons included in the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty..." ("Catholic News Service," 2011)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "Most Catholics say yes to gun control, poll shows..." ("The Salt Lake Tribune," Dec. 18, 2012)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">However, based on the behavior of many Catholics in the period of the Civil War, it is not unreasonable to expect some of them to play both sides and actually fire the first shots, launching a new civil war. This will grant a "justification" for the federal government to begin confiscating guns and resisting so-called domestic "terrorists." The goal will be the quick eradication of what is left of any masculinity in America. For this reason, let sober minds prevail; may we open our eyes to the ways of Rome, and how it has already provoked Americans into one Civil War, with the death of possibly 850,000 soldiers. The following history will provide a foundation for keeping a watchful eye on any fanatical Catholics who may arise, claiming to be resisting tyranny.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Samuel F.B. Morse (who died in 1872) was the inventor of the telegraph and Morse Code. In 1834, he authored, "A Foreign Conspiracy against the Liberties of the United States" (a seventh edition was issued in 1854). He exposed the Catholic Church and its open hatred of American liberties and its agenda to bring an end to the freedom of speech and religion. Morse subsequently authored, "Imminent Dangers to the Free Institutions of the United States through Foreign Immigration." He died with these views. Morse worked hard to try to prevent the War Between the States. But he was not prepared for the extent of Lincoln's reaction. In 1864, Morse called Lincoln a "fanatic on the throne" for his role in turning the presidential chair into a monarchical throne:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "[Morse] continued to oppose the measures of the Administration..." (Samuel Finley Breese Morse, "Samuel F.B. Morse: His Letters and Journals," 1914)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Morse believed that "loyalty" was owed only to the Constitution (not Presidents, etc.). He felt any President who violated the Constitution was himself disloyal to the country and its people. Morse was a firm believer in states' rights.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, Morse had personally warned Lincoln about the plots of Rome to destroy the country and ultimately assassinate him. The Catholic influence in American society (before the war) was much stronger in the South than in the North. This demographic would change in the late 19th century when most of the ancestors of U.S. Catholics arrived in this country. The North certainly had some Irish immigrant laborers, but the Old South had a considerable number of influential Catholic families. Robert E. Lee had Catholics in his family, and Jefferson Davis was educated by Dominicans. Rome officially recognized the Confederacy when the Pope wrote a letter to Davis beginning with the words: "His Excellency, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America." At least twenty Confederate Generals were Roman Catholic. After the war, Jefferson Davis, President of the defeated Confederate States, was imprisoned. To comfort him, Pope Pius IX sent him a crown of thorns woven by his own hands!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Charles Chiniquy was an ex-Catholic priest and a friend of Abraham Lincoln:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">“Rev. Charles Chiniquy, who died in Montreal… was probably the most widely known preacher of recent years…In 1857, he was excommunicated. Such was his influence over his people that out of over 400 families…all but fifteen followed him out of the church and joined the Presbyterian church…In 1854, he was sued for slander…and through the skillful pleadings of ex-President Lincoln, Chiniquy was cleared.” (“Oak Park Reporter,” February 23, 1899)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In his book, "Fifty Years in the Church of Rome" (1886) he gives us some amazing insight into the role Rome played in provoking the nation to a bloody war with itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "At the end of August [1861], having known from a Roman Catholic priest, whom, by the mercy of God, I had persuaded to leave the errors of Popery, that there was a plot among them to assassinate the President, I thought it was my duty to go and tell him what I knew, at the same time giving him a new assurance of gratitude for what he had done for me...'I am so glad to meet you again,' [Lincoln] said: 'you see that your friends, the Jesuits, have not yet killed me...I am sorry to have so little time to see you: but I will not let you go before telling you that, a few days ago, I saw Mr. Morse, the learned inventor of electric telegraphy: he told me that when he was in Rome, not long ago, he found out the proofs of a most formidable conspiracy against this country and all its institutions. It is evident that it is to the intrigues and emissaries of the Pope that we owe, in great part, the horrible evil war which is threatening to cover the country with blood and ruins...I do not know any man in the United States so well acquainted as you are with the tricks of the Jesuits, and on the devotedness of whom I could better rely...'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> Chiniquy warned the president:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "The unanimity with which the Catholic hierarchy of the United States is on the side of the rebels is an incontrovertible evidence that Rome wants to destroy this republic, and as you are, by your personal virtues, your popularity, your love for liberty, your position, the greatest obstacle to the diabolical schemes, their hatred is concentrated upon you...My blood chills in my veins when I contemplate the day which may come, sooner or later, when Rome will add to all her other iniquities the murder of Abraham Lincoln..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> Lincoln responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "Unfortunately, I feel more and more, every day, that it is not against the Americans of the South, alone, I am fighting, it is more against the Pope of Rome...it is my impression that the Jesuits, who are the principal rulers of the South, will do what they have almost invariably done in the past. The dagger, or the pistol of one of their adepts, will do what the strong hands of the warriors could not achieve. This civil war seems to be nothing but a political affair to those who do not see, as I do, the secret springs of that terrible drama. But it is more a religious than a civil war. It is Rome who wants to rule and degrade the North, as she has ruled and degraded the South, from the very day of its discovery. There are only very few of the Southern leaders who are not more or less under the influence of the Jesuits, through their wives, family relations, and their friends. Several members of the family of Jeff Davis belong to the Church of Rome. Even the Protestant ministers are under the influence of the Jesuits without suspecting it. To keep her ascendancy in the North, as she does in the South, Rome is doing here what she has done in Mexico, and in all the South American Republics; she is paralyzing, by a civil war, the arms of the soldiers of Liberty. SHE DIVIDES OUR NATION, IN ORDER TO WEAKEN, SUBDUE AND RULE IT..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> The last time Chiniquy had a visit with Lincoln was June 8, 1864:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "After a kind and warm shaking of hands, he said: 'I am much pleased to see you again. But it is impossible, today...But do not leave Washington before I see you again; I have some important matters on which I want to know your mind'...The next day, it was my privilege to have the greatest honour ever received by me. The good President wanted me to stand at his right hand, when he received the delegation...The next day, he kindly took me with him in his carriage...The only thought which seemed to occupy the mind of the President was the part which Rome had in that horrible struggle. Many times he repeated: 'This war would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits. We owe it to Popery that we now see our land reddened with the blood of her noblest sons. Though there were great differences of opinion between the South and the North, on the question of slavery, neither Jeff Davis nor any one of the leading men of the Confederacy would have dared to attack the North, had they not relied on the promises of the Jesuits, that under the mask of Democracy, the money and the arms of the Roman Catholic, even the arms of France, were at their disposal, if they would attack us. I pity the priests, the bishops and the monks of Rome in the United States, when the people realize that they are, in great part, responsible for the tears and the blood shed in this war...I conceal what I know, on that subject, from the knowledge of the nation; for if the people knew the whole truth, this war would turn into a religious war, and it would, at once, take a tenfold more savage and bloody character...It would become a war of extermination on both sides. The Protestants of both the North and the South would surely unite to exterminate the priests and the Jesuits, if they could hear what Professor Morse has said to me of the plots made in the very city of Rome to destroy this Republic, and if they could learn how the priests, the nuns, and the monks, which daily land on our shores, under the pretext of preaching their religion...to undermine our institutions, alienate the hearts of our people from our Constitution...and prepare a reign of anarchy here as they have done in Ireland, in Mexico, in Spain, and wherever there are any people who want to be free...Have you read the letter of the Pope to Jeff Davis, and what do you think of it?...You confirm me in the views I had taken of the letter of the Pope. Professor Morse is of the same mind with you...You are perfectly correct when you say that it was to detach the Roman Catholics who had enrolled themselves in our armies. Since the publication of that letter, a great number of them have deserted their banners and turned traitors...Meade has remained with us, and gained the bloody battle of Gettysburg...But it is evident that his Romanism superseded his patriotism after the battle. He let the army of Lee escape...From the beginning of our civil war, there has been, not a secret, but a public alliance, between the Pope of Rome and Jeff Davis...The Pope and his Jesuits have advised, supported, and directed Jeff Davis on the land, from the first gun shot at Fort Sumter, by the rabid Roman Catholic Beauregard. They are helping him on the sea by guiding and supporting the other rabid Roman Catholic pirate, Semmes, on the ocean...the Pope has thrown away the mask, and shown himself the public partisan and the protector of the rebellion, by taking Jeff Davis by the hand, and impudently recognizing the Southern States as a legitimate government...My ambassadors in Italy, France, and England, as well as Professor Morse, have many times warned me against the plots of the murderers which they have detected in those different countries...'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Chiniquy claims that John Wilkes Booth converted to Catholicism before he murdered Lincoln. Several books close to the assassination document the fact that the chief conspirators were Catholic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"I mention it as an exceptional and remarkable fact, that every conspirator in custody is by education a Catholic." ("Burlington Daily Hawk Eye," May 10, 1865)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "Fathers Wiget and Walter administered the dying service of the Catholic Church to Mrs. Surratt [one of the conspirators], holding the cross to her lips..." (John Edward Buckingham, “Reminiscences and Souvenirs of the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln,” 1894)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> "The Surratts were Catholics, Dr. Mudd was a Catholic, O'Laughlin was a Catholic, and the report gained wide currency that all those apprehended were of the Roman communion and that the Church of Rome had planned the slaughter of the President." (Clara Elizabeth Laughlin, "The Death of Lincoln," 1909)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> In conclusion, may we repent for the murder of the unborn in our land, and the many other sins that are committed and tolerated. May we learn the forgotten truth that we can love Catholics as people, benevolently, while hating their unbiblical delusions. May we warn those who should know better not to be led into the snare of Rome simply to increase their own platform. The Book of Revelation, chapter 17, clearly reveals that Rome (the city on seven mountains) will rise again and will be drunk with the blood of the martyrs, as she spreads her fornication (spiritual and literal) around the world. The Beast will use the Roman Catholic Church (and her feminism) to come to full power.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Note:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There has been an attempt by Roman Catholics (and others who just can’t bring themselves to believe that Lincoln could speak against the Pope) to denounce Chiniquy as a liar. Other historians, however, have used his book for information concerning Lincoln – while shying away from the controversy. Perhaps those who doubt that Lincoln could have made these statements should review the following statements from other American leaders:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> “…they may as well establish Popery in New York and the other colonies as they did in Canada. They had no right to do it there than here. Your lives, your property, your religion, are all at stake.” (Alexander Hamilton, “Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress”)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> “I do not like the reappearance of the Jesuits. Shall we not have regular swarms of them here, in as many disguises as only a king of the Gypsies can assume, dressed as printers, publishers, writers and schoolmasters? If ever there was a body of men who merited damnation on earth and in Hell, it is this society of Loyola’s. Nevertheless, we are compelled by our system of religious toleration to offer them an asylum.” (John Adams, Letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 5, 1816)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> “Do you think a Protestant Popedom is annihilated in America? Do you recollect, or have you ever attended to the ecclesiastical strifes in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and every part of New England? What a mercy it is that these People cannot whip and crop, and pillory and roast, AS YET in the U.S.! If they could they would.” (John Adams, Letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 18, 1817)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> “Do you know that The General of the Jesuits and consequently all his Hosts have their Eyes on this Country?” (John Adams, Letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 1817)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> “Can a free government possibly exist with the Roman Catholic religion?” (John Adams, Letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 19, 1821)</p>

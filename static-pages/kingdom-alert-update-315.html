KING JAMES BIBLE READINGS IN THE EPISTLE OF POLYCARP:

The Bible teaches us that we are not ignorant of his devices (2 Cor. 2:11). In other words, if we will search the Scriptures, we will be prepared to resist the Devil's crafty traps. For example, Satan's first words to Eve reveal the whole foundation of his modus operandi:

Genesis 3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

We see that Satan comes to cast doubt on Scripture: "Hath God said?  Is the Bible really preserved? Maybe we will find older manuscripts that will show that we have been wrong about the Bible." He has many ways of tempting people to doubt God's words.

Next, we see that Satan (whose first word to Eve was a positive-thinking "yea") comes to deny God's judgment upon sin. He will try to tempt unbelievers into believing that they will never experience eternal torment in a literal lake of fire. And he will try to tempt Christians into believing that there is no accountability for sin in the Christian walk. They can never be punished in this life, or at the Judgment Seat of Christ. They do not have to, "press toward the mark for the prize," so they can, "if by any means...attain unto the resurrection of the dead" (Phil. 3). He comes to directly contradict every warning that the Lord gives to His people and show how it means the opposite.

It is interesting that when we examine the ancient Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, we find these two lies of Satan rebuked. Polycarp uses King James Bible readings instead of the readings found in newer versions (NIV, NAS). Yet, the argument for supposedly "correcting" the KJV was that "older manuscripts" had been discovered since the time of the King James translators. For example, Tischendorf discovered Sinaiticus in a waste basket of a monastery (1844). The manuscript is dated at the middle of the 4th century. The Vaticanus manuscript was released to scholars in the 19th century (by Rome) to help further the restless movement among some scholars for "revising" the King James Bible. It is also dated in the 4th century. Before long, many Christians realized that the Bible was not being "revised" at all; an entirely different text was being substituted for the old on the basis of "new light" and "progress" in textual criticism.

Yet, if these differences in the new versions are supposedly closer to the "originals," why is it when we read the Epistle of Polycarp we find King James Bible readings in contrast to the readings of new versions?:

"...there is nothing improbable in the conjecture of Usher, that [Polycarp] was the 'angel of the church in Smyrna'...His pupil Irenaeus [describes him], '...how he would speak of conversations he had held with John and with others who had seen the Lord...'...The authenticity [of this Epistle of Polycarp] can on no fair grounds be questioned. It is abundantly established by external testimony...We shall not...be far wrong if we [date it] about the middle of the SECOND century."
(Roberts, Donaldson, Coxe, "Ante-Nicene Fathers," 1908)

This Epistle of Polycarp, while not inspired, certainly contains more validity than these later "bible
 manuscripts of heretics, centuries later. Let us examine these early Scripture readings of Polycarp and see which version of the Bible they resemble. Even though Polycarp often mixes Scriptures, and quotes freely, we are able, nevertheless, to discern the KJV readings as opposed to the NAS, NIV, etc.:

"by grace ye are saved, not of works."
(Polycarp)

Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
(KJV)

"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
(NAS)

======================

"But the love of money is the root of all evils."
(Polycarp)

1 Timothy 6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil...
(KJV)

"For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil..."
(NAS)

=======================

"we must all appear at the judgment-seat of Christ, and must every one give an account of himself."
(Polycarp)

Romans 14:10...for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
(KJV)

"...For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God...So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God."
(NAS)

=======================

 "For whosoever does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is antichrist..."
(Polycarp)

1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
 (KJV)

"and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist.."
(NAS)

======================

"Watching unto prayer."
(Polycarp)

1 Peter 4:7...and watch unto prayer.
(KJV)

"...sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
(NAS)

======================

"who bore our sins in His own body on the tree..."
(Polycarp)

1 Peter 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree...
(KJV)

"...He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross..."
(NAS)

======================

 The Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians is one more testimony that God has indeed preserved His words, as He has promised. It is a rebuke to Satan's, "Yea, hath God said...?"

But Satan has not finished. New Testament saints are reminded repeatedly to not be deceived concerning accountability for sin (after salvation) in relation to the coming kingdom (1 Cor. 6:9, Gal. 6:7, Eph. 5:6). It is obvious that there is a grave danger that many Christians will allow men with vain words to deceive them about this subject. Polycarp (no later than 150 A.D., or earlier, and possibly even a disciple of John, as history claims) reveals that early Christians firmly believed there would be serious accountability for God's people when the Lord returns.

There are only two possible views concerning the doctrine of these early, extra-biblical writings. Men such as Polycarp believed in a total loss of salvation (Arminianism), or he believed in kingdom exclusion (Millennial), and punishment at the Judgment Seat, but not a loss of eternal salvation.

The fact that he stresses eternal salvation by grace, not of works, reveals that he used the phrase "the kingdom" to be the Millennium (like Irenaeus, his disciple).

Those who deny possible punishment for Christians at the Judgment Seat must not only ignore scores of verses in the inspired Scriptures, they must maintain that the earliest historical Christians (all of them) were immediately deceived on such an important issue as eternal salvation. Yet, we find the earliest historical Christians (such as Clement to the Corinthians, and Polycarp) not only affirming salvation by grace, not of works, but also teaching that the coming kingdom is obtained by overcoming sin in the walk:

ACCOUNTABILITY TEACHING IN THE EPISTLE OF POLYCARP:

"..to our Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death...knowing that by grace ye are saved, not of works...Wherefore, girding up your loins, serve the Lord in fear...But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise us up also, if we do His will, and walk in His commandments and love what He loved, keeping ourselves from all unrighteousness, covetousness, love of money, evil speaking, falsewitness, 'not rendering evil for evil...Knowing then that God is not mocked, we ought to walk worthy of His commandment and glory...If we please Him in the present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, we shall also reign together with Him...In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things...For it is well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the world, since every lust warreth against the spirit, and neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God, nor those who do things inconsistent and unbecoming...for we are before the eyes of our Lord and God, and we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, and must every one give an account of himself. Let us then serve Him in fear, and with all reverence...whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and says that there is neither resurrection or judgment, he is the firstborn of Satan. Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many, and their false doctrines, let us return to the word...But woe to him by whom the name of the Lord is blasphemed! Teach, therefore, sobriety to all, and manifest it also in your own conduct...I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you...If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. But who of us are ignorant of the judgment of the Lord?...I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him [Valens] and his wife; to whom may the Lord grant true repentance!...do not count such as enemies, but call them back as suffering an straying members..."

Observations:

In this letter of Polycarp we plainly see the balance that Kingdom exclusion, and temporary punishment at the Judgment Seat of Christ, and during the Millennial Kingdom, provides. Polycarp affirms salvation by grace, not of works. He does not believe that Valens is no longer a true believer. Yet, he maintains that he will be judged as a heathen. However, his context is the Judgment Seat of Christ and the coming kingdom. Scripture affirms the same:

 

Luke 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

Matthew 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

Those saints justly excluded from the local church, will be deemed excluded by God, in relation to the Millennial Kingdom, when Jesus returns:

Ephesians 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

In the earliest ages, directly after the Apostles,  only false teachers denied the fear of God and judgment to come for saint or sinner. They were called Marcionites and Gnostics. Tertullian argues against them, and asks them why then, they do not spend time amusing themselves in the circus, or theater, if we do not have to fear God.  

Things have certainly changed in this day and age. It is almost as if we are now living in the final days when they will not endure sound doctrine; and when they will feed themselves without fear; and when many will be deceived, crying "liberty" and "peace and safety." This is indeed the day in which we are living.

The writings of these early, so-called fathers grow increasingly erroneous, as the centuries progress. However, there is often a presumptuous dismissal of many of the earliest writers, due to the fact that these men reprove the modern theological systems. These early writers resemble "fundamentalists" much more than they resemble the "win friends and influence people" brand of modern Christianity, so-called. They teach separation, modesty, holiness, and carefulness. Seventh Day Adventists must dismiss their writings since they teach that the Lord's Day is the 1st day of the week. Postmillennialists, etc., must dismiss them, since these earliest "fathers" are clearly Premillennial literalists.

In reviewing these early writers (ante-Nicene), I am increasingly finding that, though they are not without some blemish, they are nevertheless in general conformity with the Bible. The problem is that today, much of modern fundamentalism is worldly and drenched in psychology (i.e. self, no responsibility, etc.). Without the fear of God plainly taught, worldliness has set in. Therefore, not only the Bible, but these early, post-Apostolic writings sound very foreign to delicate ears that cannot endure sound doctrine and warning.

May the Lord help us. May some real men wake up, and face what we have done. Unless we restore the fear of God, and resist Satan's lies, we labor, largely, in vain.

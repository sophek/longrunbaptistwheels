CRISCO AND MARGARINE: THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT CHANGES ITS MIND, YET SHOWS NO REMORSE FOR MISLEADING MILLIONS INTO HEART DISEASE AND DEATH
**********************************************************************

In the 20th century, hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated vegetable oil (safflower, soybean, etc.) began to be used and praised in America. The public was warned by the medical community and the government to avoid time-tested foods like real butter (Genesis 18:8, 2 Samuel 17:29, Job 29:6, Isaiah 7:15, etc.), etc. "Butter is dangerous for your heart," we were told. Certainly, pesticides, and cows raised in pens, instead of being grass-fed, limited the nutritional qualities of much that was sold as butter. But at least people were eating a real food. We might also add that there are much healthier things in the universe than pork lard! But at least it was "food." But then came the scare!

Millions switched to (supposedly) "heart healthy" hydrogenated oils (e.g. margarine, Crisco, etc.). These were imitation foods. Suddenly, almost every packaged product on the shelves contained hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Almost every restaurant used them, and even boasted in them: "We use heart-friendly vegetable oil." Americans could indulge in fried foods without having to worry about unhealthy pig lard. They could now enjoy fried foods at the local diner (fried potatoes, fried sandwiches, fried everything). It was all fried in 100% vegetable oil (partially hydrogenated oil).

The process of hydrogenation was used in 1907 for soaps and candles! But why not use the new, easy-to-make product for food? Crisco was first sold to the public for food consumption in 1911. It was later marketed to "sophisticated women" as the "new thing." It was the dawning of the chemical, imitation age. And many women were ready to cut off their hair, as well as try the new, imitation, cheap foods. There were no more odors. It was easy to use. And hardly anyone (at least at first) questioned whether the partially hydrogenated oils in Crisco (the trans fats) were healthy. To these women, Crisco made as much sense as the newly invented appliances.

This new product made many "food" companies very happy. They could now fill their products with hydrogenated oils and thereby prolong the shelf-life of their processed foods (i.e. bugs will eat real food, but they do not like to eat plastic!). Housewives were told that these new "fats" were "easy to digest" by the children. Mothers were made to feel that they were not being "thoughtful" unless they jumped on the new bandwagon. Notice a newspaper article in 1922. Watch for the propaganda. I have placed important words in capital letters:

"The fats they need - now easy to digest - what this digestible shortening means to THOUGHTFUL mothers: That 'hollow-legged' son of yours! That gentle, shy little daughter! What a glad RESPONSIBILITY is their rearing! We know, for example, that buoyant health, in middle life often depends on childhood food - on mother's LOVING supervision of the kitchen. DR. ROBERT HUTCHISON (the English AUTHORITY) says that your 14 year old boy needs practically as much food as a grown-up man. But he stresses the need for SPECIAL DIGESTIBILITY in the child's foods...Many OFFICIAL investigators interested primarily in the health of our American children have made this discovery...So, nowadays, WELL-INFORMED mothers appreciate the importance of DIGESTIBILITY in family foods...In homes where the mother herself keeps a WATCHFUL eye on the family health you will find that CRISCO is displacing less digestible fats. These mothers prefer - because of its digestibility - this vegetable shortening, Crisco. Crisp, easily digested fried foods! Wholesome, delicious cakes, pies and cookies. What a real comfort to bake and to fry with Crisco - free from ANXIOUS DOUBTS about the digestibility of the foods you serve...UP-TO-DATE grocers everywhere take real pleasure in selling this HEALTHFUL food ingredient - Crisco."
("The Oakland Tribune," Aug. 6, 1922)

Proctor &amp; Gamble offered a free cookbook that replaced traditional fats with the new Crisco. They used pictures of smiling, happy children, with an open Crisco-tub in the foreground. This is how it all began: Mothers who use Crisco will keep their house smelling fresh; there will be no smoke; it costs less, since you use less; and, most of all, the children will be healthier!:

"[In] New York City...the Bureau of Child Hygiene estimated that 216,000 school children, prosperous and poor alike, were seriously under-nourished."
("The Oakland Tribune," May 15, 1922)

And what was the suggested answer for this problem? Switch to Crisco! (And why not "bob" your hair while you are at it? After all, "everyone is doing it!"). It was marketed to sophisticated mothers (i.e. the new generation) as the "prized kitchen companion" (sounds like a devil!). It "stays sweet and fresh," ("Modesto News-Herald," January 9, 1926). Indeed, this was another main reason why so many women switched; you could reuse it more than just two or three times (like liquid plastic!).

The worst part of all of this was that the medical establishment (the people who pride themselves on saving the "common people" from quackery and scams) led the way into the jaws of death and disease:

"No one among you - though the picture of health now - can really afford to cook without Crisco. Crisco is HEALTH-VALUE...Crisco itself digests quickly - doesn't overtax your stomach!...Why Crisco is quick-digesting - recommended by MANY DOCTORS - When you open a can of Crisco it's like looking at glossy, molded cream. By a MODERN MIRACLE, pure, wholesome vegetable oils are creamed into the lightest, creamiest shortening you can imagine...It stays sweet and fresh without refrigeration!...{IT] SAVES THE FOOD FROM BECOMING FATTENING. Â DOCTORS KNOW THIS - that's why they often ADVISE frying foods with Crisco!..."
("The Mansfield News Journal," March 22, 1935)

Few thought to ask why it does not stay in the stomach for digesting; the answer is probably that none of the millions of critters in the stomach want anything to do with it! Few thought to ask why it stays fresh without refrigeration! It wasn't really food! (The bugs were smarter than modern humans).

It was not long before there was an epidemic of heart disease in America, as never before. And what did the medical establishment suggest? Did they examine Crisco and margarine? No. They silenced the people who tried to warn the public. And instead of confessing their errors, they suggested that the best way to avoid this new epidemic of heart disease was to, "Eat more partially-hydrogenated vegetable oils and margarine!" Notice the "professional" advice in 1972:

"Most shortenings, cooking and salad oils on the market are lightly hydrogenated because, of the desirability (from the viewpoint of 'HEART HEALTH') to replace a good amount of the saturated fats of the diet with polyunsaturated fats."
("In Defense of the Nitrates"; Long Beach "Independent," November, 30, 1972)

After millions had died or become ill for many decades, and the information could no longer be suppressed, and lawsuits were soon to arise, many experts began to give new advice:

"Admonished for decades to cut back on saturated fats to lower their cholesterol, millions of Americans made sensible dietary changes that they thought would protect their hearts. They switched from butter to margarine, looked for 'made with pure vegetable shortening' on packages of baked and fried products, sought fast foods that were not fried in beef fat and many even gave up eating meat....But now they are hearing disturbing news that margarine may not be so good for the heart after all, that vegetable shortening is even less advantageous than margarine, that at least some of the saturated fat in red meat does not raise cholesterol...It is enough to make a health-conscious person wonder whether to return to the eggs-butter-cream-and-steak diet...In a report this month from the continuing Nurses' Health Study at the Harvard School of Public Health, frequent consumption of margarine and vegetable shortening was linked to a 50 percent higher rate of coronary deaths..." ("The Mountain Democrat," May 10, 1993)

"Trans Fatty Acids and Coronary Heart Disease - By the early 1990s it became apparent that the consumption of trans fatty acids (hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils) had uniquely adverse effects on blood lipid levels in metabolic studies and was associated with an INCREASED RISK OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE...Many fast foods contain high levels of trans fatty acids, are exempt from labeling regulations, and can even be advertised as cholesterol-free and cooked in vegetable oil."
("The New England Journal of Medicine," June 24, 1999 Vol. 340, No. 25)

"In short, trans fats are poisons, just like arsenic or cyanide. They interfere with the metabolic processes of life by taking the place of a natural substance that performs a critical function. And that is the definition of a poison. Your body has no defense against them...Walking down supermarket aisles in America, you find product after product with partially hydrogenated oil - often in products you would never expect. But why not? After all, it's cheaper than butter. And it's not illegal. Yet. When you eat out, restaurant breads and fried foods are loaded with stuff. As a result, Americans are consuming soybean oil -partially hydrogenated soybean oil - in virtually everything they eat. It's no wonder that America is experiencing epidemic levels of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer...Now, deep frying all by itself is pretty bad. After all, you are applying a lot of heat. But if that heat is applied to a saturated fat, there is a limit to how much harm it can do...For commercial deep frying, though, butter is prohibitively expensive. Things were better when foods were fried in beef tallow and coconut oil, because they had a lot of flavor and the saturated fats aren't harmed by the heat. But all that saturated fat sounds bad, so restaurants switched to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils...the absolute worst commercial frying is done by the fast-food chains, who almost uniformly do their deep frying in cheap, deadly partially hydrogenated oil."
(<a href="http://www.treelight.com/health/nutrition/PartiallyHydrogenatedOils.html" target="_blank">http://www.treelight.com/health/nutrition/PartiallyHydrogenatedOils.html</a>)

In light of this new research, notice how supermarket chains have changed their tune! For example, Kroger now recommends that you beware of many of the products in its store that have hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils:

"Margarine was developed in the late 1800s as an inexpensive alternative to butter. Typically margarine is made from one or more partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (soy, corn, sunflower, or safflower), but it may also contain animal fats. Packaged baked goods, crackers and chips. Most processed foods contain partially hydrogenated soybean, coconut, or palm oil. Vegetable shortening...Among the most important dietary changes in protecting arteries from atherosclerosis is avoiding foods that contain trans fatty acids (margarine, some vegetable oil and many processed foods containing vegetable oil). Increasingly, the importance of avoiding trans fatty acids is being accepted by the scientific community. Leading researchers have recently begun to view the evidence linking trans fatty acids to markers for heart disease as 'unequivocal.'...Margarine consumption is linked to increased risk of unfavorable changes in cholesterol levels and heart disease. Therefore, margarine and other processed foods containing partially hydrogenated oil should be avoided."
(<a href="http://www.kroger.com/hn/Food_Guide/Trans_Fats.htm" target="_blank">http://www.kroger.com/hn/Food_Guide/Trans_Fats.htm</a>)

This is amazing advice! But it is not quite as amazing as the new advice given by the American Heart Association:

"Effective Jan. 1, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires food companies to list trans fat content separately on the Nutrition Facts panel of all packaged foods...This labeling requirement applies only to packaged food products, NOT FOODS SERVED AT RESTAURANTS. However, it is important to note that the FDA is extending the trans fat deadline for those companies who seek a petition. Therefore, consumers should be aware that just because they do not see trans fat on the label of the product, does not mean that the product is trans free...Trans fat (also called trans fatty acids) is formed when liquid vegetable oils go through a chemical process called hydrogenation, in which hydrogen is added to make the oils more solid. Hydrogenated vegetable fats are used by food processors because they allow longer shelf-life and give food desirable taste, shape, and texture...The majority of trans fat can be found in shortenings, stick (or hard) margarine, cookies, crackers, snack foods, fried foods (including fried fast food), doughnuts, pastries, baked goods, and other processed foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS that consumption of trans fat raises LDL ('bad') cholesterol levels and lowers HDL ('good') cholesterol levels, CAUSING THE ARTERIES TO BECOME CLOGGED and increasing the risk of developing heart disease and stroke."
(<a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4776" target="_blank">http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4776</a>)

And there you have it! Quietly, with no apology, they simply tell you, "By the way, make sure that you don't take the advice that we professionals have been bombarding you with for many decades. It will kill you!"

Meanwhile, even many hospitals feed their sick patients this "life-giving," "healthy, creamy margarine! (After all, it keeps the customers coming back, doesn't it?):

"Trans fatty acids, also known as trans fat, is an artery-clogging fat that is formed when vegetable oils are hardened into margarine or shortening. It is found in many other foods besides margarine and shortening, however, including fried foods like french fries and fried chicken, doughnuts, cookies, pastries and crackers. In the United States, typical french fries have about 40 percent trans fatty acids and many popular cookies and crackers range from 30 percent to 50 percent trans fatty acids. Doughnuts have about 35 percent to 40 percent trans fatty acids...Trans fat is known to increase blood levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL), or 'bad' cholesterol, while lowering levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), known as 'good' cholesterol. It can also cause major clogging of arteries, type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, and was found to increase the risk of heart disease. Many food companies use trans fat instead of oil because it reduces cost, extends storage life of products and can improve flavor and texture..."
(Dr. Joseph Mercola, "Trans-Fat: What Exactly is it, and Why is it so Dangerous?")

"Investigators reviewed medical and dietary data from more than 84,000 women who did not have diabetes, heart disease or cancer when the study began in 1980. Results show that intake of total fat, saturated fat and monounsaturated fat found in nuts, seeds and avocados did not influence diabetes risk. But a 2% increase in calories from trans fatty acids RAISED THE RISK BY 39%...(American Journal of Clinical Nutrition June 2001;73:1001-1002, 1019-1026)...Believe me, folks, you do not want to mess around with trans fats. They are one of the worst things that you could be eating, no matter how good they taste."
(Mercola, "Trans Fats, NOT Saturated Fats, Increase Diabetes Risk")

"Both primate and human studies have shown inappropriate handling of blood sugar; trans fatty acids decrease the response of the red blood cell to insulin, thus having a potentially undesirable effect in diabetics. The primate research was initiated at Maryland in collaboration with the U. S. Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health, and the human research is from the University of Pittsburgh and quite recent...Recent research from outside the U. S. has indicated that trans fatty acids interfere with reproductive attributes and of concern is the finding that trans fatty acids lower the amount of cream (volume) in milk from lactating females in all species studies including humans, thus lowering the overall quality available to the infant. The latter research was done at Maryland by my colleague Dr. Beverly Teter...Dr. Ancel Keys had originally claimed that the partially hydrogenated vegetable oils with their trans fatty acids were the CULPRITS IN HEART DISEASE. This was in 1958, and the edible oils industry was very swift in their squelching of that information; they shifted the emphasis to 'saturated' fat and started the phony attack on meat and dairy fats."
(Dr. Mary Enig Interviewed By Richard A. Passwater, Ph.D.; Mercola)

What is the moral of all of this? The moral is that we should always trust our Bible - even when it speaks about physical health and food! If the Bible says an egg is good (Luke 11:12-13), then it is good, regardless of what the medical community thinks about it! If Jesus ate butter as a child, and the Bible speaks of it as a good thing (Isaiah 7:15), then it is certainly good for us. We should, of course, make sure that these foods come from healthy animals that have not been abused, poisoned or fed chemicals, blood or trash. But the foods themselves are good, regardless of what the doctors or scientists teach.

There are many Christians that will laugh at scientists who teach that we come from monkeys. But any scientist who teaches that Bible foods are in themselves bad for us should be rejected in the same manner. At the same time, we must beware of marketing hype, and be sure to read labels and understand them (yet we must know that sometimes these food companies have been given freedom to lie on their labels).

The Bible is true on every subject upon which it speaks, whether it is geography, science, astronomy, history, nutrition, health or salvation! And when "science" disagrees with the Bible, you can be sure that you are dealing with "science falsely so called" (1 Timothy 6:20). It should be immediately rejected. The so-called wisdom has probably been purchased in order to make more money to the hurt of millions of people (1 Timothy 6:10).

I am not at all preaching down to the generation of my fathers who were raised on Crisco, margarine, high-fructose-corn-syrup (things outlawed in many other countries of the world), white sugar and white flour, etc. I also grew up on most of these things. It saddens me to think of those who have already passed away, as well as my dear brethren who are already sick, or who are getting sick. My point is that it may not be too late to change, and have some productive years added to our lives. And we should learn that we cannot trust the medical establishment and the "authorities." Anyone who says that we can trust them needs to explain why the people of America were indoctrinated for 80 years with advice to give up their wholesome foods and replace them with imitation foods that these same professionals now tell us will give you diabetes and heart disease! Where is the apology? Where is the national outcry? Men have become too passive. Our forefathers at the start of the 20th century were led to believe that professionals would do the thinking for them in many areas. They left the thinking to women, and abandoned their leadership roles. And the women were puffed up with pride by the marketers who crept into houses with their soap operas and advertisements. They made the women feel that it was all up to them - and that to save their homes, they MUST listen to the professionals. Therefore, Granny's butter was thrown out, and Crisco replaced it. The Bible was thrown out, and Dr. Spock's psycho-babble replaced it (i.e. "spanking only creates rebels"). Finally, once the women were led to abandon their homes, the family's nutritional health was left in the hands of fast-food restaurants and pre-packaged, card-board products, filled with hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils, chemicals, dyes, refined sugar or fructose, etc.

But maybe it was all a great conspiracy to keep from having to pay out so much social security to the baby-boomer generation.

THE ARMINIANISM OF DANIEL D. CORNER REFUTED - Part 5:
(BY JOEY FAUST) Â  - ETERNAL LIFE IN THE MILLENNIUM
***********************************************************************
[The following is a refutation of, "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted," by Daniel D. Corner.]

In the last part of this series I answered the proof-texts that Corner lists at the start of his 5th chapter. In summary, although Corner is apparently a premillennialist, he nevertheless interprets most of the Bible in an amillennial or anti-millennialist fashion. He makes no distinction between Hell and the Lake of Fire; and he always interprets the kingdom as the eternal kingdom or Heaven (instead of the Millennium, as it is found in many passages). As we walk through the rest of his 5th chapter, these errors will continue to be found.

The first sentence of the 5th chapter (p. 75) is noteworthy. It reads:

"In this chapter initial salvation refers to the moment in time when a person extends a trusting-submitting faith in Jesus Christ for his personal salvation and thereby instantly receives the gift of salvation...As a recipient of eternal life he has also been declared righteous in God's sight and made a son of God..."

Corner does not use the phrase "initial salvation" to distinguish it from reward in the Millennium or at the Judgment Seat of Christ. These words are used by Corner to reveal that salvation will not be secured until what he calls "final salvation" is obtained by enduring until the end in holiness:

"Final salvation simply refers to entering the kingdom of God, which only occurs for those who die physically in a righteous state or are in such a spiritual state when the Lord returns." (Corner, p. 75)

Notice, also, how Corner uses other phrases such as "declared righteous," "spiritual state," etc. He does not use these phrases to describe imputed righteousness (i.e. the absolute righteousness of Jesus Christ credited to the account of saved sinners, who are still less than perfect in many areas, practically or experientially). In what way, then, can a new believer be "declared righteous in God's sight," at the "moment" believes, as Corner maintains? As with the word "kingdom," Corner uses such words in a reckless manner, without defining them, and not realizing that he is contradicting himself. For example, is a new believer absolutely perfect the "moment" he believes? What type of righteousness does he possess? If God declares him to be righteous, does this mean that he immediately arrives at sinless perfection the moment he first believes? If not, then Corner must believe that a believer can be "declared righteous" in spite of his imperfections and sin. If so, then Corner must confess that there is a distinction between positional, imputed righteousness (our state), and practical, infused righteousness (our walk). Yet, a few sentences later he tells us that the believer must endure in a "righteous state" to be finally saved.

The only way to resolve these contradictions is for Corner to teach that a sinner, to be "initially saved," must immediately reach a practical, righteous state by turning from sin and doing good works. This is, indeed, the common theology that is presented in most modern churches, regardless of denomination. Charles Potter, the infamous Humanist, boasted and mocked in 1930 that only a few Fundamentalist churches still taught salvation by grace through the Blood, and not by works. He predicted a fast approaching day when all churches would be Humanist churches in order to have any one attend.

But if Corner teaches that sinners are saved by turning from sin and being immediately good, why then does he use words such as "gift of salvation," "because of his faith," etc.? Certainly, a great change in conduct often occurs (and it should occur) at the moment of faith. Yet, the Bible speaks of men like Joseph of Arimathea who was a "disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews" (John 19:38). It speaks of many of the chief rulers who "believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him..." (John 12:42). It speaks of Corinthians who were "sanctified" (1 Cor. 1:2); yet, nevertheless, they walked in divisions (1:10), envy and strife (3:3), carnal, and even "as men." Â They were "full," "rich," "reigning as kings" (4:8). They were "puffed up" (4:18, 5:2). They had fornication among them, and were boasting in their acceptance and worldly "love" of such open, unrepentant sinners (5:6). They were suing each other at law (6:6-7). They were doing wrong and defrauding their brethren (6:8). Obviously, then, there must be a distinction between positional sanctification and practical sanctification. The Corinthians Paul addressed had positional sanctification; they had the imputed righteousness of Christ. But they had practical sanctification only in certain areas, and in varying degrees. And some did not have it at all!

In summary, Corner uses words and phrases as if he believes in imputed righteousness. However, he quickly reveals that he has no understanding of this great, Pauline doctrine. Instead, he advocates Augustine's eternal salvation by the infused righteousness of Christ (i.e. the practical fulfilling of the law). I do not deny that the moral law should be fulfilled daily in the lives of believers. And believers who fail to yield to the Holy Ghost do so to their own hurt. However, it is important to keep eternal salvation distinct from salvation at the Judgment Seat (reward). Eternal salvation is through faith in the Blood of Jesus, granting us the imputed righteousness of Christ (justification). Millennial reward is obtained through the infused righteousness of Christ, as we field in faith and patience:

Hebrews 6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and PATIENCE inherit the promises.

Corner continues to view the kingdom warnings as eternal salvation warnings. In regard to Luke 13:24, he writes:

"The Greek reveals a continuous tense effort to enter the kingdom is to be exerted!" (p. 77).
Again, he has assumed that entering the kingdom always means entering into eternal salvation. He argues:

"The Christian is consequently warned of real spiritual dangers that could prevent his entrance into the kingdom (Gal. 5:19-21; Heb. 3:12-14; 1 Jn. 2:24, 25; Rev. 22:19)..." (p. 78).

This is certainly true, but Corner is wrong about the "kingdom" in these verses. Paul, in Hebrews, explains that he is discussing the "world to come" (Hebrews 2:5). This is the Millennium. It is the "seventh-day rest" (Hebrews 4). Furthermore, Paul uses the phrase "the kingdom" in 1 Corinthians 15:24-25, in reference to the Millennial kingdom. Therefore, Corner and others have the responsibility to prove that the kingdom means the absolute eternal age in various warning passages to believers. Paul speaks of temporary loss to unfruitful believers, while still retaining eternal salvation (1 Corinthians 3:15). This fits perfectly with the view that the Millennial kingdom is a reward for overcoming in practical righteousness, while eternal life in the eternal kingdom is a free gift by faith alone.

Next Corner discusses various Bible verses that promise eternal life, or warn against losing it. He writes:

"Please note, unlike many in our day, Paul neither said of those who shipwrecked their faith: 'They were never really saved to begin with' nor did he say, as others do, that such were still saved, because they once had a moment of faith." (p. 79)

Yet, we might add, that neither does Paul say that these people will be damned eternally in an Arminian sense. Â Corner writes:

"To OSAS proponent who believes in an absolute and guaranteed entrance into God's kingdom based upon a past moment of real faith in Christ, there will be some shocking Bible passages cited and examined...[Here are the] awkward passages on eternal life." (p. 80, 81)

Indeed, I do not know how OSAS proponents who believe in an absolute and guaranteed entrance into God's kingdom even read their Bibles! But the world is filled with people that can live in denial and unresolved contradictions in doctrine. Corner simply needs to understand that the kingdom is not always the eternal kingdom. His view blasts the whole foundation of justification by faith! Therefore, there is middle, true ground between these two extremes. Eternal security (OSAS) is absolutely true, and is easily defended, once the truths concerning the Millennium are inserted into the mix.

Corner next lists Daniel 12:2, Matthew 25:46, Mark 10:30, Romans 2:7, Galatians 6:8, 9, Titus 1:2, 3:7, etc. In other words, he lists the various Bible verses that offer eternal life as a reward for faithfulness and as something that can be lost by believers. His point is that no Christian is guaranteed eternal salvation in the eternal kingdom.
Corner errs by not realizing that often words such as "everlasting" can be used to describe the fullness of duration within an age or world. If they can be used in relation to this lifetime, in this world (Exodus 21:6), they may certainly be used to describe the fullness of duration within a whole millennium (i.e. the next world).

Even so, it is not necessary to limit the words "eternal" and "everlasting" in Bible verses that present "eternal life," etc., as a reward to faithful saints. Every saint will experience the fullness of eternal life on the last day, when the eternal age begins. But only some will enter into it 1000 years earlier, when the Millennial kingdom begins. Experiencing this eternal life (i.e. never dying again) at the Second Coming is often presented to the saints as a prize:

1 Timothy 6:19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

Galatians 6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

In other words, every saint that does not lay hold on eternal life (in the world to come, the Millennium) will be raised only to be banished to the realm of darkness and death until the end of the Millennium. They will not experience everlasting life at the Judgment Seat of Christ. All saints possess the free gift of eternal life, to begin on the last day after the Millennium. But the prize or reward of eternal life is the promise of entering this wonderful state as a first-born son (i.e. 1000 years earlier than the rest of the sons).

Corner notices that eternal life is often called a "hope." Most of these verses are describing the prize awarded at the Second Coming. In regard to others, Corner should realize that the word "hope" does not always mean that an expectation is uncertain (Acts 2:26-27).

Corner scorns the interpretation of Galatians 6:7-9 offered by Charles Stanley (that it refers only to the gaining or losing of Kingdom rewards). Corner reveals that the loss is everlasting life and destruction. But these penalties are very consistent with my view. The destruction of an erring "saint" is only Millennial. The destruction of a "lost sinner" is Millennial AND absolutely eternal (i.e. during the never-ending, eternal age). Corner errs by missing the qualifications given by the Bible:

Luke 18:29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for THE KINGDOM of God's sake,
30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and IN THE WORLD TO COME life everlasting.

Corner wrongly believes that the "world to come" is the eternal age or state! But the world to come is actually the Millennium (Revelation 20:1-6). The promise for disciples who will confess Christ and forsake all is everlasting life in the Millennial Kingdom! They will not have to wait until the general resurrection at the Great White Throne, after the Millennium. They will have part in the first resurrection (Philippians 3:11).

AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO ALL THE FATHERS:

FAMILY WORSHIP IN THE HOME: THE MAN'S DUTY

The man should be leading his home, and should not take a backseat in regard to holiness and Bible knowledge. Scriptures should be read and studied regularly in the home. The husband and wife should also interact regularly by discussing the Scriptures. The following Scriptures reveal that the man in the home is called to lead his wife and children spiritually:

1 Corinthians 14:35 And if they will LEARN any thing, let them ask their HUSBANDS at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

Ephesians 6:4 And, ye FATHERS, provoke not your children to wrath: BUT bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

1 Timothy 3:4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.

Genesis 18:18 Seeing that ABRAHAM shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
19 For I know him, that he will COMMAND his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

Genesis 35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
2 Then JACOB said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

Deuteronomy 11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

Joshua 24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and MY HOUSE, we will serve the LORD.

Psalms 78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should MAKE THEM KNOWN to their children:

Proverbs 4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a FATHER, and attend to know understanding.
3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.

Job 1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that JOB sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job CONTINUALLY.

It is the man's responsibility to gather the family together at the appropriate time for worship in the home. He must keep order during this sacred time. Therefore, the common excuse, "It is her fault that we don't have regular devotions in our home" is not justified. The man is the leader and he is responsible before the Lord to lead and rule his home. The wife is commanded to submit. The husband is commanded to love. In explaining this Biblical love, the Holy Spirit reveals that the husband's duty is to wash his wife with Scripture (Ephesians 5). To neglect to wash the wife with Scripture is as sinful as the wife refusing to obey her husband.

GEORGE WHITEFIELD ON FAMILY WORSHIP
"And this will appear, if we consider that every governor of a family ought to look upon himself as obliged to act in three capacities as a prophet, to instruct: as a priest, to pray for and with; as a king, to govern, direct, and provide for them....For if, as the apostle argues, he that does not provide for his own house in temporal things has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel, to what greater degree of apostasy must he have arrived who takes no thought to provide for the spiritual welfare of his family?" (George Whitefield, "The Great Duty of Family Religion")

"THE ROYAL PATH OF LIFE" ON FAMILY WORSHIP:

"A prayerless family cannot be otherwise than irreligious. They who daily pray in their homes, do well; they that not only pray, but read the Bible, do better; but they do best of all, who not only pray and read the Bible, but sing the praises of God....The influence of family worship is great, silent, irresistible and permanent. Like the calm, deep stream, it moves on in silent, but overwhelming power. It strike sits roots deep into the human heart, and spreads its branches wide over the whole being....It affords home security and happiness, removes family friction, and causes all the complicated wheels of the home-machinery to move on noiselessly and smoothly. It promotes union and harmony, expunges all selfishness, allays petulant feelings and turbulent passions, destroys peevishness of temper, and makes home intercourse holy and delightful. It causes the members to reciprocate each other's affections, hushes the voice of recrimination, and exerts a softening and harmonizing influence over each heart....Its voice has sent many a poor prodigal home to his father's house....The child, kneeling beside the pious mother, and pouring forth its infant prayer to God, must attract the notice of the heavenly host....But in order to do this, the worship must be regular and devout, and the whole family engage in it....It must needs be that trials will enter a household. The conflict of wishes, the clashing of views, and a thousand other causes, will ruffle the temper, and produce jar and friction in the machinery of the family. There is needed then, some daily agency that shall softly enfold the homestead with its hallowed and soothing power, and restore the fine, harmonious play of its various parts. The father needs that which shall gently lift away from his thoughts the disquieting burden of his daily business. The mother that which shall smooth down the fretting irritation of her unceasing toil and trial; and the child and domestic that which shall neutralize the countless agencies of evil that ever beset them....See what home becomes with religion as its life and rule....Compare an irreligious home with this, and see the vast importance of family worship. It is a moral waste; its members move in the putrid atmosphere of vitiated feeling and misdirected power. Brutal passions become dominant; we hear the stern voice of parental despotism; we behold a scene of filial strife and insubordination....Domestic life becomes clouded by a thousand crosses and disappointments; the solemn realities of the eternal world are cast into the shade...the sense of moral duty distorted....Natural affection is debased, and love is prostituted to the base designs of self....Let yours, therefore, be a religious home; and then be sure that God will delight to dwell therein, and His blessing will descend, like the dews of heaven, upon it....And then in the dark hour of home separation and bereavement, when the question is put to you mourning parents, 'Is it well with the child? is it well with thee?' you can answer with joy, 'It is well!'" (1882)

REBELLING AGAINST THE ROD

"At first - but only at first - the intensity with which this truth is opposed in spite of its convincing evidence, perplexes us. But it is not always a difference in judgment only. It is deplorable how stoutly the heart can resist after all the batteries of the intellect have been put out of action; 'the motive being the desire to get rid of all responsibility in the case of Christian believers. This is a grievous error, and those who propagate it will bitterly regret their folly when they stand before the judgment seat of Christ.' (G. H. Pember) Truth that powerfully rouses and stimulates the Church, is truth which also rouses powerful opposition; and doubtless Satanic energies operate behind the antagonism, together with the strong distaste of the flesh, and the cold cynicism of the world. All our resistance to revelation springs from sin in the heart or life; truth that
touches the spot stings." (D.M. Panton, "Rapture," 1922)

"I was there but one night, and stressed the solemn side of the judgment seat of Christ, saying the very things that dear brethren in this land so often resent."
(G.H. Lang)

RIGHTLY DIVIDING FORGIVENESS OF SIN

Every Christian has the ETERNAL debt of sin paid in full. This is the forgiveness of a LOST SINNER which makes the sinner a SON. But when a SON sins, this sin may no longer merit an eternal penalty. But mystical antinomians and modern, Gnostic psychobabblers refuse to admit that God recognizes SIN in the saint! They refuse to see that the saint is responsible for his or her actions and that there are temporal consequences for evil conduct both here (1 Cor.11) and at the judgment seat (2 Cor.5:9-11).

Some teach that a Christian cannot sin "greatly," and that the "little sins" still in the saint are simply a result of GOD withholding His grace. Therefore, there can be no consequences for sin since these little sins are God's fault. But this is a misuse and abuse of the doctrine of God's sovereignty. Others teach that these little sins are the old man's problem, and that the new man is certainly not responsible for them. But we simply answer that the Christian who failed to "put on" the new man is the one who is responsible (Ephesians 4:23-24)!

Notice the Scriptures that teach that New Testament believers must still seek forgiveness for the sins they commit as SONS:

James 2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
25 But HE THAT DOETH WRONG shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

1 John 1:9 If WE confess our sins, he is faithful and just to FORGIVE us our SINS, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

Luke 11:4 And FORGIVE us our SINS; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us...

"To say that they [believers' sins] are to be recognized as sins, and yet that no acknowledgment is to be made, and no forgiveness sought for them, is a statement so monstrous as to carry its own refutation."
-B.W. Newton (1807-1899)

"It is not the sinner who is in view, but the failing believer. If we will not forgive, we cannot be forgiven (Mark 11:26). This is an unalterable principle in God's government of His family. When a believer has SINNED and seeks restoration, he is forgiven as he forgives. This is not the same thing as the justification of a sinner, which is by faith alone....what we have here is the Father's forgiveness when His own children fail, and if we forgive not our brethren then the Father will not grant us restorative forgiveness."
(H.A. Ironside, "Addresses on Luke")

"The term 'forgive' is used in two senses in the Scripture. There is forgiveness in the sense of God's daily approval and fellowship of people already saved...The term is also used of salvation, in the sense that all our sins were laid on the Lord Jesus...One who has trusted Christ for salvation has his sins already forgiven, AS FAR AS HIS ETERNAL DESTINY IS CONCERNED....Dr. Scofield here, in the older Scofield Bible notes on this passage [Luke 11], is mistaken..." (John Rice, Commentary on Luke)

So many of God's children have become very confused and rebellious in these last days. They don't even ask God for forgiveness as SONS! This is the day of God's long-suffering. Yet, in 1 Corinthians 11, God made some saints sick, and others He killed for not discerning the Lord's Body in the Supper! What then will God do to Christian sinners on the day of judgment when Paul says we can experience the terror of the Lord (2 Cor.5:9-11)? The Holy Spirit provides a remedy, if we will pay attention to it:

1 Corinthians 11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
31 For IF WE WOULD JUDGE OURSELVES, we should not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

If we would examine our lives by the Word and confess our failings, and beseech God for mercy, He would not have to judge us. But some despise His chastenings. These unfaithful sons do not confess their sins and ask God for mercy. They boast that they are no longer responsible for sin, in any sense; they use the truths of justification in eternity as a buffer against any doctrine of accountability. Stripes will surely be waiting for them at the Judgment Seat.

WHICH CHURCH IS THE RIGHT CHURCH? A simple four page tract by Dr. J.G.
Williams, veteran missionary to New Zealand. This tract targets Roman Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists by using their own comments (that they are the "only true church") against them. These quotes are used as a lead in to the fact that no church/denomination can you get you to heaven - the ONLY WAY is Jesus Christ. We have found this tract to be extremely effective as it makes
the point without getting into emotionally based arguments - what cultist can argue against documented quotes from his own organization? For full text of tract and online ordering information, see our website (Verity &amp; Charity Publications) at www.veritycharity.com!

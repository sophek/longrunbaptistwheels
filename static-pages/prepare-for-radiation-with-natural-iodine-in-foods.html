        <h1>PREPARE FOR RADIATION WITH NATURAL IODINE IN FOODS</h1>

            <blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/science/17plume.html?_r=1"></a>â€œA United NationsÂ forecast of the possible movement of the radioactive plume coming from crippled Japanese reactors shows it churning across the Pacific, and touching the Aleutian Islands on Thursday before hitting Southern California late Friday.Â Health and nuclear experts emphasize that radiation in the plume will be diluted as it travels and, at worst, would have extremely minor health consequences in the United Statesâ€¦â€

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/science/17plume.html?_r=1" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/science/17plume.html?_r=1</a></blockquote>
God will soon destroy those who destroy this earth (Rev. 11), and not only is mankind destroying the earth by his wicked sins, he is also destroying it by his continual manipulation of Godâ€™s creation.

Now we have nuclear fallout with radiation spewing forth everywhere. And if not this time, Â and this may be a sign of the future, since more terrible storms and earthquakes are coming, and also there will be wars and rumors of wars, etc.

When radioactive, toxic iodine is released, and it is breathed, it can accumulate in the thyroid gland, damaging the thyroid and causing cancer, etc. (this shows the insanity of using radiation to kill cancer!).

The idea behind taking iodine is so the thyroid will â€œfill upâ€ with the good iodine so it will not take in the toxic iodine. The thyroid needs iodine to make hormones.

Iodine pills can be harmful. Americans have gone pill crazy. And when things are isolated away from their natural foods and forms by the drug companies, they will always have destructive side effects.

For example, notice the â€œside effectsâ€ and warnings by Anbex for their Iosat (Iodine pill):
<blockquote>â€œTake potassium iodine (KI) only when public officials tell youâ€¦Too much KI may INCREASE the chances of side effectsâ€¦You should not take this drug for longer than you are toldâ€¦Possible side effects include: swelling of the salivary glands, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache, fever, headacheâ€¦allergic reactions can include: skin rashesâ€¦swellingâ€¦fever with joint painâ€¦trouble breathing, speaking or swallowingâ€¦ [Iodine] may cause over-activity of the thyroid gland, under-activity of the thyroid gland, or enlargement of the thyroid glandâ€¦â€</blockquote>
Always remember, these are the side effects that have been legally forced to admit. In the above warnings they are careful to say that taking more than 1 pill in a 24 hour period may INCREASE the dangers of side effects (carefully implying that you may receive side effects if you only take 1 pill). They also admit that the thyroid can be damaged from taking this iodine, even if you are not allergic.

So what is the answer? Pray, and then fill up your iodine need with iodine rich foods. Fish (sea), Â fish oil, yogurt, raw milk (especially from grass fed cows), are very rich in iodine. It is also found in eggs, strawberries and beans (navy, etc.).

Kelp and other sea vegetables have very large amounts (too much) of iodine, but they also usually have other toxins â€“ much more than fish.

Eating healthy foods will also help protect other parts of the body. Iodine tablets alone will offer no help to the harmful effects of radiation on other organs, etc.

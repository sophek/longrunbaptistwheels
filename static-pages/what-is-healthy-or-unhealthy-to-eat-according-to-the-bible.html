        <h1>WHAT IS HEALTHY OR UNHEALTHY TO EAT ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            This is a lighthearted article I wrote that might be of some help in these confusing times. In these days when there is so much talk about what we should or should not eat, I am thankful that I have the light of Scripture. The Bible is not primarily written to show mankind how to eat. However, whatever statements it makes on the subject are inspired by God Himself. The Bible often teaches about physical food as an illustration of spiritual food. One thing therefore lies at the forefront of this issue: Whenever man tries to diminish, take away or add to God's Word, it leads to spiritual weakness and spiritual sickness (Col.2:8). In the same way, by analogy, whenever man adds to or strips real food of its nutrients, it leads to physical weakness or physical disease. It is hard to imagine God allowing it to be any other way. Food is often a picture of the Word of God or its truths. Man thinks he can "improve" upon God's spiritual truth. Thus, we have scientism, psychobabble, scientific fables, etc. that bring nothing but spiritual disease and destruction. Man also thinks he can "improve" upon what God ordained for man to eat physically. But such "improvements" bring only physical affliction and disease. This article is not meant to be an outright endorsement of a "Jewish" diet, under the Mosaic Law. Although, I will admit, in general (for physical reasons, not spiritual) I try to adhere somewhat to this diet. To teach that a person is SPIRITUALLY unclean for eating pork or shellfish is to teach LEGALISM. But I am one of those people that have to "wonder" if there isn't something messed up about those unclean animals "physically." Then we hear all these doctors and nutritionists telling us that many of these animals are God's natural "sewer system." Hmmm! God told Moses to command the people to be WASHED with running water and ashes after touching a dead body (Numbers 19). This referred to spiritual uncleanness. Yet, centuries later, doctors found out that there was a PHYSICAL reason, as well. I can't help but wonder if there are not physical reasons for abstaining from unclean foods. I know all creatures are now "good" (1 Tim.4:4). But does that refer to "spiritual" goodness or "physical" goodness? Let each be persuaded in his own mind. For me, I must confess that I like how ole' Lester Rolloff dealt with it all: "Are you saying I can't get to Heaven if I eat this pig?" "No, actually, I am saying that if you eat that old dirty pig you'll get there a whole lot faster!" Seriously, the issue of what to eat is not limited to a discussion over whether or not there is physical "wisdom" in the Mosaic diet. Any Christian can use the WHOLE Bible to glean clear guidance in regard to dietary decisions. This wisdom of the Bible will prove to be years (if not centuries) ahead of modern nutritional study (just as it is ahead in every other realm of scientific study). The following is a dietary guide, straight from the Bible, that is hardly ever seen, even in Christian health books (which are often guided more by medical study than Bible study). Use it for what it is worth to you. (I think I am supposed to put a disclaimer here: Check with your doctor - you may not be allowed to eat real food anymore): 1. Bread is good for you: Luke 11:11 If a son shall ask BREAD of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?... Psalms 104:15...BREAD which strengtheneth man's heart. Bread (in those days) was made from whole grains. It was not stripped of its nutrients to make it last on a store shelf or so it would look pretty. It did not have added chemicals, high fructose corn syrup, etc. 2. A LITTLE Grape Juice is good for you: Ps 104:15 And WINE that maketh glad the heart of man... 1Ti 5:23 ...use a LITTLE WINE for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. This is pure juice (Isa.65:8), not fermented juice, which is poison. It was also pure juice without pesticides and added sugars, chemicals, etc. 3. Fish is good for you: Matthew 7:10 Or if he ask a FISH, will he give him a serpent? (How many kids today BEG their parents for fish or bread as a "treat"?) John 21:13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and FISH likewise. 4. Eggs are good for you: Luke 11:12 Or if he shall ask an EGG, will he offer him a scorpion? An "egg" is called a "good gift" (Lk.11:13). These eggs came from free-ranging chickens that ate worms and bugs they could catch. They did not come from chickens that ate pesticides, that had been shot up with hormones or antibiotics. Why is it that when you raise chickens in your yard, the eggs scramble up orangy and dark yellow in the pan? Why aren't store-bought eggs this color when you cook them? Nutritionists that say eggs are bad for normal people, are simply behind the times. 5. Roasted Lamb is good for you: Luke 22:15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this PASSOVER with you before I suffer: This was not a lamb fed with pesticides, and shot with hormones and antibiotics. 6. A little Honey is good for you: Proverbs 24:13 My son, eat thou HONEY, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: Proverbs 25:16 Hast thou found HONEY? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. Isaiah 7:15 ...HONEY shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. Proverbs 25:27 It is not good to eat much HONEY... This was not processed honey. If we are not to eat too much honey (which is a sugar with natural vitamins), how much more should we refrain from refined sugars with NO vitamins? 7. Butter is good for you: Isa 7:15 BUTTER and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. (see also 2 Sam.17:29, Gen.18:8) This was not "margarine." It was made from cows without hormones, etc. etc. (you get the picture). 8. Cheese is good for you: 2 Sam. 17:29 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and CHEESE of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness. This is cheese without colorings, flavorings, preservatives, chemicals, etc. made from cows without hormones, etc. 9. Vegetables and beans are good for you: Ex 12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with BITTER HERBS they shall eat it. (They say the "bitter" herbs, have more vitamins - like the wild, bitter greens). 2 Sam.17:28 ....parched corn, and BEANS, and LENTILES, and parched PULSE, (see also Dan.1:12-15). These beans and vegetables were organic, without pesticides, etc. 10. Olive oil is good for you: Det. 8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of OIL OLIVE, and honey; 11. Meat is good for you: Neh. 5:18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one OX and six choice SHEEP; also FOWLS were prepared for me... 1Kin. 4:22 And Solomon's provision for one day was... 23 Ten fat OXEN, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside HARTS, and ROEBUCKS, and FALLOWDEER, and fatted FOWL. Heb 5:14 But STRONG MEAT belongeth to them that are of full age... This is not meat with hormones, etc. etc.... 12. Milk is good for you: Gen.18:8 And he took butter, and MILK, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. This is not milk made from cows with hormones, antibiotics, pesticides etc. Nor was it "homogenized." Many people are allergic to milk sugar (lactose). These are the people who always have bad breath (hydrogen gas). Do them (and everyone around them) a favor and tell them to lay off the milk! Sometimes the argument is made that "cow's milk" is for baby cows and goat's milk is for baby goats. etc. (not humans). Yet, this is somewhat silly. The grass that cows eat is not "intending" to grow to be swallowed up by some cow. It is trying to grow more grass! If we apply this strange principle consistently we would have to refrain from everything in nature. Nothing grows with a tag on it that says "Human food." It all has another purpose. 13. Fruit is good for you: Num. 13:23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of GRAPES, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the POMEGRANATES, and of the FIGS. These are fruits without wax, pesticides, etc. Closing Thoughts: It appears that, for the most part, all FOOD is good for you! It is man's "contribution" to food that stinks it all up. People sometimes ask me, "What do you EAT?" I try as much as possible to eat FOOD. (It is getting harder and harder to do these days.) In regard to real food, the Bible does caution against too much sugars. The OT warns against DIRECTLY eating fats (Lev.3:17). But this was fat trimmed off meat. The Bible endorses olive oil, real butter, milk, etc., which all contain healthy fats. It appears from the Bible that it is wise to eat carbohydrates (grains, etc.) WITH proteins (meats, beans, etc.). And finally, gluttony makes any food bad for us (Luke 21:34, Pr.23:21).

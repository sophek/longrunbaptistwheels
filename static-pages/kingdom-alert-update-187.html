We cannot ally ourselves with either enemy of God's truth:</P><BR>  <P>Isaiah 8:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces...</P><BR>  <P>We greatly need to remember the above warning in our day. In the previous article on this subject, I documented how the Devil used the threat of Roman Catholicism to tempt fundamental Christians to throw their children into the clutches of Unitarianism and their new public schools. Notice the words of some other commentators on this subject:</P><BR>  <P>"For years, it appeared the only strong advocates of state schools in America were the Unitarians of Boston, who denied Christian doctrines and accepted Rousseau's philosophy that negative behavior in society was a result of mis-education - not man's fallen nature. The Unitarians felt that man, who was essentially good, could be saved from the evils of society if he were properly educated....The educational system which was in place was obviously working very well. The majority of Americans were not interested in replacing it. But the Unitarians would not be stopped. Eventually the resolve of the majority began to dissolve as the push for state education continued....In spite of the success that had accompanied individual, missionary, and church educational endeavors, many Christians, encouraged by the Unitarians, began to look longingly toward the state school..." (Susan Adler, "Education in America," Libertyhaven.com) </P><BR>  <P>The Unitarians themselves write:</P><BR>  <P>"There are probably more public schools named for Horace Mann than any other figure in our nationâ€™s history, with the likely exception of George Washington. This honor is well deserved, for Horace Mann was the founder of public schools in America. Not everyone realizes that this important person in our nationâ€™s history was a Unitarian....Through the mentoring of one of the greatest Unitarians of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, William Ellery Channing, Horace Mann developed a theology that recognized the possibility for goodness that existed in all people....Unlike what some people think, the privilege of receiving a free education paid for by tax dollars is not written into the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, or even in the bill of rights. The commitment to the idea of public education emerged slowly over generations before and after the first public schools instigated by Horace Mann....Unitarians and Universalists have always valued education. It is a crucial part of who we are as a religious people."&nbsp; ("The Spirit of Public Education," A Sermon by Barbara Wells, co-minister, Paint Branch UU Church, October 7, 2001)</P><BR>  <P>Surely, the submission to Unitarian public education, after a generation, greatly encouraged the acceptance of Unitarian modernism in the Christian colleges and seminaries. Unitarianism and modernism are essentially the same thing:</P><BR>  <P>"Since there is almost complete harmony between the Modernists and Unitarians, it may be well to note the doctrinal teachings of Unitarians, as showing what Modernism is. This statement is taken largely from 'Modern Religious Liberalism,' by John Horsch: 'The Unitarians derive their name from their denial of the trinity of God and the deity of Christ.' They believe 'The doctrine of the sinfulness of man to be a mere figment of the imagination and a source of evil....They are of the opinion that a great moral reformation would result from the rejection of the Biblical doctrine of sin and the acceptance of the idea of inherent human goodness.' The fact is, Unitarians teach that regeneration is not needed to implant the divine life, nor is divine grace needed for the development of life. They teach 'that the natural religion which every person possesses is sufficient for salvation.' According to Unitarians, 'the divine is naturally in man, even in the most degraded and depraved, and it may be developed by natural means, just as the oak is developed from the acorn....'...'Unitarianism is belief in the humanity of God and the divinity of man.' They have no creed and exclude no one from fellowship, because of doctrinal opinions.' They 'are not kindly disposed to the old evangelical faith. They devote their church energies to combating Biblical orthodoxy....' The Unitarian organ, 'The Christian Register,' says editorially, April 15, 1920: 'In all denominations, there is a liberal wing in which the theological differences between them and us is almost nothing.'" (J. M. Stanfield, "Modernism," 1927)</P><BR>  <P>At this point, a really strange thing occurred. After a whole generation of children were brainwashed by ecumenical modernism, fundamental Christians then began to turn to Roman Catholicism as an ALLY in standing against the new threat! To escape the invasion of Roman Catholicism, many Christians had joined with the Unitarians in launching public education. Then, once the monster of Modernism had matured and manifested herself (having being well-fed), many Christians fled to ROME as an ally against it!</P><BR>  <P>In a 1907 "Encyclical," Pope Pius X (1903-14) denounced the writings of some of the "modernists." He supposedly coined the term "modernism." At this point, in the 20th century, many orthodox Christians began to perfume Rome. They SOFTENED their reproofs, and some even associated themselves with Catholicism to battle the new enemy of modernism. </P><BR>  <P>Observing the compromises with Rome occurring around him in 1924, premillennial prophecy writer, D. M. Panton, wrote:</P><BR>  <P>"Profoundly as we are convinced of the ultimate rebuilding of [literal] Babylon...equally profoundly we hold the Papal character of Babylon the Mystic in Revelation xvii....standing as we do on the THRESHOLD OF A RE-ABSORPTION INTO ROME NOW GROWINGLY ADVOCATED IN NEARLY EVERY QUARTER...." ("The Dawn," Aug. 15th, 1924)</P><BR>  <P>Again, in the same year, he wrote:</P><BR>  <P>"The astounding action of the Archbishop of Canterbury in authorizing 'conversations' with the Papacy - a huge stride Romeward - has the approval of great numbers in the Anglican Church....We are confronted once again with the easy leniency which is a fruit of deep ignorance both of the human heart and of the Roman See. Mr. Rattenbury, for example - a foremost Weslyan - says: - 'How is it possible for any body of men who represent one Church of Christians to ignore the existence of what, after all, is the largest body of professing Christians? Is it absolutely incredible that there should be a change of heart in Rome?'...So the ship of faith, sucked by currents of world-opinion inconceivably powerful, drifts rapidly towards the Roman reef....M. Camille Hysmans, the secretary of the International Socialist Conference, said recently in Belgium: - '...the day that the Church becomes MODERNIST I will return to the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church.' So the end hastens..." ("The Dawn Magazine," May 15th, 1924)</P><BR>  <P>Thus, we see that "modernism" tempted many to flee into Rome's consoling bosom! Even the more orthodox, in contending with modernism, tasted the intoxicating wine of Rome. For example, J. Gresham Machen (1881-1937) wrote:</P><BR>  <P>"Yet how great is the common heritage which unites the Roman Catholic Church, with its maintenance of the authority of Holy Scripture and its acceptance of the early creeds, to devout Protestants today! We would not indeed obscure the difference which divides us from Rome. The gulf is indeed profound. But profound as it is, it seems almost trifling compared to the abyss which stands between us and many ministers of our own church." ("Christianity and Liberalism")</P><BR>  <P>"Authority of Holy Scripture"!? There was no ground or need to perfume Rome in this manner. She was not at all worthy of Machen's compliment. The paganism that wears the best disguise is the most dangerous. Machen, however, was not a premillennial fundamentalist. He disliked the term "fundamentalist" and much that was associated with it (calling himself a "Calvinist" instead). Yet, he was identified with the fundamentalists against modernism, and his words are representative of this first move within Protestantism to attempt warmer relations with Rome.</P><BR>  <P>Even some popular fundamentalists staggered with some degree of spiritual intoxication. For example, William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925), in his 1923 defense against modernism, wrote:</P><BR>  <P>"I am defending ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY as it is understood and accepted by the Roman Catholic Church and by all the Evangelical branches of the Protestant Church." ("Orthodox Christianity Verses Modernism")</P><BR>  <P>Is Roman Catholicism "orthodox Christianity"!? Webster defines the word "orthodox" as meaning "sound in the Christian faith" (Webster's 1828). Clearly, even fundamental Christians were softening their rebukes against Rome in an attempt to ally themselves with her against modernism. Therefore, today's modern compromise between evangelicals and Catholics had its roots in this earlier compromise between fundamentalists and Catholics. </P><BR>  <P>The Devil used the threat of Roman Catholicism to feed modernism. Then, he used the threat of modernism to feed Roman Catholicism! The Unitarian movement (modernism, liberalism, neo-orthodoxy, etc.) is a religion that exalts man and diminishes the glory of God. It is essentially paganism merged with nominal Christianity. It therefore mixes well with Roman Catholicism, which is essentially the same thing (though more organized). Today, both monsters are alive and well on planet earth. They are both happy giants. And, of course, they have now linked hands together against fundamentalism. </P><BR>  <P>We must not make any alliances with liberalism or Roman Catholicism (which are now rapidly becoming the same system of "Christianized" paganism). The Devil will surely raise up more "threats" to Christian fundamentalism to tempt Christians to ally themselves with this pagan system with its form of godliness (2 Timothy 3:1-5). But let us fight our battles alone, fearing God, with His help:</P><BR>  <P>Isaiah 8:10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought...</P><BR>  <P>12 Say ye not, A confederacy....neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. </P><BR>  <P>13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let HIM be your fear, and let him be your DREAD. </P><BR>  <P>14 And he shall be for a sanctuary... </P><BR>  <P><STRONG>THE INFIDELITY OF HENRY C. VEDDER</STRONG></P><BR>  <P>Henry Clay Vedder (1853-1935) was professor of Church History at the American Baptist Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania (1894-1926). Earlier, he was a writer and editor for "The Examiner" and "The Baptist Quarterly Review." He is perhaps best known among modern Baptists as the author of "Short History of the Baptists" (1907), which contains some commendable documentation. The following quotes reveal the extent that a man's mind can be taken captive by Satan under the banner of "relating to modern man" and being "progressive." Henry C. Vedder writes: </P><BR>  <P>"....deliverance of a soul is not a mechanical thing; it is a spiritual process that cannot be accomplished by sacrifices or sacraments. It is quite in accord with human indolence that men should look for a salvation to be accomplished in something done for them....The ideal of Jesus is a salvation accomplished by men, not for them, from within, not from without....there is no authority in religion, nothing fixed, unalterable, infallible; because religion is life, and life is growth, and growth is change."</P><BR>  <P>(Dr. Henry C. Vedder, "Fundamentals of Christianity," 1923)</P><BR>  <P>"There is no educated man living who really believes the Bible from cover to cover."</P><BR>  <P>(Quoted in "Who's Who in Modernism," from "The Fundamentalist," May 15, 1924, by John Roach Stratton)</P><BR>  <P>"Of all the slanders men have perpetrated against the Most High, this doctrine of his substitutionary atonement is positively the most impudent and the most insulting. Jesus never taught and never authorized anybody to teach in his name that he suffered in our stead and bore the penalty of our sins." (Quoted by R.T. Ketcham, "The Answer")<BR></P><BR>  <P><STRONG>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH CALLS THE KORAN GOD'S WORD</STRONG></P><BR>  <P>PRESIDENT: "...it is my honor to visit the Islamic Center of Washington once again... I am pleased to join you today in the celebration of Eid, the culmination of the Holy Month of Ramadan....Islam traces its origins back to God's call on Abraham. And Ramadan commemorates the revelation of God's word in the Holy Koran to the prophet Mohammad - a word that is read and recited with special attention and reverence by Muslims during this season."</P><BR>  <P>(www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/12/20021205-5.html, Dec., 2002) </P><BR>  <P>Comments: Shame! There is never a justifiable reason for compromising religious truth. A fervent defense of religious liberty in America, even for Muslims, certainly does not necessitate the denial of the unique claims of the Lord Jesus Christ. </P><BR>  <P><STRONG>"THE BIBLICAL EVANGELIST" RESPONDS TO "THE ROD"</STRONG></P><BR>  <P>I have not seen Dr. Robert L. Sumner's recent review of my book. I plan to get it next week. I have been told that I made front page and that it is quite extensive. From what I hear, he stumbles over the supposed similarity between Millennial exclusion and Catholic purgatory. In short, if a Christian can be chastised by being killed or made sick in this life (as all affirm - see 1 Corinthians 11), and this is not called "Purgatory" in this day of God's patience, then why would temporary, negative consequences on the day of God's JUDGMENT be called "Purgatory"? Catholic purgatory does not just refer to "temporary punishment." It refers to EARNING salvation through suffering. Two whole chapters of my book document this difference extensively. I do hope Sumner's review answers my main argument to this foreseen, emotional (though rational and worthy) objection. We shall see!</P><BR>  <P>**********************<BR><STRONG>ANNOUNCEMENTS<BR></STRONG>**********************</P><BR>  <P><STRONG>JOIN WILEY DRAKE IN MONTGOMERY</STRONG> </P><BR>  <P>"As many of you know The Honorable Chief Justice Roy Moore was on my show for </P><BR>  <P>an entire hour Dec. 5, 2002.

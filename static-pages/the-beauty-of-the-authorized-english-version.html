            "But now if thou wilt have me do battle and fight, make the other Trojans sit down and all
the Achaians, and set ye me in the midst..."
(The Iliad of Homer, Book III, p.47, translated by Andrew Lang, Leaf, and Myers, 1883)

It is interesting that translators chose the majestic English (as found in the King James Bible) for their translation of the ancient Greek poem by Homer. Their translation was published in 1883. Obviously, the English of the King James Bible is beautiful and magnificent. It demands respect and awe. Notice the words from the Introduction to the English translation of the Iliad:

"Such a language was never spoken: it was a slow work of art like the English of our King James Bible...in order to prevent the tone from falling too far below the grandeur of the original, these translators adopted a stately prose style which they drew from the King James Version of the Bible..."

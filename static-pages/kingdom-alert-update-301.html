Some have asked how they can help: Please pray, and please help spread the promotion link above to as many people as you can. Also, we are making some improvements to our building - we need a foyer area, and some kitchen supplies, etc. If the Lord leads you to help financially, it will be a blessing. We have been told that the work can be completed in two days if we raise the funds. The donation information is at the bottom of this newsletter.

Please pray for our work, ministries and coming conference. I mean this sincerely, since I know that the Lord has chosen to work in power, through the prayers of others:

Hebrews 13:18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.

FIRE:

Two sisters in our church (a young widow with a daughter, Miss Kristi and Kayla, and one of our S.S. teachers, Miss Debra) have had a fire in their apartment building, in Arlington. Thankfully, they got the news that their apartment was burning, directly after church (so no one was hurt). They lost almost everything. Please pray for them. And if you would like to help them financially, you may send a gift to our church with a note to whom the funds are for. Or, you may email me for their postal address.

RECENT SERMONS:

The Prophecy Watch (New Years' Eve) sermon is online (http:www.kingdombaptist.org). I examine the latest stage-settings signs that occurred in 2007. I also show how "Catholic prophecies" (through "Mary," etc.), are deceiving the world, teaching that the comings of Jesus and the Antichrist are centuries away! We end with an examination of recent developments concerning the European Union.

Some other recent sermons are "The Ultimate Purpose" (an examination of how Warrenism's and his "Purpose Driven" movement, compared to what the Bible reveals is our ultimate purpose). The latest sermons in the Book of Ephesians and the Book of Proverbs are also online. Thank you for listening! Pray the Lord will use these teachings to His glory.

(Sermons are also found at SermonAudio.com).

WHAT IS THE LORD'S KINGDOM?
*********************************

(A RESPONSE TO THOMAS WILLIAMSON, BY JOEY FAUST)

In the "Northern Landmark Missionary Baptist" (January, 2008), Thomas Williams (Illinois) has greatly erred concerning our Lord's Kingdom. In his article "Christ Sets Up His Everlasting Dominion - Daniel 7," Mr. Williams writes on Daniel 7:13-14:

"These verses predict that the Messiah will come and set up a Kingdom and a dominion that is everlasting. . .It is very important for us to know just when this event tales place. If Christ set up His everlasting dominion at His first advent, then we are in that kingdom now. . .This great kingdom represented as a mountain that will fill the whole earth and never be destroyed, will be set up 'in the days of these kings.' Which kings?. . .If God did not keep that promise during the time of the Roman Empire, then it is too late for the prophecy to be fulfilled, because the Roman Empire is completely dead and gone. . .We are now in that kingdom which was promised in Daniel 2:34-35 and 7:13-14'"

Certainly, the Lord's "kingdom," in one sense, is presently in Heaven; God is presently ruling in the affairs of men (Ps. 103:19). Therefore, Mr. Williams has simply restated the Lord's sovereignty which has been exercised from before the foundation of the world. Nebuchadnezzar discovered this eternal sovereignty the hard way:

Daniel 4:17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High RULETH IN THE KINGDOM OF MEN, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.

34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, WHOSE DOMINION IS AN EVERLASTING DOMINION, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

Jesus Christ has ascended to this heavenly throne (Rev. 3:21). But is the heavenly sovereignty of the Lord all that Daniel has predicted? The ascension of the Lord Jesus to the right hand of the Father was certainly a necessary precursor; however, it was not the fulfillment of the great stone that will fill the whole earth!Ã‚

Williams wonders how the prophecy of the kingdom could now be fulfilled since the Roman Empire has ceased to exist. He forgets that his fellows in doctrine used to wonder how the "kingdom of Israel" could literally be established with Israel out of the promised land! But upon the return of many Jews to the land (in unbelief), they should have learned a great lesson! God's sovereignty is able to resurrect whatever is needed for the fulfillment of a promise or prophecy!

For example, Jesus once promised that not one hair of His saints would perish:

Luke 21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. . .

18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

How could such a thing be true? While we know the Lord protects us in the midst of our trials (unless He calls us to martyrdom, etc.), the promise is literally and fully true in resurrection!

Therefore, the same God that raised up Jesus from the dead to fulfill prophecy is the same God that can raise up His people; raise up Israel; and raise up the Roman Empire again!

The arguments of Mr. Williams may have had an appearance of plausibility in the old days before Napoleon. But so much has happened since that time, that it should be obvious to any unbiased observer that the Roman Empire is being restored today in the European Union. Israel is in their land in unbelief, and the stage is set for the European Union to grow in power.

The "beast" is said to be both the coming leader and the coming kingdom itself (Daniel 7:23). The "kingdom" must, therefore, rise again:

Revelation 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a BEAST RISE UP out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns. . .

Revelation 17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit. . .

Williams has missed the fact that Daniel sees TWO stages of the Fourth Kingdom (Rome):

Daniel 2:32 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

Notice, four kingdoms are symbolized by the body of the image:

1. Head.

2. Breast and arms.

3. Belly and thighs.

4. Legs and feet.

We learn that the Fourth Kingdom will be smitten upon its final FEET (not legs):

Daniel 2:34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon HIS FEET. . .

42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed. . .

Has the Roman Empire ever, yet, existed in its feet (ten toes) stage? The Apostle John tells us (long after Christ has ascended) that in his day the FEET STAGE of the Roman Kingdom was not yet in power:

Revelation 17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, WHICH HAVE RECEIVED NO KINGDOM AS YET; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.

13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and THE LAMB SHALL OVERCOME THEM: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

Therefore, the STONE (the Lamb!) has not yet "overcome" the FEET (ten toes or kings), because these kings have not yet arisen to make war with Jesus! They were not yet in power at the time John wrote the Book of Revelation. The Lord's Kingdom (in this since), has not yet arisen.



Joseph of Arimathaea was still waiting for the STONE OF THE KINGDOM to be established after the Lord was crucified:

Mark 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which ALSO WAITED FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

The Apostles were still waiting for the Kingdom after the Lord's resurrection:

Acts 1:6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou AT THIS TIME restore again THE KINGDOM to Israel?

7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

This question came after Jesus had been teaching them throughout a period of forty days about this subject of the kingdom!:

Acts 1:3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the KINGDOM of God:

Therefore, the "kingdom" is not Jesus reigning in Heaven over the universe. It is Jesus reigning in Jerusalem in the restored Davidic Kingdom. Jesus did not tell His disciples that this kingdom would never arise, or that they were wrong about the nature of the kingdom. He told them that it was not given unto them to know the times or seasons, and that they would be empowered to witness.

These Apostles did not think that the kingdom had already been set up in their day. They were still WAITING for GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will to be done on EARTH as it is done in HEAVEN:

2 Timothy 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;

The kingdom is said to be established when the Lord appears. It will be the time of resurrection or translation for the saints who shall inherit it:

1 Corinthians 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the KINGDOM of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

The kingdom arises on earth only when certain future signs have come to pass:

Luke 21:24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

31. . .when ye SEE THESE THINGS come to pass, know ye that THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NIGH AT HAND.

If the STONE was supposedly established in the earth at the first advent, then why did Jesus say the kingdom would be nigh at hand only when Israel was trodden down of the Gentiles, and the signs in the heavens culminated in the coming of Jesus? Even the erroneous, Preterist interpretation has the kingdom established in 70 A.D. But this is long after Jesus ascended. But Williams appears to be laboring to show that the kingdom was established when the Lord's churches were established (years before 70 A.D).

There is another problem for the interpretation advocated by Mr. Williams. The kingdoms in Daniel 2 were each literally conquered. Babylon was conquered by Media/Persia, and its government was totally dismantled. Greece overthrew the Persians, and Rome conquered Greece. If the Lord's kingdom has already been established, then why are the wicked still abundant in the earth? Why are they still empowered?

SOME OBJECTIONS ANSWERED

Mr. Williams makes mention of a few apparent proof-texts, most of which have been answered in my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" in the chapter, "Millennial Counterfeits." But we will take another look at them here:

The first proof-text that Williams uses is in Matthew 28:

Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

This does not mean that the Lord is presently exercising this power in the exact way that He will exercise it at His appearing. In this day, it is the time of the Lord's patience, where He causes the wrath of man to praise Him. Jesus has been given the title-deed to the coming Kingdom. We can presently pray in His name for anything we need to fulfill our responsibilities until His appearing. But He is not yet seated upon David's throne, with all of his enemies destroyed.

The second text that Williams uses is Matthew 13:

Matthew 13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:

32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

With Norris, Riley and others, I believe that these verses do not represent "apostate Christendom" (though the Bible does teach there will be an apostate Christianity in these last days). The mustard plant actually often grows to become the greatest among "herbs." Birds have actually been seen in the branches of this wonderful herb.

The parables of the mustard seed, and the three measures of meal, teach us that the kingdom will first be preached in word-form (Matthew 13:11,19), with power; it will be hidden in the hearts of men, and in the work of the Lord's churches, until the time when the signs of its manifestation appear. The spreading of the leaven does not represent the gradual growth of a Christianized earth, but the preaching of the Gospel of the Kingdom in all the world. The growing tree, etc. represents the fulfillment of prophecies in relation to the Kingdom (as described by the Lord in Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21). After the rapture, the Tribulational signs will increase until the sign of the Son of Man appears in the sky.

The third text provided by Williams is John 18:36:

John 18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

This is a sad proof-text for a Baptist to use in this manner. Does Mr. Williams believe that John's baptism was IN heaven?:

Matthew 21:25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?. . .

It was obviously on earth, but it was "of" heaven. The Lord's coming kingdom is not "of" this world. It is in the coming, Millennial age, and it will not gradually arise in the kingdoms of men; it will arise from Heaven, and destroy the kingdoms of this world:

Revelation 11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD are become the KINGDOMS OF OUR LORD, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

The fourth objection is based on the fact that the Millennium is temporal, and the STONE kingdom is said to be an everlasting kingdom. However, the Millennium is part of the eternal kingdom that will be established by Jesus. What Daniel sees in a general sense, as one kingdom, John sees in two parts, the Millennial age, and the Eternal age. The eternal throne is merged with the Millennial throne when the Lord appears. Although the Millennial Kingdom is temporal, Jesus will reign on earth on the throne of David, forever. He sits on this throne at the start of the Millennial Kingdom. And He continues to rule from this throne when the new heaven and earth arise for all eternity.

The fifth objection that Williams raises in based on Colossians 1:13:

Colossians 1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

Williams argues that the kingdom is said to be already present. Govett and others argue that the kingdom first arises in mystery form, and then, later, in its manifestation. Indeed, we did see John the Baptist arise as a spiritual Elijah; yet Jesus assures us, after John had died,Ã‚Â  that Elijah will literally appear in the future (Matthew 17:11). Therefore, the pattern is first a typical fulfillment, followed by the literal fulfillment of prophecy. (We see this pattern in Joel's prophecy fulfilled partially and typically at Pentecost in Acts 2. Yet, Joel will also be literally fulfilled in the coming Tribulation age).

George N.H. Peters argues in regard to Colossians 1:13, that the Bible is simply calling those things that be not yet, as though they already were. This is common in Scripture (Romans 4:17, Genesis 20:3, Proverbs 5:5, etc.).

Along this line, we should notice that Paul says that believers are presently seated with Jesus in Heaven (Ephesians 2:6). In this sense, we are translated into His kingdom, since we are identified with Him, as His body. But since Jesus does not stay in Heaven, His Kingdom comes to this earth, and His will shall be done on earth as presently it is done in Heaven.

Regardless of which of the above interpretations we follow, the one thing that is not true is that Jesus is presently reigning on the throne of David in final fulfillment of Daniel 2, 7, etc.!

Lastly, Williams argues that Jesus is presently seated upon the throne of David. He writes:

"As a result of Christ rising, ascending to the Father and being seated on David's throne at God's right hand (Acts 2:29-36). . ."

The verses he references in Acts are as follows:

Acts 2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.

30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;

31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.

32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. . .

These verses only state that Jesus is "raised up." They do not teach that He is presently sitting on David's throne. David's throne was on earth, in Jerusalem. That is where the Antichrist will sit in order to counterfeit and blaspheme Jesus (2 Thess. 2). Jesus has been raised up for the purpose of possessing David's throne and kingdom in fulfillment of prophecy. This purpose will not be thwarted. Jesus will return, and will literally reign in Jerusalem, on the throne of David. Jesus Christ is at the right hand of God the Father. He is presently on the Father's eternal throne. This eternal authority will be moved to earth at the appearing of Jesus, where it will remain throughout the Millennium, and the eternal Kingdom. When the Lord appears, He will also reign in His own Millennial glory:

Luke 9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come IN HIS OWN GLORY, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.
The same Lord who suffered on this earth, will return in glory, and sit upon the throne of David.

How amazing it is that spiritualizers would arise when the stage is being set as never before for the fulfillment of literal prophecy. But the Bible predicted this strange set of circumstances:

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

Let us look for the Lord's appearing at any moment!

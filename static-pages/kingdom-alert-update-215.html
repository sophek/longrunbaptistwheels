THE BIBLE'S SCIENTIFIC FOREKNOWLEDGE (PART 3)Â 

"All human discoveries seem to have been made, only to confirm more and more the truths of the Bible."
(Sir John Herschell, 1792-1871)Â 

The Lord has provided multitudes of amazing proofs in this past century to anyone who is willing to see them. In spite of the confirmatory signs and miracles at Christ's first coming, the truths of the Scriptures were rejected by the majority. Therefore, the reluctance of proud, rebellious man to receive the following proofs is to be expected. Only a few wise men came from the east, observing the star our Saviour's birth. However, for anyone with eyes to see, the following items are magnificent proofs for the inspiration of the Scriptures!Â 

These wonderful scientific proofs are only part of the proofs for inspiration. The Bible is filled with DIRECT prophecies which the Lord has ordained as primary grounds of inspiration (Isaiah 41:21-24, 42:9). And the inspiration of Scriptures is continually confirmed by many archeological discoveries. But the scientific foreknowledge of the Scriptures is especially awe-inspiring in light of the openly arrogant and rebellious nature of MODERN science (falsely so-called). We have come a long way (down!) since an earlier generation of scientists signed the following declaration:Â 

"We conceive that it is impossible for the word of God, as written in the Book of Nature, and God's Word written in the Holy Scripture, to contradict one another, however, much they appear to differ. We are not forgetful that physical science is not complete, but is only in a condition of progress, and that at present, our finite reason enables us only to see through a glass darkly; and we confidently believe that A TIME WILL COME when the two records will be seen to agree in every particular."
(617 members of The British Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1865)Â 

Previous articles have examined the following examples of inspiration:Â 

1. Differing time zones (daylight on one side of the earth, while it is dark on the other) [Luke 17:30-35]Â 

2. Fire beneath the earth [Luke 10:15, Matthew 18:9]Â 

3. Digging technology: ability to place colonies beneath the earth [Amos 9:2, Philippians 2:10, Revelation 5:3]Â 

4. Space technology: ability to place colonies in outer space [Obadiah 1:4, Deuteronomy 30:4, Mark 13:27]Â 

5. The earth hangs upon nothing [Job 26:7, 38:4, 6]Â 

6. The water cycle (rivers, and evaporation) [Ecclesiastes 1:7, Amos 9:6, Psalms 135:7]Â 

7. Stars too numerous to count [Jeremiah 33:22, Deuteronomy 4:19]Â 

8. Implant (microchip) technology [Revelation 13:16]Â 

9. Wind circuits [Ecclesiastes 1:6]Â 

10. Ocean currents [Psalms 8:8]Â 

11. The moon shines by reflected light [Job 25:5, 31:26]Â 

12. Satellite television technology [Revelation 11:9-10]Â 

13. Air has weight [Job 28:25]Â 

Upon the last example (#13), L. Merson Davies writes:Â 

"Here is striking case of the Bible anticipating science, for the fact that the atmosphere has WEIGHT was a thing absolutely unknown to science until about the year 1643, when some Florentine gardeners found that they were unable to pump up water higher than 33 feet....It was left to...[Galileo's] pupil, Toricelli, to discover the true solution, i.e., that pumping powers could be better explained by attributing WEIGHT to the atmosphere....Thus, we now speak of barometric PRESSURE (for air, in common with all fluids, exerts pressure, according to its weight, in all directions); but even Galileo had had no idea of this fact, which was nevertheless mentioned in the ancient Hebrew Scriptures from before the days of Moses, and had actually APPEARED IN OUR A.V. TRANSLATION A GENERATION BEFORE GALILEO! For remember that the very English of Job [28:25], as we now have it, was in existence some 32 years before science admitted that the air had weight....And note the PECULIARLY SIGNIFICANT CONNECTION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE WINDS AND THEIR WEIGHTS; for it is simply the difference in WEIGHTS, bulk for bulk, between various masses of air that causes movement between them. 'Weights' are thus truly necessary 'for' winds, exactly as Job implied."
(L. Merson Davies, "The Atmosphere," 1927)Â 

Let us now notice some more examples which glorify our Lord and His
Scriptures:Â 

******************************************************Â 

14. THE EARTH IS THE EXACT SIZE TO SUPPORT LIFEÂ 

******************************************************Â 

Isaiah 45:18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he FORMED IT TO BE INHABITED: I am the LORD; and there is none else.Â 

Job 38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
declare, if thou hast understanding.
5 Who hath laid THE MEASURES the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?Â 

The Bible teaches that God has made the earth a CERTAIN size. Why would this matter? Davies explains:Â 

"...one might well be tempted to ask here, Why the ancient writer should ever have counted it among the MORE IMPORTANT works of God that He settled the size of the earth? To a savage, a particular size could have little enough significance: to him, the bigger the earth the greater its importance. Yet we are not asked who made the earth so big, but who determined its measures....This is indeed a scientifically significant question....Douglas Archibald points out in his book "The Atmosphere," that whether or not a globe 'ceases to possess a liquid or gaseous covering, and becomes like the moon, or still retains an atmosphere and oceans like our earth, depends on the attraction (gravity as we term it) by which it holds its gaseous portions to it. This, again, directly depends on the amount of matter it contains, and therefore UPON ITS SIZE....The fact, therefore, that we possess at the present time a gaseous atmosphere of exactly the particular degree of tenuity [thinness] that suits our breathing apparatus, remarkable though it may seem, is a direct consequence of the particular size of the globe on which we stand.' Note that he does not say it is a direct consequence of the 'great' size of the earth - for if the earth was greater still, the consequent atmosphere would certainly not suit us - but of a particular size; and this he describes as a 'remarkable' fact. we may, therefore, surely claim a 'remarkable' aptness in the ancient Bible reference to this same particular size of the earth!" (L. Merson Davies, "The Physics of the Bible," 1927)Â 

***************************************************************Â 

15. WATERS ARE ALSO IN EXACT PROPORTION AND BOUNDSÂ 

****************************************************************Â 

Job 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he WEIGHETH THE WATERS BY MEASURE.Â 

Psalms 33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together AS A HEAP: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.Â 

Isaiah 40:12 Who hath MEASURED THE WATERS in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?Â 

Jeremiah 5:22 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the BOUND of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they NOT PASS over it?Â 

Job 38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?Â 

The waters of the earth are in exact amount and proportion:Â 

"He has exactly proportioned the aqueous surface of the earth to the terrene parts, for the purpose of evaporation, etc." (Torrey, "Treasury of Scripture Knowledge")Â 

"Such then, would some of the results be if our earth were only slightly smaller....It seems, however, that the results would be even more drastic if the earth were slightly bigger than it is!....Dr. Wallace points out that if our terrestrial waters were to be increased by only one-tenth, practically our whole land surface would cease to exist, everything being covered with water....The wonder, indeed, is that the sea does not cover everything even now....the facts show us that an earth which is big enough to have exactly the right amount of atmosphere for us, is so big that its consequent oceans would, if the earth had a smoothly rounded surface, cover that surface to an uniform depth of two miles everywhere. How comes it, then, that we have so much land surface as we actually enjoy?....in spite of the enormous amount of water on our globe we have...just the right proportion of land surface to water surface. (E.g., if our water surface were much more or less than it is in proportion to land, the latter would be proportionately over or undersupplied with rainfall in consequence, EVAPORATION BEING IN PROPORTION TO WATER SURFACE. This is only one of the many adjustments concerned). But in order to provide the extensive land surface which we require, the portions of the earth's crust devoted to water are made up of astonishingly and abruptly deep ocean basins....How these immense ocean basins were ever formed, is one of the most perplexing problems of science....How they were so exactly filled, and no more, that...an increase of even 10% in the water would have overflowed the land, is another mystery [to many modern scientists]."
(L. Merson Davies, "The Terrestrial Waters," 1927)Â 

**************************Â 

16. SPRINGS IN THE SEAÂ 

**************************Â 

Job 38:16 Hast thou ENTERED INTO THE SPRINGS OF THE SEA? or hast thou WALKED in the search of THE DEPTH?Â 

Spring: "A flow of water rising or issuing out of the earth..." (Oxford)Â 

This is a magnificent example of Biblical inspiration. Springs were discovered only recently:Â 

"Interest and excitement peaked in 1977 with the discovery of the Galapagos deep sea hot springs..." (<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.yoto98.noaa.gov/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.yoto98.noaa.gov/</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

"This exciting discovery was not really a surprise. Since the early 1970s, scientists had predicted that hot springs (geothermal vents) should be found....Since 1977, other hot springs and associated sea life have been found at a number of sites along the mid-oceanic ridges, many on the East Pacific Rise. The waters around these deep-ocean hot springs, which can be as hot as 380 Â°C, are home to a unique ecosystem." (pubs.usgs.gov)Â 

"Before 1930 little was known about the ocean floor....In the 1960's metal-rich, hot brines were discovered using sonar in the bottom of the Red Sea. This brine was an indirect evidence of water coming out of the ocean floor....first direct observations of deepsea springs, or their mineralized vents, appear to have been made on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by Project FAMOUS in 1973. Spectacular hot springs were then discovered on the Galapagos Rift in the Pacific Ocean by the 23-foot long submersible Alvin in 1977....discovery of ocean springs ranks as one of the foremost scientific accomplishments of the last ten years. Let us remember, however, that their existence was known thousands of years ago. Surely, God spoke through men by means of His Holy Spirit." (ICR.org)Â 

"With only about 5 PERCENT of the sea floor explored in detail, a picture is emerging of a vast system of natural undersea dynamos, fueled by HOT SPRINGS, that produce not only valuable mineral deposits, but habitats for unique, heat-loving organisms that can provide materials for products ranging from detergents to pharmaceuticals. That is the view of marine geologist and geophysicist Peter A. Rona of the department of geological sciences and the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey....He published an overview of current work entitled 'Resources of the Seafloor' in the international journal Science Jan. 31....'Before the discovery of plate tectonics the oceans were thought of as BIG BATHTUBS,' he said. 'NOW WE KNOW that the earth's crust, most of it under the ocean, is cracked into plates that move and allow heat and materials from the earth's interior to escape. As result we know that most of the minerals on the sea floor probably come from sources under the sea floor.' In fact, Rona said, there is probably as much water circulating UNDER the sea floor as there is in the oceans themselves....When it reaches hot layers in the mantle, the water heats and rises with force, dissolving metals from surrounding rocks and BLASTING OUT of the sea floor at 650 degrees Fahrenheit....'Miles down, the ocean is an extremely hostile environment. Sea water is corrosive; the pressures are huge. It's analogous to exploring outer space in terms of a hostile and alien environment,' he said..." (Spacedaily.com, Feb. 10,
2003)Â

17. AIR IS MOVED BY LIGHTÂ 

****************************Â 

Job 38:24 By what way is the LIGHT parted, which SCATTERETH the east wind upon the earth?Â 

Sunlight is obviously associated with heat:Â 

Revelation 7:16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the SUN LIGHT on them, nor any HEAT.Â 

Genesis 1:5 And God called the LIGHT DAY, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.Â 

Genesis 18:1 ...and he sat in the tent door in the HEAT OF THE DAY;
16 And God made TWO great lights; the greater light to rule the day...Â 

James 1:11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat...Â 

Psalms 19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for THE SUN,
6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from THE HEAT thereof.Â 

"Why any connection at all between light and any wind?....It is difficult to see what facts he could have had to go on, if we are to find a naturalistic explanation for his statement; yet that statement is remarkably true to what is known as modern science....The SUN'S EMANATIONS ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WINDS OF THE EARTH....but how did the writer of Job come to know of it?" (L. Merson Davies, "The Physics of the Bible," 1927)Â 

"Winds are caused by the sun's uneven heating of the Earth."(eww.bchydro.bc.ca)Â 

"Wind is caused by the sun heating up different parts of the Earth at different rates."
(<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.rbwm.gov.uk"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.rbwm.gov.uk</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

"Winds are caused by the Sun. When the Sun warms up the oceans they warm the air around them causing the air to get stirred up. This creates wind....Air movements have patterns called doldrums. There are 4 major patterns....Few people know that the moon and Sun also cause air tides.Â 

Just as the moon and Sun affect the water of the oceans, they also affect the air of the Earth's atmosphere. Gravitational attraction causes large bulges of 'air tides' just like water tides. Air tides are also called lunar winds. Even though they are too slight to be felt or seen, lunar winds cause dramatic variations in weather conditions."
(<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.library.thinkquest.org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.library.thinkquest.org</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

This physical truth (that light causes heat, and therefore wind) is also a spiritual truth. The Lord desires His people to be hot:Â 

Revelation 3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.Â 

If His people will be hot, the must be in constant touch with the Word of God which is our light:Â 

Psalms 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.Â 

It is only by humble meditation on the Scriptures that the revival winds of the Spirit will blow in our lives and in our churches. Yet, today, many churches have replaced Scripture with entertainment, psychology, comedy hour, and everything else but the light of the Word. There is therefore no true heat, nor winds of holiness:Â 

"Certain therefore it was that they should feel the scourge of God, unless they should rouse themselves out of their lazy devotions, out of the hateful and dangerous temper of lukewarmness, unless they should blow up the fire of zeal, to love and worship God with all earnestness and fervency....Let us not then defer our repentance. Would we not have the flaming fire of Gods wrath and vengeance to consume us? Let us repent of our lukewarmness, and get this SACRED FIRE OF ZEAL, the only means to preserve us: Be zealous therefore and repent." (Joseph Mede, 1586-1638)Â 

**************************************Â 

18. EACH STAR DIFFERS IN GLORYÂ 

**************************************Â 

1 Corinthians 15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for ONE star DIFFERETH from another star in glory.Â 

"Humanity's understanding of the relative brightness and variability of stars was revolutionized by the work of Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868-1921)." (<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981027.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981027.html</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

The natural eyes of man can see some slight differences in brightness, color, etc. of a few stars. However, it is an amazing statement to claim that each star differs (especially when the Bile states that they are innumerable).Â 

It is important to realize that each Christian will differ in glory at the Judgment Seat. Some will be in shame, being naked. The amount of glorious light we possess in the millennium will be equal to the amount of obedience we have given our Lord in this life.Â 

*******************************************Â 

19. CIRCULAR SHAPE OF THE EARTHÂ 

********************************************Â 

Isaiah 40:22 It is he that sitteth upon THE CIRCLE OF THE EARTH, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:Â 

Circle: "..a round or spherical body." (Funk &amp; Wagnall's, "A Standard Dictionary," 1895)Â 

*******************************Â 

20. WATER IN SPACEÂ 

*******************************Â 

Psalms 148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye STARS of light.
4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and YE WATERS THAT BE ABOVE THE HEAVENS.Â 

The context is the second heaven (space). Is there water in space? If so, when did modern science understand this truth?:Â 

"1995 to 1998, the European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) tracked down signs of WATER VAPOR in the newest stars and some of the oldest stars, and even in the 'void' of interstellar space. Before the project shut down, ISO confirmed visual observations about water surrounding Mars and the Saturn moon Titan...." ("Space Water Found," <a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.goletawater.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.goletawater.com</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

"Water in Space More Abundant than Expected - New observations of selected regions of our Milky Way Galaxy show that WATER IS MORE ABUNDANT than expected. The new measurements show that water is the third most common molecule in the regions studied....The existence of huge amounts of water in many different regions was established four years ago."(Space.com, April 12, 2001)Â 

"Water Fountains in the Sky...Astronomers using the National Science Foundation's...[VLBA] radio telescope have found that an aging star is spewing narrow, rotating streams of water molecules into space, like a jerking garden hose that has escaped its owner's grasp." (June 19, 2002, <a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.nrao.edu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.nrao.edu</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

"Astronomers have known FOR DECADES that there is a lot of water in space..."
(<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.nai.arc.nasa.gov"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.nai.arc.nasa.gov</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

We are pleased that they have known this truth for decades. (This is like the boasting statement that they have known "since the seventies" that there are springs in the sea). However, our amazing Bible has known these truths for many centuries!Â 

**********************************Â 

21. LIGHT IS NOT STATIONARYÂ 

**********************************Â 

Job 38:19 Where is THE WAY where LIGHT dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the PLACE thereof,Â 

"Note, it does not say, Where is the PLACE where light dwelleth? This would have been scientifically wrong, as light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, and so could not possibly dwell in one place.Â 

Here then we have an exact scientific statement regarding light fully 3000 years before any scientist knew sufficient about light to know that it could not dwell in one place. What is the explanation? The Bible is God's own Book."
(T. J. McCrossan, "The Bible: Its Christ and Modernism," 1925)Â 

*****************************************Â 

22. CELESTIAL BODIES EMIT SOUNDSÂ 

*****************************************Â 

Job 38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
7 When THE MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?Â 

The first and foremost principle of Biblical interpretation (after a prayerful, humble, obedient, seeking heart) is to take the Scripture as literal and normal as possible, unless it is unbiblical or absurd to do so. But in obeying this principle, we must give the Lord room to work outside of our narrow vision. Many literalists thought it would b absurd to think that the eyes of all nations on earth could behold the bodies of the two witnesses for three and half days! We now know better. We must also realize that spiritual, secondary applications do not overthrow primary, literal applications. Because John the Baptist was an application of Malachi's prophecy concerning Elijah, did not mean that he was the ONLY application. Jesus assured us (after John was dead) that Elijah would certainly come in fulfillment of Malachi (Matthew 17:10-11). Therefore, the Scripture in Job says that STARS SING. The sons of God are the angels, etc. The stars are stars!:Â 

"Oct. 5, 1915, Dr. Lee DeForest announced to the world that he had made electric lights play for him music...thus we know that light can give forth musical sounds. But the Bible knew this scientific truth hundreds of years ago. Psa. 65:8, 'Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.'...Then in Job 38:7 (1500 B.C.), we read, 'When the morning stars sang together.' This expression has often been quoted as a sample of the unscientific nonsense of the Bible; but now we know this is but another proof that the Bible is far in advance of man's thought, for light does produce musical sounds. We cannot hear this music of the stars, but God can, and WE WILL SOON be able to do so. In the Scientific American of Nov. 1924, is a most interesting article by Fred M. Delano, Jr., on the theme, 'Listening to the Stars.' He says in part: 'Suppose, a few months from now that you are listening at your radio receiver somewhere in France for the nightly time signal....As the zero hour approaches you will hear in your telephone a clear musical note. That is the music of a star....This is the real purpose and accomplishment of the much-discussed new method of 'hearing starlight' developed by two French scientists and radio experts...'....Reader, God has placed these wonderful truths in this Book for the one express purpose of convincing us that the Bible is indeed His very own Word to man."
(T. J. McCrossan, "The Bible: Its Christ and Modernism," 1925)Â 

McCrossan had so much faith in His Bible and literal interpretation, that he knew that science would soon be able to present to us the sounds of the stars. Today, any child can log onto the web and can hear the sounds of the sun!:Â 

"February 27, 1998....Sounds of the Stars....Around the world, astronomers scan the skies with telescopes that look not at visible light, but at RADIO WAVES....The Very Large Array is just that - a very large array of twenty seven radio antennas in the New Mexico desert....Using the VLA, scientists from around the world can LISTEN to the faint radio signals emitted by distant stars..." (<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.sciencefriday.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.sciencefriday.com</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

"One story has to do with the AUDIO STREAMING FROM THE STARS. It has been known for some time that the SUN PRODUCES SOUND - deep, pulsating vibrations that emanate from beneath its surface. As astronomers seek out and find stars similar to our sun, they TUNE IN to their unique sounds."
(<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.newscientist.com/weblinks/categories/news1.jsp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.newscientist.com/weblinks/categories/news1.jsp</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â

"1931...Radio waves from outer space discovered, leading to radio astronomy, Karl Jansky....1947...Radio waves first discovered to originate from objects, Crab Nebula Australia, John Bolton" (<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.bookitprogram.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.bookitprogram.com</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

"The only conclusion that Jansky could draw was sufficient to boggle the mind. For the temporal pattern of radio noise no terrestrial cause could he find. The static, he reasoned, must come from beyond, emanating from quite far away. We NOW know the sound was the SONG OF THE STARS at the center of our Milky Way."
(H. Paul Shuch, Ph.D.)Â 

"For hundreds of years, astronomers have concentrated their observations IN THE VISIBLE portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Windows into the Universe, other than the visible window, were SUSPECTED by astronomers and scientists as EARLY AS the Nineteenth Century, but remained unobserved until an accidental discovery in 1932.....[Earlier] Edison [in 1890] reasoned that since the Sun was seen to produce disturbances in visual light, these disturbances might also radiate at radio wavelengths....Jansky's successful experiment in 1932 provided the spark that was to eventually ignite the science of radio astronomy."
(David J. Babulski, "Radio Astronomy: A Historical Perspective,"
<a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.seds.org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.seds.org</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

Psalms 148:3 Praise ye him, SUN and MOON: praise him, all ye STARS of light.Â 

According to Psalms 148:3, we can know (even before examining science) that the moon is also emitting sounds! And of course, science confirms this truth:Â 

"The following is a summary of some of the major events in the history of radio astronomy:Â 

1932 - Karl Jansky discovers radio emissions from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy... 1942 - Radio emissions from the Sun are detected in England and the United States.Â 

1945 - RADIO EMISSIONS FROM THE MOON ARE DETECTED...Â 

1949 - The Crab Nebula...a supernova remnant, and two galaxies are identified as emitters of radio signals.Â 

1955 - Radio bursts from the planet Jupiter are detected...Â 

1981 - Completion of the VLA (Very Large Array) in New Mexico..."
(David J. Babulski, "Radio Astronomy: A Historical Perspective," <a href="http://www.kingdombaptist.org/www.seds.org"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">www.seds.org</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">)Â 

If the sun and moon and stars praise the Lord audibly, how much more should we who have MOUTHS praise our Lord? Have we not seen wonderful things? Is not His Bible amazing? Let us shout it from the rooftops:Â 

Psalms 150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.
2 Praise him for his MIGHTY ACTS: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.Â 

Exodus 4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth?...Â 

Let us repent where needed, and then lift up HOLY hands with shouts of praise to our Lord this Lord's Day!Â

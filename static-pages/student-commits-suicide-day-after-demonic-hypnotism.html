â€œNorth Port, Florida â€“ Sixteen-year-old Wesley McKinleyâ€™s suicide  onÂ April 8Â is raising questions about whatÂ happened one day after his  principal, Dr. George Kenney, hypnotized him.

â€œTheyâ€™re blaming him for his death,â€ says Bianca Cannon a senior at North Port High School.

â€œHe was doing it for good, not telling Wesley to harm himself,â€ explains student Danielle Leopold.

Students say Kenney, a certified hypnotist and author, helps a lot.

â€œItâ€™s no big deal. He does it for kids that need help with exams and  the stress of school. A lot of seniors do it, it helps them with  finals,â€ says Biancaâ€¦.â€™</blockquote>
Hypnosis is demonic. It is divination. It is called â€œcharmingâ€ in the  Bible. The Bible warns against â€œcharmersâ€ and classes them with  witches, etc. People are given a barrier so that devils cannot control  their minds. Hypnotism, like other eastern mystical rituals, etc., break  this barrier. It is wrong, and it will lead to evil spirits destroying  life.

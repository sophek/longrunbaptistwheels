            When will people learn that sin, in the end, doesn't pay? God is not mocked. When Mississippi voted to legalize casino gambling, they decided to put the casinos out on the water (that way they could make the money, but wash their hands of the moral problem). Now, they have found that much of the hurricane damage in Mississippi was caused by casinos that had become flying missiles on the land! The very casinos they had hoped to enrich themselves with, had become their chastisement:

Proverbs 5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.

"Katrina May Lead to Miss. Casino Debate - JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - State leaders expect Hurricane Katrina's devastation to Gulf Coast casinos to prompt a volatile debate: Whether to allow casinos on land rather than over water, where the threat of monster storms is a constant gamble. The storm ripped jagged holes in some casinos and beached others, crippling the area's thriving tourist trade and erasing half a million dollars a day in tax revenue. In this conservative heart of the Bible Belt, legalizing gambling 15 years ago was an uneasy compromise that confined the glitzy casinos to dockside attractions along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. The arrangement kept gambling away from the churchgoing masses further inland. Religion will now play as large a role as economics or public safety in shaping the discussion of casinos' future....State Gaming Commission director Larry Gregory is pushing for land-based casinos, as are some casino executives. Leading lawmakers say they'll entertain the idea. Gary Loveman is chairman and chief executive of Harrah's, which runs the Grand Casinos in Biloxi and Gulfport. Part of the Gulfport Grand was ripped off its moorings during the hurricane and heaved onto coastal Highway 90. Part of the Biloxi Grand was tossed across the road. Loveman said putting casinos on boats never made sense. 'It's not simply an inconvenience,' Loveman said. 'It's a public safety problem.'....casino companies could gamble with their very existence in Mississippi if they push to change state law because gaming opponents could try to outlaw casinos altogether. 'This might be a good time to revisit the entire subject of legalized gambling in Mississippi,' said William Perkins, spokesman for the Mississippi Baptist Convention, a group whose membership makes up about a quarter of the state's 2.8 million population. House Gaming Committee Chairman Bobby Moak, also a Baptist, said it would be 'an economy wrecker' to eliminate an industry that employs thousands of people and pumps millions of dollars into the economy...."

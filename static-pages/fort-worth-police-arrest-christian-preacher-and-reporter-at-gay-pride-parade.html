        <h1>FORT WORTH POLICE ARREST CHRISTIAN PREACHER AND REPORTER AT GAY PRIDE PARADE!</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p align="JUSTIFY">Press Release:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fundamental News.com</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On October 1st, 2011, the homosexual community celebrated the fact that they were able to have their parade through downtown Fort Worth for the first time. Betsy Price, the Fort Worth mayor, was the grand marshal of the parade.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Christians from Kingdom Baptist Church, in Venus, TX, and Old Paths Baptist Church, in Roswell, NM, protested the parade, with Gospel preaching and Biblical warnings. At first, the Fort Worth police department attempted to deny the Christians the use of blow horns, stating that it was against city code. When challenged by the Christians to produce the code, the police backed down.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The parade ended in front of the Fort Worth Convention Center, where the homosexual organizers had prepared various booths, games, and a public area of celebration. The police formed a wall, facing the Christian evangelists, with their backs to the homosexuals (as if to protect the homosexuals from the preachers!). Various men preached to the homosexual crowd. Video shows one homosexual coming up to a preacher, in plain view of the police, and cussing, and getting in his face. He is beckoned to leave, and given a pat on the back by police. After a few minutes of preaching, a police woman (possibly homosexual) is seen discussing something with other officers. The police then come over to the preacher with the blow horn, and place his hands behind his back and cuff him, and place him into a police car (for about 45 minutes, until being taken to jail). Immediately after his arrest, a free lance reporter (I-reporter for CNN, who was neutral), becomes absolutely enraged. He takes the blow horn and begins to say that the homosexual had actually used the “F word”, and that the Christians had said nothing unlawful or profane. Police then arrested the reporter for repeating what the homosexual had said to the Christian! The crowd went wild in applause.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Amazingly, the police report tells an incredible story! It is pure fabrication! They make up a story about the preacher using profanity on the blow horn (saying the preacher said that the homosexuals should go and _____ themselves). They say they were alarmed at the speech. They then say that one homosexual complained about the speech, and that is when they decided to arrest the preacher. They then claim (unbelievably) that the reporter grabbed the blow horn and also began to say, “Like the preacher just said, why don't you all go and _____ yourselves!” This is all very amazing in light of the fact that there are close up videos of the whole affair!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The street preacher says nothing offensive. He is so close to the police that they could hear his words without the blow horn. But he used a blow horn, so no one could misunderstand anything he said. There is no profanity. Yet, the preacher was charged with disorderly conduct, due to offensive language over a blow horn.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When they arrested the street evangelist (a black member of Kingdom Baptist Church), the whole homosexual crowd erupted with cheers. The Christians (along with the reporter) do not intend to ignore this miscarriage of justice. Awhile back, the Fort Worth police were accused of discrimination for raiding a gay bar. They have been launching a campaign ever since, to show that they are homosexual friendly. Either this unjust arrest was another gift to the homosexual community, to pat it on the back, or it was simply a result of the rage of a lesbian police officer, who could not stand the Biblical preaching (or both).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Local Christian radio stations are helping to get this story out in the open. We hope more news media will help report this outrageous, clear denial of religious liberty and 1st Amendment rights. The preacher was arrested, and thrown in jail until 10:00 that evening. His rights to speak his mind against the homosexual community, in a peaceful, law abiding manner, were greatly infringed.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some of the preaching from this event has already been downloaded onto You Tube (search under Fundamental News, and Fort Worth Gay Parade, 2011).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The video of the arrest (and the preaching before it) has not yet been made public.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">P.S. There is no way the police can say that the alleged profanity of Mr. Robinson occurred some time earlier. The video recorded the whole thing; and also the police report claims that the profanity occurred right after the homosexual man uttered the profanity at Shaun. The profane homosexual man, who came close to assault was given a pat on the back. The preacher, who ignored it, and kept on exercising his rights, was arrested!</p>

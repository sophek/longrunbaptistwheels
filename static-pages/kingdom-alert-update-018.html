        <h1>THERAPY: MORE "GAS" POURED ON A RAGING FIRE! - KAU#018</h1>
        <div id="content">
            A recent article at ABCNEWS.com made the following observation:Â 
<blockquote>"In the early '60s, the television show Leave it to Beaver was a cultural icon. It was lily-white, suburban family perfection, the backdrop for the life of elementary school student, Theodore Cleaver, known as â€˜the Beaver.â€™ Anxiety in the Beaverâ€™s life came most often from earnest, often inept attempts to understand and cope with family and friends. On rare occasions such attempts landed him in the principalâ€™s office. Or perhaps his parents, June and Ward Cleaver, would be called in to talk to his teachers. But father, mother and mildly errant son certainly never went in for group therapy."</blockquote>
That was thenÂ .
<blockquote>Today, across the country, a handful of school districts are equipped not only to teach but to actively address their studentsâ€™ mental health problems, with on-campus counseling and group therapy. Not only the student, but parents and guardians are called into the process as well. To some, that smacks of unconventional, even unwarranted, intrusion into family life...'Suicide and homicide are major causes of death for adolescents in the United States,' says Kevin Dwyer, president-elect of the National Association of School Psychologists...'The mental health problems among students have become more complex and kids have more difficulties at an earlier age,' he asserts..." (By Herb J. O'Connor ABCNEWS.com)Â </blockquote>
<blockquote>Job 15:6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.Â </blockquote>
Psychologists, reporters, journalists, etc. are noticing that things have changed in the past 50 years. They are calling attention to the fact that children have more "problems" nowadays. Yet, what do you think they are going to do about it? You guessed it. Bring in more psychologists! How much holy sense does it take to realize that if things were better â€œbeforeâ€ psychology - and then cursed all to fiery hell â€œafterâ€ it! - you probably do not need MORE psychological counseling on the fire!?Â 

"But father, mother and mildly errant son certainly never went in for group therapy.â€ â€œThe mental health problems among students have become more complex and kids have more difficulties at an earlier age.â€ Do these things even remotely suggest something to you Mr. Counselors? Things were sure better before YOU showed up and replaced traditional SWITCHES with modern self-esteem quackery!Â 

â€œBut the traditional family is now gone. Children therefore need trained psychological counselors to replace the guidance they used to get from traditional families.â€ If the family is now gone, psychology helped dismiss it by exhorting couples to â€œget in touch with their feelingsâ€ and obey them. Psychology pretended to be â€œscienceâ€ and that was good enough for almost an entire generation that really wanted to sin anyway, but simply needed a credible excuse from the mental-health â€œprofessionalsâ€.Â 

If Christians do away with psychology in their lives, perhaps they will turn back to the Holy Bible, and in time, many will then begin to reap the blessings of marital fidelity and holy commitment. But as long as psychology is present, the Bibleâ€™s truths will appear outdated, unscientific, unprofessional, weak, too simplistic, etc.; God will not be feared, loved or trusted. And He WILL NOT tolerate competition from a heathen religion masquerading as a â€œscienceâ€ after He has sufficiently warned His people to beware of â€œscience falsely so-calledâ€. He will begin to therefore JUDGE His people:Â 
<blockquote>Hebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.Â </blockquote>
This diabolical problem is so entrenched into the fabric of American society that you will not find the great â€œconservativeâ€ reporters, writers, journalists or radio hosts discussing it. You will not even find the conservative CHRISTIANS discussing it. In fact, even many of the great â€œfundamentalâ€ ministries will not touch it!Â 

My wife opened a stack of some of the most "fundamental," Baptist-women's books in order to see what they had to say to Christian women who desire to separate from the WORLD and grow in Christ. Now understand, these are not the modern books for Christian women you would find in some watered-down "Christian" bookstore-chain owned by some Atheist. No, these are the books that teach women to wear long hair and wear feminine dresses and obey their husbands. And what do you think my wife finds throughout 99% of these books? PSYCHO-BABBLE! How to find self-worth, self-esteem, self-acceptance, self-security, self-significance, and self-self-self, etc. You know, the stuff from the â€œMEâ€ generation influenced by acid-heads, Eastern Mystical gurus, the Beatles, etc. The stuff that came from Nietzsche, Fromm, Jung and Lucifer. (NOT the King James Bible). It appears that many of our old-time â€œBaptistsâ€ are really "Babblers." Psycho-babblers, that is. It is not so much the fault of the various sweet pastorâ€™s wives who wrote such books. It is primarily the fault of Christian men who have not warned the churches from the pulpits. Yet, they profess to standing for that â€œold time religionâ€. If they are indeed going back to any â€œold timeâ€ preaching at all, it is the old-time, "liberal" preaching of people like Harry Emerson Fosdick back in 1922!:Â 
<blockquote>â€œAnother science [i.e. psychology] takes our varied and vibrant mental life and reduces it to its physical basis and states its laws...â€ â€œ...Democracy,...elevates us into self-esteem...We know more than our fathers did about the effect of heredity and environment on character...we are softer with ourselves...Undoubtedly, the new theology has helped to encourage this modern mood of self complacency.â€ (â€œChristianity And Progressâ€, Fosdick, p.66, 172, 173)Â </blockquote>
Fosdick swallowed the lie about psychology as a â€œscience," hook, line and sinker. Yet, even the liberal Fosdick was forced by his own conscience to draw back a bit and admit that the â€œnew theologyâ€ was causing complacency among Christians by making sinners into victims. He OBSERVED this, just like those in the aforementioned article observed it. Therefore, this alone proves that many modern â€œfundamentalistsâ€ are now, in many ways, more liberal than the early â€œliberalsâ€ themselves! They still havenâ€™t â€œobservedâ€ the danger of the new self-esteem teaching upon Christians.Â 

America has not replaced the mighty King James Bible (and the great â€œold time religionâ€ that is found within it) with new bibles. No. The new bibles simply function like the pretty crosses and priestly robes in a Catholic church. They are there to look pretty and give people an air of â€œspiritualityâ€, a â€œform of godlinessâ€ until they can get back to living for the cares and pleasures of this world:Â 
<blockquote>Gal.6:â€[4] Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody elseâ€ (NIV)Â </blockquote>
This verse in the NIV creates a logical absurdity. There is no such thing as â€œprideâ€ without comparing. The NIV replaces â€œrejoicingâ€ (KJV) in what the Spirit is doing in oneself, with â€œprideâ€ in oneself. The NIV is therefore a product of the â€œflower-childrenâ€ generation.Â 

What replaced the King James Bible and its â€œold time religionâ€ (that so blessed America at one time) was not new bibles as much as it was PSYCHOLOGY! New bibles are simply the rotten fruit of a psychological rebellion against God, His Word and His truth.. The RELIGION of Godless, Atheistic, Secular-HUMANISTS entered into the churches because pastors and other Christian leaders (in their arrogant â€œhaughtinessâ€) wanted to appear EDUCATED by quoting â€œscientistsâ€. They wanted to appear â€œmodernâ€ and â€œup with the timesâ€:Â 
<blockquote>Proverbs 16:18Â Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.Â </blockquote>
They did this even though the inspired apostle Paul warned them specifically what would happen in the LAST DAYS:Â 
<blockquote>2 Timothy 3:1Â This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.2Â For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.Â </blockquote>
Do you see what the above Scriptures teach? The problem with America, the world, will not be "low self esteem." The problem will be an outbreak of selfishness (â€œlovers of their own selvesâ€ vs.2) like never before in history! But how could â€œselfishnessâ€ become so widespread to such a degree? Easy. For the first time in history, pastors and other Christian teachers THEMSELVES are found POURING GAS ON THE HELLISH FLAMES of manâ€™s pride! How? By â€œsanctifyingâ€ pride on the unholy altar of â€œpsychobabbleâ€ under the guise of â€œscienceâ€. For the first time in history, the fundamental doctrine of the â€œChurch of Satanâ€ (the very â€œrockâ€ upon which that devilish â€œchurchâ€ is built) is taught in practically every pulpit in America every Sunday morning:Â 
<blockquote>â€œOnly if a persons own ego is sufficiently fulfilled, can he afford to be kind and complimentary to others, without robbing himself of his self-respect. We are a self- respecting, prideful people...we are Satanists!" (The Satanic Bible)Â </blockquote>
<blockquote>â€œDo love your neighbours as yourselves - but first be such as love themselves...you cannot stand yourselves and do not love yourselves enough...â€ (From Nietzsheâ€™s â€œZarathustra,â€ W. Kaufmann)Â </blockquote>
<blockquote>2 Timothy 3:14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knowing of whom thou hast learned them</span>;Â </blockquote>
Go ahead. Mock this. Laugh it off. Say the Satanists do not mean what YOU mean. The fact is (if you are one of the millions across America teaching this dung), you are caught â€œred-handedâ€. Busted. There you are, preaching the primary, foundational doctrine of the Church of Satan; the principle doctrine of the philosopher that inspired Hitlerâ€™s murdering mayhem! And you are not a liberal sodomite. You are not even a Democrat. You are supposed to be one of the â€œgood guysâ€ bringing us back to those â€œgood old daysâ€. Face it; nothing will even partially change until YOU begin preaching responsibility, accountability AND true, unadulterated, CHRISTIAN HUMILITY!Â 

Now you see a primary reason why the â€œLeave it to Beaverâ€ days have LEFT. Psychology has come is masquerading as a true science and has become a dictator, demanding to be heard in every arena of life. It replaced the school-teacher, it replaced parents, now it has replaced the Bible-believing pastor! Are you going to sit back and let it happen?:Â 
<blockquote>Acts 5:27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, 28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. 29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.Â </blockquote>
Psychology turns people into victims and erases responsibility and accountability. Instead of calling sin for what it is, it tells rebellious people that they have simply failed to see how â€œworthyâ€ they really are. Insanity!Â 

Now notice again the rest of Paulâ€™s inspired words in 2Tim.3:Â 
<blockquote>2 Timothy 3:13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.Â </blockquote>
Evil men will continue to be deceived by the vain philosophies of man. What then is the obedient Christian to do in such a time as ours? Verse 14 says to continue in the things that you are ASSURED of, knowing where such things have originated.(Vs.14) Every doctrine and idea is supposed to be tested to make sure it has originated in the â€œScripturesâ€. (Not original manuscripts that are no longer here.) Then Paul assures the Christian that the Bible alone is totally able to meet every â€œneedâ€ of man that relates to walking a perfect life before God. What is this but to say that in the last days people will embrace the wisdom of man under the guise of Christianity? They will not take the time to make SURE the original source of the teaching is SCRIPTURE. They will say that man has emotional and â€œpsychologicalâ€ needs that the Bibleâ€™s wisdom cannot provide for. Paul goes on to preach against these lies even more plainly:Â 
<blockquote>2 Timothy 4:1Â I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; 2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.Â </blockquote>
There it is. Accountability must be stressed. Judgment for sin in the lives of believers must be stressed. (There was a time when a large majority of premillennialists understood the Judgment Seat of Christ and accountability for sin, without compromising eternal security. I have personally catalogued close to 100 fiery, well-known, influential premillennialists BEFORE 1960 that understood serious accountability the way Paul taught it. Psychology insured that this teaching was buried. It hurts the delicate â€œself-esteemâ€ of saints to hear about judgment and accountability. Therefore, â€œPapa Psychologyâ€ stood up to defend the fragile, effeminate saints by launching mass propaganda in Bible schools and seminaries against the true Kingdom, responsibility truths: â€œAway with J.R. Graves, away with G.H. Peters, away with I.M. Haldeman, away with R. Govett, away with Pember, away with Panton, Roadhouse, etc.! Away with all the great missionaries who understood responsibility truths and feared God!â€)Â 

Paul goes on to exhort the Christian to preach the WORD. He explains the coming great falling away from truth of which the psychological movement plays such a mammoth part. Yet, Paul assures the Christian that it will not be true â€œscienceâ€ that will deceive so many in the last days. No, it will be â€œfablesâ€:Â 
<blockquote>1 Timothy 6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:Â </blockquote>
The world has entered into just such a state as described in the â€œperilous timesâ€ of 2Tim.3. Nevertheless, the mass failings of psychobabble tend only to make people even more convinced of their need of it! Wake up saints of God. You get crowned for contending and overcoming, not sleeping.Â 

What can you do? Why, you can do what the inspired apostle told Timothy to do. You must preach, reprove, rebuke! Warn. Rip up the foundations. Expose psychology as a â€œscientificâ€ imposter. Every now and then, if you deem it prudent, use the very psychologists themselves against themselves, just like Paul used the Greek philosophers (Acts 17:28). Many counselors got into the psycho-mess out of a sincere desire to help people. Many of the most conscience-stricken have boldly confessed that it is all a game.Â 

Grab a King James Bible and study it. It has blessed the world before. (Study any revival in Americaâ€™s history and see what they were preaching). It has the same power now if you will believe it. It has the truth to save your marriage. It has the truth to fill you with joy. It can give you self-control, peace, maturity, holiness, plus Millennial and eternal life. Yet, you must believe it. You cannot doubt God and flirt with the worldâ€™s depraved wisdom, thinking there is some life-changing â€œnuggetâ€ there for you amidst the psychological dung:Â 
<blockquote>James 1:6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. 8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.Â </blockquote>
<blockquote>Psalms 119:9Â Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.Â </blockquote>
As you study the Holy Scriptures, there are also some books that clearly manifest the error of psychology as a science. They show why it should not be mixed with the Bibleâ€™s truths. Here is a suggested reading list. I suggest going to the authorâ€™s web page on the Net. (Do a search under his or her name). Or, you may find most of these books for sale (i.e. used) on-line at: http://www2.alibris.com/cgi-bin/texis/bookstoreÂ

</ol>
A couple of the above books flirt with psychology as a science to a small degree. Yet, the Christian will see enough in these books to cause him or her to quickly repent of thinking that God left His people without the â€œkeys of mental wellnessâ€ for 1900 years until the Christian churches started â€œdiscoveringâ€ them for the first time in the writings of God-hating Atheists!Â 

If you are a Christian, and you are thinking about psychological counseling for depression, try eating right, getting exercise and perhaps seeing a REAL physician. You might also try to get control of your feelings. The following books offer some good Biblical wisdom in regard to training and controlling your feelings:Â 
<ol>
	<li>â€œSpiritual Depression,â€ D.Martin Lloyd-JonesÂ </li>
	<li>â€œThe Christianâ€™s Secret Of A Happy Life,â€ Hannah Whitall SmithÂ </li>
	<li>â€œRevival Lectures,â€ Charles FinneyÂ </li>
	<li>â€œBroken Things,â€ M.R. DehaanÂ </li>
</ol>
Yet, what the majority of Christians really need is to get free from self-pity. The following books will fix that right up for you:Â 
<ol>
	<li>Biography of Hudson Taylor (You might try â€œHudson Taylorâ€™s Spiritual Secretâ€)Â </li>
	<li>Biography of George Mueller (His autobiography is great)Â </li>
	<li>Biography of Anthony Norris Groves (The 1869, â€œMemoir of Anthony Norris Grovesâ€ by his widow is a â€œtear-jerker,â€ if you can find it.)Â </li>
	<li>Foxeâ€™s Book Of MartyrsÂ </li>
</ol>
Of course, the best thing you can do for yourself, your family, your church and your country is to trust ONLY in the BOOK that closed bars, spread revivals, changed lives, spread liberty and saved souls: the King James Bible. Study it. Learn it. Obey it and begin witnessing and meeting the needs of others. It will help you to win the coming Millennial Kingdom and give you some joy in this brief life at the same time!

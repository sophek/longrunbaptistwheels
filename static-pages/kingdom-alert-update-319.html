OBAMA-SOMA: BIG PHARMA RIDES THE BEAST
(AND DRUGS THE NATION)

"...if anything should go wrong, there's soma...There's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies...you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are...You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears-that's what soma is..."
(Huxley, Brave New World)

"There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it."
(Huxley, at the California Medical School, San Francisco, 1961)

In evaluating the new health care law in America, it is important that we face the grave reality for what it is. This article will expose a few of the worst parts of this plan, and then conclude by showing that our Christian response to any national calamity must be first and foremost confession of sin, repentance, and calling on our God.

The Bible, in Revelation 17, reveals that one day soon the Antichrist, and his totalitarian new world order, will use false, Babylonian religion (headquartered at Rome) to deceive the world. For a time, this false religion will pour out her "wine" and cause the whole world to become intoxicated:

Jeremiah 51:7...the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.

Revelation 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

Revelation 18:23...for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

At this point, in the not-too-distant future, church and state will be merged together to the enslavement of the drunken world. But today, in our own country, the merging of the state and religion (particularly the religion of Humanism) is almost accomplished. Early Humanists, who had control of public education in the 1930's (Dewey, Charles Potter, etc.), proudly asserted that the public school was the New Humanist Church, empowered by the state, and that Christians were powerless to stop the new religion of Humanism (see Humanism: A New Religion, by Charles Potter). They predicted that Humanism would take over Christianity, and that most churches would have to embrace Humanism (with Christian dress) or disappear. Around the same time, Humanists planned to use the field of psychology to give their Humanist religion a "scientific" legitimacy. Men like Fromm, Maslow, etc., argued that psychology must also move into the area of morals and religion in education and speak "authoritatively," further curtailing the influence of the traditional family and church. The result would be a Brave New World (i.e. Hillary's "village") where the "experts" control the sheep by "soma drugs," and if need be, brute force (see H.G. Wells, etc.).

What does all of this have to do with Obama-care (the new health care bill that was passed in America)? In this legislation, we see Big Pharma (like the future Whore and her greedy merchants) riding the Beast (i.e. merging with the state; influencing it; being supported by it, etc.).

And, as with so many other issues of the day, the main dangers of this health care legislation are being ignored in the public debates, media, etc. Notice how this legislation was actually supported (if not spawned) by Big Pharma (i.e. the drug companies):

"When historians write the book on how President Barrack Obama's healthcare overhaul became law, they will need to leave space for some unlikely advocates: lobbyists for the drug, insurance and hospital industries...Drug prescriptions are expected to rise as more people get preventative care and insurance helps them pay for medicine..."
(Fort Worth Star-Telegram, March 23, 2010)

Why be satisfied with millions of Americans buying your drugs? Why not use the law to force people to get insurance so that everyone can now purchase drugs! This is why millions of dollars was spent by Big Pharma on TV ads in a last minute push to get this legislation passed:

"Hospitals, doctors, drug makers and most health insurers will pick up armies of new paying customers..."
(Kaiserhealthnews.org)

"Pharma is one of the big winners."
(Nancy Chockley, president of the National Institute for Health Care Management)

"...we remain completely committed to helping the President and Congress pass comprehensive health care reform this year. We continue to be guided by a single-minded purpose: everyone in America - not just some of us, but all of us - should have access to high-quality, affordable health care coverage and services..."
(Ken Johnson, Senior Vice President, PhRMA - Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America)

How nice of them. They want "no American left behind" when it comes to purchasing their drugs - even if they have to use the state to enforce it. In 2009 (Aug. 8), the New York Times reported:

"The drug industry has authorized its lobbyists to spend as much as $150 million on television commercials supporting President Obama's health care overhaul...The terms of the deal [between Obama and Big Pharma] were not fully disclosed...By comparison, President Obamaâ€™s presidential campaign spent about $236 million on television commercials while the campaign of the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona, spent about $126 million. Few expect the opponents of the health care overhaul to muster as much advertising muscle as its backers...The drug makers stand to gain millions of new customers from the expansion of health care coverage...The drug industry has already contributed millions of dollars to advertising campaigns for the health care overhaul through the advocacy groups like Healthy Economies Now and Families USA..."

With all of this expensive propaganda (going on for years), many Americans now think this is all very wonderful. They have not read Gary Null's informative, explosive book, Prescription For Disaster, or G. Edward Griffin's, World Without Cancer. Although all would agree that the present medical system does some good, most Americans are blinded to the vast destruction that the current system generates. This system cannot be truly remedied by more control (as Obama, and others believe). The answer to the problem is less control by the government (the FDA, AMA, etc.)! Most people are unaware of the differences between naturopathic and allopathic medicine. They are unaware of all of the whole-plant, natural alternatives that heal the body without dangerous side-effects (and millions of dollars lining the pockets of drug companies). Jesus teaches that a man lives, in part, by what he eats. Yet, most are unaware of the fact that most doctors are denied an education in basic nutrition. Most do not realize how many symptoms that are treated by more drugs, are caused by drugs themselves, and could be healed by stopping drugs, or by proper nutrition, supplements, etc.

This is another reason why there is such a push to control this natural health industry (as in a recent McCain bill). And if people must purchase health insurance, how much control will insurance companies allow people concerning their own health? Will vaccinations and certain drugs be mandated, as many have warned?

Many people are largely unaware that doctors are victims of constant solicitation by drug company salesmen, and that most of their information about various drugs comes from the drug company promotional material. And who really "talks" to a doctor about anything today, anyway? The patient must open his mouth and say "soma." The whole system is designed to intimidate the patient into taking the latest drugs. The multitudes of doctors (and insiders) who do expose the deception and tyranny (and many have), become immediate victims of one of the most powerful propaganda machines the world has ever seen (e.g. overnight, the most accredited physicians are branded as quacks, etc., for daring to speak out).

But none of this (as ominous and serious as it all is) focuses on the biggest problems in this new legislation. It is one thing to bury information about natural-health cures, leaving people to the destructive side-effects of poisons peddled by pharmaceutical pushers. But so-called mental health is the most dangerous arena. In this field, thousands of new "disorders" can be invented with new drugs prescribed for "treatment." For example, in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, more disorders are invented for drug companies to "treat":

"Children who throw too many tantrums could be diagnosed with 'temper dysregulation with dysphoria.' Teenagers who are particularly eccentric might be candidates for treatment for 'psychosis risk syndrome'...

These are among dozens of proposals being unveiled today by the American Psychiatric Association in the first complete revision since 1994 of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or 'DSM' - the massive tome that has served as the bible for modern psychiatry for more than half a century."
(Washington Post, Feb. 10. 2010)

Often, with the current system, a patient is suddenly "cured" (for all practical purposes) when his insurance runs out! But with Obama-Care, the insurance never runs out! There is therefore now no end to the money that can be made in the area of "mental health." The recent statistics of adults and children on various psychological/anti-depressant drugs is frightening. In 2007, according to federal data, nearly 7 million Americans "abused" prescription drugs (pain-killers, etc.). Between 2002 and 2005, prescriptions for antidepressants soared from 154 million to 170 million. In recent years, the increase has continued unabated:

"More than 164 million prescriptions were written in 2008 for antidepressants, totaling $9.6 billion in U.S. sales, according to IMS Health...The rise in antidepressant prescriptions also is seen despite a series of public health warnings on use of antidepressant drugs beginning in 2003 after clinical trials showed they increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and teens."
(Reuters, Aug. 3, 2009).

Now, with Obama-Care, everyone will have insurance, and therefore, these numbers will explode to an even greater degree. An article in the New York Times (Dec. 11, 2009), by Duff Wilson, reports:

"Poor Children Likelier to Get Antipsychotics - New federally financed drug research reveals a stark disparity: children covered by Medicaid are given powerful antipsychotic medicines at a rate four times higher than children whose parents have private insurance. And the Medicaid children are more likely to receive the drugs for less severe conditions than their middle-class counterparts, the data shows."

At the present time, 3-month old babies are often placed on anti-psychotic medicines, etc. Most of the children in foster care are drugged. Welcome to the land of Obama-Soma, where it will be a "disorder" to not have a disorder - you must be "treated" for your mental imbalances - everyone who is "normal" must have a disorder for which they are being treated by Big Brother's Big Pharma.

And this brings us to the most alarming aspect of the new "health care." They are not even satisfied in having everyone insured (with a seemingly endless supply of money to buy mental health drugs):

Proverbs 27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

The new legislation also comes with "mental health screening" in various programs. This means that millions of Americans will be "evaluated" to make sure they are taking their soma (at work, school, home, etc.). While screening is not new, there will now be an abundant degree of federal funding to increase it (thanks to tax payers and a newly enlarged IRS).

In 2003, Big Pharma issued, The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health as a "recommendation" to the President. It outlined programs for screening all Americans for "disorders." They wanted "mental health parity," which would grant equal insurance coverage for physical and mental disorders. Those who are quick to trust the Republicans to remedy Obama's health plan should remember that former President Bush commissioned the above report (and also gave the country the Patriot Act). Obama is now giving this mental-screening beast its teeth and energizing it. Beverly K. Eakman (a former federal employee who served as speechwriter for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, and as editor-in-chief of NASA's newspaper at the Johnson Space Center) warns:

"Most people (including Members of Congress and the press) won't read the nearly 2,000-page healthcare bill ('Affordable Health Care for America Act': H.R. 3962)...[It] will serve to prop up an already misrepresented collection of disorders and channel ever-more-billions into the psycho-pharmaceutical industry...With legal legitimacy for unprovable mental disorders will come, inevitably, an excuse to marginalize individuals on the basis of conscience, outspokenness, and politics...Let's take the company Screening for Mental Health, Inc., and its sub-organization, 'Signs of Suicide.' Both promote and conduct mental-health screening. The umbrella organization received $4,985,925 from pharmaceutical companies prior to 2008, and 10 of its psychiatric researchers have been exposed in just the past year for failing to disclose millions of dollars in pharmaceutical payments...[Then there is] Mental-health Parity (Section 214, Page 100). This idea has been floated before. It guarantees equal insurance coverage for mental disorders and physical diseases...Considering there are no medical tests to verify the existence of any psychiatric disorder (blood work, urinalysis, X-ray, etc.), meaning that government has nothing other than a psychiatrist's opinion that the person is 'cured,' parity becomes a taxpayer-funded cash-cow..."
(The Healthcare Bill's Sops to the Mental-health Industry, November 5, 2009)

Along this line are the School-based Health Clinics, which screen children (i.e. "mental health assessments" as worded in the bill) and result in even more children being placed on subjective, dangerous "mental health" drugs. With the new health-care law, schools will be increasingly funded to become an even greater force in - not only the propaganda of Humanism - but actually enforcing "mental health" by administering brain drugs. Notice the gleeful response of one organization that has worked to increase and promote these new health clinics:

"With President Obama signing the federal health care reform bill, school health centers have won a major victory because the bill includes two important provisions for school-based health centers (SBHCs): language authorizing a federal SBHC grant program that would provide $50 million over five years; and an emergency appropriation that would provide $200 million for SBHCs over two years...School health centers are usually located directly on a school campus and provide primary care like any health clinic. Staff vary in size, and typically includes nurse practitioners, nurses, mental health providers, as well as part-time physicians and medical students. Services may include: primary care, mental health, health education, and/or dental care, all at no or low cost."

Another dangerous addition to the new health care plan is the "Quality Home Visitation Program." States will receive ongoing federal funds to expand their home-visitation programs. Such programs always begin on a so-called voluntary basis, but soon end up being enforced upon the daily lives of Americans. In Hillary Clinton's vision of the ideal "village" (It Takes a Village), all parenting is monitored by government "experts." Obama's plan funds this village. States that receive federal grants are "encouraged" to provide home visitation to as many families as possible. Many believe this will end up in states pressuring families to submit to this visitation. Anyone who refuses these programs will be suspect. Do they have something to hide? We can be practically certain that the federally funded "experts" who visit the homes will be quick to "recommend" drugs for behavioral problems, etc. Parents that resist will run a great risk of being declared a "bad parent" that is not interested in the "welfare" of the child according to qualified "experts." An organization (NHSA) that endorses these visitation programs rejoices at the passing of Obama's plan:

"The House last night voted 219-212 to adopt Senate-passed health care reform legislation, paving the way for an overhaul of the nation's health care system...The bill, headed immediately to the President's desk, includes many provisions that are important for Healthy Start coalitions, including: ...Home Visitation - Provides $1.5 billion over 5 years...for states to provide evidence-based maternal, infant and early childhood home visitation programs. Grantees are required to measure improvement in maternal and child health, childhood injury prevention, school readiness and achievement, crime or domestic violence, family economic self-sufficiency and coordination with community resources. States will be required to complete a needs assessment to identify communities that have few quality home visitation program and are at risk for poor maternal and child health outcomes..."

Time and space would fail at this time to explore the "Federally Qualified Behavioral Health Centers," and the "24-hour mobile crisis teams," and all of the other ways the state, drug merchants, and the religion of psychology/psychiatry/Humanism have linked together to drug the nation. In the face of this national madness, it is important to seek the sound mind that the Holy Spirit gives to us, and calls us to keep (2 Timothy 1:7, Ephesians 5:17). As Christians, what should be our response to the events and tribulations of these perilous times? The Scriptures will give us some important guidance. Please examine them carefully, and seek how we may apply them to our situation today:

John 16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

Luke 21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

Daniel 3:17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.
18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

Colossians 3:2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

Psalms 25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him...

Psalms 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.

Isaiah 8:19 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?

Daniel 9:5 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
14 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

Judges 3:7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia...
9 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer...

Judges 10:10 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
11 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel...
14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
15 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
16 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

As we see from these Scriptures, it is not stiff, lifeless prayer that will bring deliverance; it is fervent, pressing, crying out to God in repentance. It is not looking far and wide for an earthly deliverer, it is looking carefully at how we have offended God, by tolerating the high places, the groves, etc. If we cannot make an application to our own sins in this generation, may the Lord help us. Let us repent of replacing God's truths and ways with psychological, worldly spirituality. God's secret will be with those who fear Him. Go ahead. Continue to deny His warnings. Continue to explain them away. Obama agrees with you. He has great plans for you and your children.

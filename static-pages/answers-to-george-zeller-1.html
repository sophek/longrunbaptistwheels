My response to his objections will follow at the end of his article.

The Punitive View of J.D. Faust, By George Zeller :

"J.D. Faust published a book in 2002 entitled The Rod--Will God Spare It? It is published by Schoettle Publishing Company, the same company that published Joseph Dillow's book, The Reign of the Servant Kings. It is a publishing house which specializes in authors (such as Govett, Lang, Panton, Pember, etc.) who teach that unfaithful saved people will be excluded from the kingdom (or in Dillow's case, excluded from reigning with Christ). Many of these men also believe in a partial rapture (not Dillow).

Hodges, Dillow and Wilkin share much in common with Faust. They all hold to the same theological framework in that they divide all saved people into two distinct groups: those who are overcomers and those who are not; those who inherit the kingdom and those who do not, those who are partakers of Christ and those who are not, those who will reign with Christ and those who will not, etc. But Hodges, Dillow and Wilkin strongly reject Faust's extreme views on millennial punishment, and for good reasons.

Faust teaches that unfaithful Christians will be hurt of the second death (Rev. 2:11) and then will be cast into Hades where they will suffer for a thousand years. He believes in degrees of suffering--some saved people will only suffer "few stripes" and other very wicked saved people will suffer "many stripes." Faust defines outer darkness as follows:

OUTER DARKNESS: This is the same as the underworld or hell. To be cast out of heaven is to be cast down to earth (Rev. 12:7-10). Therefore, to be cast out of God's kingdom on earth is to be cast down into the underworld (Matthew 5:30, 18:9, Mark 9:47). Unfaithful Christians will be temporarily banished to the underworld until after the millennium. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in this outer darkness (Matthew 8:12, 22:13, 25:30). The unfaithful Christian goes to the same place as the unbeliever and hypocrite until after the millennium (p. 408).

Faust is correct in his understanding that "weeping and gnashing of teeth" involves severe punishment. Faust also insists that the ones described by this expression are totally excluded from Christ's kingdom. In this he is correct also (Hodges and Dillow teach that they are in the kingdom as citizens but they do not inherit the kingdom as joint-heirs, a position which Faust shows to be fraught with problems). Faust is correct in saying that those cast into outer darkness are not in the kingdom at all!

Faust's great error is that he believes that those who are cast into outer darkness will include members of Christ's beloved body. Paul told the Corinthians (yes, even the carnal Corinthians), that "when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord [in this life], that we should not be condemned with the world [in the next life]--1 Corinthians 11:32. Faust teaches that members of the body of Christ are condemned with the world and have their portion with unbelievers and hypocrites for 1000 years in the fires of Hades! God's loving rod, which He does not spare, is for His beloved children in this life (Hebrews 12:5-11). It is a matter of loving discipline, not punitive punishment.

To require that Christians be punished for their sins is a wicked insult to the perfect finished work of Christ on the cross. We must never doubt the sufficiency and the adequacy of the cross-work of Christ and the Father's total satisfaction of that work. And if we were to be punished for our sins, even for the least of our sins, 1000 years would never be sufficient to satisfy the justice of God. It would require the lake of fire forever.

Note: Faust would probably deny that saved people in Hades are being punished for their sins, but if you study his book it is hard to deny this. He has saved people experiencing "condemnation," the "wrath of God," "perdition," "Hell," "Outer Darkness," "the Lake of Fire," the "second Death," etc, etc. Anything and everything that applies to unbelievers he applies to believers -- just not for all eternity. His reasoning is that if the torment is anything short of being everlasting -- whether it be for 1,000 years or 1,000,000 years -- then it is discipline and not any sort of payment or partial payment for sins. On page 42 he even says that Christians will experience "punitive judgments" and will experience "severe punitive consequences." The only difference he makes between the unsaved and the unfaithful Christians, is that the punishment of the unsaved is eternal and the punishment of the saved is temporary. But it is "punitive" as Faust admits."

JOEY FAUST RESPONDS:

Brother Zeller writes:

"But Hodges, Dillow and Wilkin strongly reject Faust's extreme views on millennial punishment, and for good reasons."

Zeller personally embraces the "extreme view" that an unfaithful Christian will experience NO chastisement or pain on the day reckoning. This is in contrast to the "extreme view" on the other side, which claims that it is possible for true Christians to be punished with eternal torment (losing eternal salvation). In light of these two "extremes," the doctrine that unfaithful Christians (who do not repent in time) will be chastised at the Judgment Seat of Christ and banished during the Millennium, represents the MODERATE VIEW. It is able to combine the partial truth on both sides of the controversy.

But let us get to the heart of Zeller's objection. Zeller writes:

"Faust's great error is that he believes that those who are cast into outer darkness will include members of Christ's beloved body. Paul told the Corinthians (yes, even the carnal Corinthians), that 'when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord [in this life], that we should not be condemned with the world [in the next life]--1 Corinthians 11:32.'"

Zeller uses the phrase "beloved body," as if any rational man should realize that Jesus would never temporarily send part of "His Body" into outer darkness. Let us, for the moment, set aside the historic, Baptist debates concerning exactly what Christ's Body consists of (i.e. local or universal; all saints, or some saints, etc.). Let's assume Zeller's view for the sake of argument: Christ's Body consists of every true Christian around the world. What then? Jesus teaches that body parts which "offend" should be removed (Mark 9:43). One replies: "But this is a picture." Assuming this to be true, is not the very example that Zeller is citing (i.e. the Lord's Body) also a picture? In the parable of the Vine, our Lord Jesus clearly teaches that some branches may be CUT OFF from the Vine:

John 15:2 Every branch IN ME that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

Therefore, Zeller is interpreting Scripture on the basis of a preconceived assumption. He assumes that no member of Christ's Body may spend 1000 years in outer darkness. Yet, Jesus teaches plainly that body parts, at times, should be cut off; and with the analogy of the Vine, we see that Zeller's assumption is in direct contrast to the words of our Lord. Paul also refutes Zeller's assumption. He writes:

1 Corinthians 5:13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

1 Corinthians 12:25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.

Plainly, members of a body can be cut off from the assembly. Therefore, where is the evidence that a member of Christ's "universal body" cannot be temporarily cast into outer darkness on the day of reckoning? On the day of the Judgment Seat of Christ, there is no debate that every Christian will then be present in ONE BODY, or assembly. What is the evidence that on that day of INSPECTION, that our Lord cannot, and will not, temporarily banish some branches or members? There is no evidence. Our Lord teaches that He will certainly banish the unfaithful servants on the day of reckoning (Matthew 25:30).

Zeller quotes 1 Corinthians 11:32 as his proof text:

1 Corinthians 11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

Zeller misses the point. Paul is teaching that the Lord chastises us in THIS life, so we will not have to experience chastisement in outer darkness (with the world) at the Lord's coming:

Luke 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion WITH THE UNBELIEVERS.

Zeller does not tell us how the chastisement of a born again believer keeps them from being condemned. In what way does it do so? Are not believers already saved in eternity? What would suffering chastisement have to do with eternal salvation?

No, eternal salvation is not the issue. The question is whether or not believers will be judged NOW, in this life, or whether they will be temporarily judged at the Lord's coming. The Lord's chastisements in this life are meant to move us to quickly JUDGE OURSELVES and repent. It will be too late at the Judgment Seat:

1 Corinthians 5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit MAY be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

However, whether or not this earthly chastisement is effectual depends upon how we RESPOND to it. The Bible teaches that Christians may respond to chastisement in two sinful ways; both of which will hinder its effectiveness:

Hebrews 12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, DESPISE NOT thou the chastening of the Lord, NOR FAINT when thou art rebuked of him:

Therefore, God chastises Christians in this life, not so that we may be saved in eternity (a gift already possessed), but that we may be saved into the Millennial Kingdom on the day of the Judgment Seat of Christ. If we respond to the Lord's chastisements by ignoring them (refusing to search out the cause and repent), or by surrendering to self-pity or sinful discouragement (getting angry at God), we will meet with greater chastisement at the Judgment Seat of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:9-11):

Revelation 2:16 REPENT; OR ELSE I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches...

Next, Zeller writes:

"God's loving rod, which He does not spare, is for His beloved children in this life (Hebrews 12:5-11). It is a matter of loving discipline, not punitive punishment."

Where does the Bible say that the Lord's loving rod is ONLY administered in this life? There is no such statement. The Bible refers to this age as the time of the Lord's patience and longsuffering. It is not YET the day of JUDGMENT or RECKONING:

Matthew 25:19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and RECKONETH with them.

1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that JUDGMENT must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

Zeller uses the fact that believers suffer chastisements in this life as an argument that they will not suffer them at the Judgment Seat. But on what basis? By the same reasoning we could conclude that UNBELIEVERS will not suffer at the Lord's coming, or after death. They also suffer JUDGMENTS in this life (Acts 12:23, Proverbs 13:15, etc.). But judgments in this life serve as warnings or restraints. They do not in any way negate future recompense of believers, or unbelievers.

And what if we tested Zeller's logic with happy rewards? Does God reward us for faithfulness in this life? Certainly He does (Luke 18:30). But would Zeller argue that since believers are rewarded in this life, God cannot reward them further at the Judgment Seat? What do we say of a system of theology that allows God the right to reward faithfulness in this life and at His coming, but does not give God the right to reward UNFAITHFULNESS in the same manner?

Zeller writes:

"It is a matter of loving discipline, not punitive punishment."

Zeller has created a box with a lid (perhaps from tradition or his own emotions) in which confines his idea of "loving discipline." And what a strange box it is! God can give certain unfaithful saints cancer, and even kill others, in THIS LIFE, and this is called "loving discipline." But if God administers any kind of true PAIN at the Judgment Seat, this is called "punitive punishment," and is forbidden. But this box was not created by Scripture. The Bible, in many places, teaches that some Christians may experience SEVERE PAIN at the Judgment Seat. Man responds with every type of twist and turn that can be imagined to duck these Scriptures. The Bible is then read through the lens of the PRECONCEIVED ASSUMPTION that no Christian may be chastised ON THE DAY OF RECKONING in the SAME MANNER as many are chastised in this day of God's patience. Thus, Zeller believes God does not "spare the rod" as long as He is away. But on the day of reckoning, when He returns, Zeller believes He must "spare the rod" and cannot inflict any pain.

Zeller writes:

"To require that Christians be punished for their sins is a wicked insult to the perfect finished work of Christ on the cross. We must never doubt the sufficiency and the adequacy of the cross-work of Christ and the Father's total satisfaction of that work. And if we were to be punished for our sins, even for the least of our sins, 1000 years would never be sufficient to satisfy the justice of God."

This is a subtle straw man which plays with words. In the English dictionary and the English Bible (and Zeller is speaking English), words such as "punish" and "chasten" are at times used interchangeably:

-Chasten: "1. To inflict disciplinary or corrective PUNISHMENT on. 2. To punish, chastise..." (Oxford)

-Punish: "1...to subject to judicial CHASTISEMENT as retribution or requital, or as a caution....3. To inflict heavy damage, injury, or LOSS on." (Oxford)

-Chasten: "1. To correct by PUNISHING; to PUNISH; to inflict pain by stripes, or in other manner, for the purpose of punishing..." (Webster's 1828)

-Punish: "2.. To chastise; as a father PUNISHES his child for disobedience."

I am using such words according to their above definitions. The English Bible uses these words (chastise and punish) in the same manner (2 Corinthians 2:6, Hebrews 10:29, Amos 2:6, Ezekiel 14:10, 1 Kings 12:14, Lamentations 4:22; compare Leviticus 26:18 with 26:28).

God has indeed removed (on the basis of the Cross) the eternal penalty of every future sin of every believer. Yet, God still reserves the right to correct, warn, and temporarily render according to works (good and bad) in regard to believers. Therefore, WHATEVER Zeller wishes to call it when a disobedient believer is made sick or is slain by God, the SAME TYPE OF PAIN may be experienced by believers on the day of reckoning. And if it is a "wicked insult" to say God inflicts temporary pain at the Judgment Seat, it is, by the same logic, a wicked insult to claim that He ever inflicts pain upon believers in this life. Zeller's logic is that the PHYSICAL PRESENCE of the Lord decides whether or not He may inflict pain on His unfaithful children. But this is a distinction often rooted in modern tradition and/or emotional imagination. It is not rooted in Scripture:

Matthew 24:50 The lord of that servant SHALL COME in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

THE CONSEQUENCES AND POSSIBLE SIGNS OF SELF-POLLUTION         

In this study, I will be addressing a very important subject - especially for teens in these perilous times. There are two mistakes that are made today in reference to this type of subject matter. On one side, we have many Christian writers or speakers who appear to be proud of their "openness" to use frank, or even lewd, language and subject matter in front of mixed groups (young and old, male and female). Many mega-churches have jumped on the new "risque" bandwagon, where they parade their openness as a virtue before the world. On the other side, are many pastors and teachers who never confront the real sins of the age; and they do not realize that as long as Christians drink from the sewers of this world's amusements, their manners will be likewise corrupted. They continue to "play church" as the people (especially the youth) race to destruction.

Therefore, in this study, there is some plain preaching that older youth need to hear. Yet, the language is clean. The Authorized Version is plain and sharp, yet pure and guarded in its language. Preachers can use its language to thunder against sin, exhort to holiness in areas of purity, and yet maintain proper manners in mixed company.

With this introduction, let us begin:

1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators...adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

Certainly, we see in this verse a condemnation of cross-dressing and sodomy. Webster, following proper decorum (it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret) simply defines sodomy as "a crime against nature." Certainly, what has historically been called "self-pollution" or "self-abuse" is a crime against nature! Notice another Scripture:

Proverbs 14:9 Fools make a mock at sin...

In other words, fools will joke about various sins as if they are trifling, and of no consequence. This will especially be the situation in the final days before the return of Christ:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves...
3 Without natural affection...
13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

Perhaps "lovers of their own selves" not only condemns the psychological, self-help movement, but also warns that sodomy and self-pollution will be rampant in the last days. Notice that their affection will not be natural (v. 3).

Other Scriptures warn us that fornication will be widespread when the Lord begins to judge the earth:

Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their...fornication...

In the Bible, the words fornication and adultery have general, as well as specific meanings. These words also condemn the sin known as self-pollution!:

Adultery: "In a scriptural sense, all manner of lewdness or unchastity, as in the seventh commandment." (Webster, 1828)

"Fornication is generally understood to consist in...intercourse between two unmarried persons; but it is used by Christ in a sense synonymous with adultery, when He says: 'Whosoever putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.' (Matt. 5:32.) And it is used by the apostle for the sin of incest, when he says: 'It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.' (1 Cor. 5:1.) All these, and self-pollution, sodomy, bestiality, and every other species of uncleanness, are forbidden by this commandment; and the punishments prescribed for those acts by the inspired writers were death in some violent form, among which are mentioned stoning, and to be burned with fire. (Lev. 20:11-21.) These heavy punishments exhibit God's displeasure against this sin in all its developments, and the necessity of chastity in all the human race."
(John Locke, A System of Theology, 1866)

Therefore, the sin of self-pollution (also sometimes called self-abuse, Onanism, etc.) is condemned by the words fornication and adultery when they are used in a general sense. This sin is also certainly condemned by the Biblical words uncleanness, filthiness, etc:

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

Colossians 3:5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence...
6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:

God has not left any room for self-pollution. He has condemned all uncleaness with multiple words and phrases:

Ephesians 5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

Romans 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly,

The Holy Spirit also adds the words "and such like" to His list of sins, so that jesting fools are without excuse in their attempts to justify self-pollution:

Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

With this general, Biblical introduction, let us take a specific look at the Scriptures.

The Uncleanness of Voluntary Emission:

Leviticus 15:16 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

If a man is unclean for an involuntary, nocturnal emission, how unclean does God consider one who purposely spills his seed in self-abuse?:

"Go out from him...in his sleep, which is called nightly pollution, which, though involuntary, might arise from some lustful dream or imagination. But if it was voluntary, and by a man's own procurement when awake, it was esteemed abominable..."
(Matthew Poole, d. 1679)

It is obvious that it is indeed an abomination. If cross-dressing is also an abomination (Deut. 22:5), how much more is the sin of self-pollution?

But in this day and age, where billboards and magazine racs in check-out lines bombard young people (assuming they are separated from TV, Internet, etc.), one would think that Christian leaders would give a certain sound with the trumpet. Instead, the opposite is the case. Most are casual and vague about it. Others, who name the name of Christ, actually endorse the sin!

The Perilous-Apostasy View of Self-Abuse:

As a frightening sign of the times, multitudes of modern authors, preachers, counselors, etc. (worldly or "Christian"), downplay self-abuse. Dr. James Dobson's view is that self-abuse is normal, and should simply be ignored by parents, and that is has nothing to do with one's relationship or fellowship with God (search at www.focusonthefamily.com)! He is also the same "counselor" that suggests that fathers should shower with their older boys. From such turn away. The Scriptures in 2 Peter 2 (and Jude) are being fulfilled before our eyes:

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness...
14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls...
19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.

They have simply redefined the Biblical language so that outright sin is no longer exposed and reproved. Dobson's arguments for self-abuse are that everyone is doing it, and that it is too difficult to resist, and that unscientific claims were made about it, etc. Yet, such objections would justify all forms of fornication (or any sin) if they were reasonable! Dr. Dobson is simply comforming to the decaying culture instead of confronting it. Dr. Mendelsohn (Confessions of a Medical Heretic) does a better job!:

"Thanks to Modern Medicine's sanction, what were once called sins are no longer sins at all. Thus, homosexuality is now called an 'alternative lifestyle'...In my lifetime, I've seen society's attitudes toward [self-pollution], for example, go through three distinct phases. When I was young [it] was sinful and dangerous. [It made you blind, etc.] Scientists didn't even try to determine whether or not this was true. Later, when I was in college [it] was neutral...Now, however, we're in the third phase...[It is considered] normal, healthy..."

Indeed, the reader will be amazed to see the following documentation that shows that almost all of mankind in history has thundered against this sin as one of the vilest known among man. It is only in this "enlightened" age that abominations provoke laughter - even among so-called conservative preachers and teachers.

The Historic View:

"The sin itself, which is here particularly described by the Holy Ghost, that men might be instructed concerning the nature and the great evil of this sin of self-pollution...which is condemned not only by Scripture, but even by the light of nature, and the judgment of heathens, who have expressly censured it as a great sin...Whereby we may sufficiently understand how wicked and abominable a practice this is amongst Christians, and in the light of the gospel, which lays greater and stricter obligations upon us to purity, and severely forbids all pollution both of flesh and spirit."
(Matthew Poole, d. 1679)

"...the crime in it self is monstrous and unnatural; in its practice filthy and odious to extremity; its
guilt is crying, and its consequences ruinous..."
(Onania; or the Heinous Sin of Self-Pollution, 1707-1717)

"[Onanism is the] crime of self-pollution...This practice...hath among all nations been reckoned a very great crime...In Scripture...we find self-polluters termed effeminate, unclean, filthy, and abominable. Even the heathens, who had not the advantage of revelation, were of the same opinion, as appears from the following lines of Martial:

'You think 'tis nothing! 'tis a crime, believe!
A crime so great, you scarcely could conceive.'
(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1823)

 

" [It is] one of the most destructive evils ever practiced by fallen man."
 (Adam Clarke)

"While sexual sin is the most destructive of all human vices, this personal form is by far its worst, because it is the greatest outrage...Sodomy is another exercise of this passion, if possible, still worse..."
(Orson Squire Fowler, 1870)

"As a sin against nature, it has no parallel except in sodomy (see Gen. 19: 5, Judges 19:22)...Even though no warning may have been given, the transgressor seems to know, instinctively, that he is committing a great wrong..."
(John Harvey Kellogg, Plain Facts for Old and Young, 1872)

"...this shameful and criminal act is the most frequent, as well as the most fatal, of all vices..."
(Nicholas Francis Cooke, M.D., Satan in Society: A Plea for Social Purity, 1873)

"This evil is also termed...Self-Abuse, Onanism, Self-Pollution...Voluntary Pollution, etc...Solitary indulgence is a deplorable...evil..."
(R.V. Pierce, Common Sense Medical Advisor, 1874)

"...Onanism is...far beyond all comparison the very worst form of [lustful] indulgence...Its sin consists in turning into a base, unmanly, and contemptible gratification, that which is designed...for a Divine end; and...by fraud...dissevering the end from the means...this term [Onanism] is altogether a misnomer...[for] the filthy practice of self- pollution...The gist of [Onan's] crime was his refusal to raise up seed to his deceased brother, according to the requirement of the Divine Law, 'wherefore the Lord slew him'...[His name should not be used to designate] the far more obscene, grossly sensual, debasing, destructive, and most unnatural act of self-pollution..."
(D.F. Bright, M.D., Medical Brief: A Monthly Journal of Scientific Medicine, 1898)

 

The Signs of Self-Pollution: Downcast, Effeminate, Shunning, Nervous, etc.:  

 The greater the sin, the more shame (or self-consciousness) it brings to the sinner:

Genesis 3:8...Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God...

Genesis 4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?...

Proverbs 28:1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.

Teen boys need manly fathers and preachers to sound the alarm, so they may grow up in manliness and bold purity. But nervousness and self-consciousness is often a sign of secret immorality. This has been understood from the most ancient times, in diverse cultures:

"Young people [who practice self-abuse, etc.] become pale, effeminate, indisposed to physical exertion, stupid and even imbecile..."
(Aretaeus, an ancient Greek physician)

Certainly, it is not an absolute sign. The teen years can be awkward, without secret sins. Even so, parents need to know that it is a possible sign, and teens need to know that their boldness in life (and in prayer before God, etc.)  depends upon their purity as Christians:

"This one vice, above all others, affects the brain, head, nerves..."
(Of the crime of Onan, or the heinous vice of self-defilement, 1720)

"...All the intellectual faculties are weakened...They are continually under a kind of inward restlessness...pimples on the face...[are] one of the most common symptoms...the soul itself becomes polluted..."
(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1823)

Most of these older preachers and doctors made it clear that acne was not an absolute sign of this sin. But when it is joined together with many other signs, parents should be watchful and at least concerned. What is interesting is that modern science - while it laughs in pride at the old beliefs - often ends up proving them! For example, they recently found out that "snake oil" is good for you (though I would suggest substituting fish oil for snakes to get the same benefit!). And they have now found a link between acne and stress. Therefore, at least for some teens, stress could be caused by their guilty conscience, and this may at least increase their skin problems:

"Scientists find stress linked to acne...Was the outbreak caused by stress? Until now, no scientific evidence has supported that it is. But German researchers say they have found a major indication that stress and acne, as well as other skin conditions, are linked. 'At the beginning we thought this was a crazy hypothesis, that something connected to the central nervous system could have anything to do with the skin,' said Christos Zouboulis, a professor at the Free University in Berlin. Acne forms when oily secretions from the sebaceous glands beneath the skin plug up the pores. But what causes the oil to form in the first place? The German researchers found that a stress hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is released in the sebaceous gland - producing oily skin, which sets the stage for acne...Dr. Jerome Litt, a dermatologist who's been in practice for more than 50 years and wrote the book 'Your Skin From A to Z', says he firmly believes stress aggravates acne."
(http://archives.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/05/14/acne.stress/)

Yet, it should be mentioned that acne may be present without sin or stress, guilt, etc. But, as Dr. Kellogg (of corn flakes' fame) teaches below, when there are multiple signs, parents should be at least concerned:

"If a boy who has previously been cheerful, pleasant, dutiful...suddenly becomes...cross, peevish, irritable, and disobedient, be sure that some foul influence is at work with him...A healthy child will be active, playful, full of life and animal spirits. If a young child manifests indisposition to activity, a dislike for play, lifelessness and languor, suspect his habits, if there is no other reasonable cause to which to attribute his unnatural want of childish sprightliness...When a child who has previously learned readily, mastered his lessons easily, and possessed a retentive memory, shows a manifest decline in these directions, fails to get his lessons, becomes stupid, forgetful, and inattentive, he has probably become the victim of a terrible vice...This vice has a wonderful influence in developing untruthfulness. A child previously honest, under its baneful influence will soon become an inveterate liar...Love of solitude is a very suspicious sign...Bashfulness is not infrequently dependent upon this cause. It would be far from right to say that every person who is excessively modest or timid is a [self-abuser]; but there is a certain timorousness which seems to arise from a sense of shame or fear of discovery that many victims of this vice exhibit...One very common mode of manifestation of this timidity is the inability to look a superior, or any person who is esteemed pure, in the eye. If spoken to, instead of looking directly at the person to whom he addresses an answer, the [self-abuser] looks to one side, or lets his eyes fall upon the ground, seemingly conscious that the eye is a wonderful tell-tale of the secrets of the mind...the vice greatly exaggerates natural fear...He may be superficially quick and cute, but is incapable of deep thought...Attempts at joking are generally failures, as the jest is sure to be inappropriate or vulgar...Round shoulders and a stooping posture in sitting are characteristics of young [self-abusers]...Whenever a child seats himself, the head and shoulders droop forward...in walking rapidly [they]...walk as if they had been stiffened in the hips...[Pimples are not an absolute sign, but a possible marker]...Biting the finger nails is a practice very common [among self-abusers]....Unchastity of speech and fondness for obscene stories [are a sign]...no single one of the above signs should be considered as conclusive evidence of the habit in any individual; but any one of them may, and should, arouse suspicion and watchfulness..."
(John Harvey Kellogg, Plain Facts for Old and Young, 1872)

"[In self-abuse,] injury is done to the nervous system...[the practice is] attended by an observable loss of nervous power...The indications of this vice in...boys, are irritability, impatience and restlessness...they become pale, sunken-eyed, timid and downcast in look...the intellect becomes enfeebled. They are depressed in spirits, easily discouraged and prefer solitude...the short, irritable replies of the boy to his mother...is indicative of the loss of nervous power occasioned by this habit...solitary gratification [self-pollution] never awakens joy or gladness...it only sinks the individual in selfish, sensual experience. It tends to make...gloomy and unhappy, and estranges [causes people to withdraw]...[it] castes the mind into melancholic desperation...reserved, timid, distant, suspicious [no boldness]...When it gets control of a person, it is though an unclean spirit has entered...It swallows up every other interest...The indications of [self] abuse are loss of nervous energy, dullness of the mental faculties and delight in obscene stories...movements [become] slow...the disposition is fretful and irritable...[the boy may make frequent, nervous attempts to clear his throat,]...the [desire] for play or labor is gone, and there is a growing distaste for business...the eye is without sparkle...there is carelessness in the personal appearance, and a lawlessness [rebellion] with regard to...neatness...[He] desires to be alone..."
(R.V. Pierce, Common Sense Medical Advisor, 1874)

"Lallemand thus describes a person who had continually practiced this vice. 'His...complexion pale...He is apathetic...he falters in his walk, appearing afraid to step; he is...nervous..."
(D.F. Bright, M.D., Medical Brief: A Monthly Journal of Scientific Medicine, 1898)

"There are many pale faces and languid and nervous feelings attributed to other causes, when all the mischief [is due to self-abuse]."
(Sir W.C. Ellis)

"Nature seems to have fixed a strong mark on those disposed to every unnatural enjoyment, however secret their practices may be...they cannot escape detection ...[They will have] a peculiar dejection in the look...[For example, one patient] would sit in one position nearly all day; he appeared even reluctant to answer in monosyllables...could not look in the face even his most intimate friends, but always inclined his eyes downwards...I accidentally discovered from a friend of his, that he had been addicted to the most disgusting practice of secret pollution...[Another young man] became addicted to this vice, was gloomy and [habitually silent], shunned his friends, and indeed all society, sought solitude, and his eyes were always cast down - in fact he was to all appearance miserable..."
(Edward L. Baker, M.D., The Medical Examiner, 1846)

  "...they have an apathetic expression of the countenance...They become indifferent to amusements which they once enjoyed, and withdraw from all society, preferring to be alone..."
(Alfred Vogel, Henry Raphael, A Practical Treatise on the Diseases of Children, 1870)

"...his spirits became painfully depressed and gloomy...[One young man] was seen by a gentleman who at once perceived, from his appearance, that he was destroying himself by his filthy and unnatural indulgence...He at once abandoned the [habit]...every one who is guilty of it, feels an instinctive shame, and deep self-loathing...They feel none of that manly confidence...they are continually oppressed with a shrinking embarrassment...the Nervous System, all along, leads the way in suffering...The special nervous properties suffer in due proportion - varying in different persons, with different peculiarities...he will be more liable to those depressions of spirits..."
(Sylvester Graham, A Lecture to Young Men on Chastity, 1838)

"A distinguished German physician, Gottlieb Wogel, gives the following truthful picture: 'The [self-abuser] gradually loses his moral faculties, he acquires a dull...embarrassed, sad, effeminate [appearance]. He becomes [idle]...he is taken by surprise and even alarmed if required simply to reply to a child's question...his memory daily losing more and more, he is unable to comprehend the most common things...they [often] fall into complete apathy...Says Dr. Debreyne: 'Consider now this imbruted and degraded being...He has sinned against God, against nature, and against himself...His dull and stupid glance can no longer raise itself toward Heaven; he no longer dares lift his miserable brow...'...Let no one delude himself with the false assumption that he can be exempt from this universal law. There can be no possible exemption!...those who practice the most limited and most occasional acts of Onanism will surely be punished in proportion to their crimes; while the very individuals who seem to escape, are those who most surely carry the punishment for the remainder of their lives...Lest we be accused of exaggerating the dangers of Onanism, we refer, in addition to the authorities already quoted, to the following, from the father of medicine to the most eminent physicians of our time, all of whom sustain every word we have uttered concerning the horrible consequences of this crime: Hippocrates...Areteus...Lomnius...Boerhaave...Hoffman...Ludwig...Kloekhof...and very many others."
(Nicholas Francis Cooke, M.D., Satan in Society: A Plea for Social Purity, 1873)

'A guilty conscience needs no accuser'...that guilty, crouching, humbled, self-debased feeling it brands right into its victims, and haunts them at church...wherever they go, and whatever they do; staring them everywhere fully in the face...As long as a boy is uncontaminated, he loves to hang around his mother, aunt, or the female who loves him...As long as it is normal he will be kind and good to girls...courteous to the female sex...but this vice...renders him disrespectful, disobedient, cross, and hateful towards them...Red pimples on the face...are a...sign of self-pollution...It is immeasurably important that parents be enabled to detect this habit in their children in order to arrest it...A shamed, mockish, repellent feeling is one of the most conspicuous..."
(Orson Squire Fowler, 1870)

Every Christian parent and pastor should want their young men and women to be full of boldness and life. This alone should lead us to reprove and rebuke all forms of fornication in this age of mockery. But this sin leads to even greater consequences, and some have testified that the following warnings are indeed true:

 

Some Likely, Far-Reaching Consequences of Self-Pollution:

"It destroys conjugal affection, perverts natural inclination..."
(Onania, 1700's)

"The functions...are greatly impaired by this unnatural practice...The appetite for such indulgence increases...[Self-pollution] is habit that tyrannizes over the mind [and] perverts the imagination...[When the young man is ready to court, false ideals have been created in his mind for so long so that the real] female associates seem...unattractive..."
(R.V. Pierce, Common Sense Medical Advisor, 1874)

"...[the unnatural gratification harms the body, so that it later impairs the natural use in marriage. It also develops]...an unhealthy degree of sensibility..."
(D.F. Bright, M.D., Medical Brief: A Monthly Journal of Scientific Medicine, 1898)

"You can never fully rid yourself of those terrible evils it inflicts...no words can adequately describe the miseries it engenders...you can ill afford to either blunt or inflame [your desires]; for it is your only medium and measure of future enjoyments..."
(Orson Squire Fowler, 1870)

"[It] sends the man back into the prison of himself...[It] calls for no sacrifices or adjustments...no demand is made on his unselfishness...In the end [his wicked imaginations] become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself..."
(C.S. Lewis)

It is Not Only a Form of Sodomy, but it Can Lead to Homosexuality:

 Historic authors often included letters from people who had been practitioners of this sin. Often, they confessed that the sin finally caused the natural use of the woman to become undesirable, as the imagination was forced to increase in demonic perversion (like a drug-addict). The Bible condemns sodomy since it is an abomination for a man to "lie with mankind":

 Leviticus 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

 The fact that a male partner pretends to be a woman (or acts the part) does not lessen the sin of sodomy. In the same way, the specific imaginations of a person do not somehow justify the homosexuality innate in the sin of self-pollution. At one time, even the "secular" researchers viewed self-pollution as the gateway to outright sodomy! James Foster Scott, M.D. (1899) writes:

 "It separates the victim further and further from women and puts him into a peculiarly unnatural relation to them...He becomes a morose, solitary, timid and cowardly semblance of manhood...he becomes...less and less a man...There is loss of manly bearing, and proneness to blush....Purity is, in fact, the crown of all real manliness...Being maintained in a constant state of lustful feeling he is liable to fall a victim to male seducers..."
(Heredity and Morals)

The influential Swiss physician, Tissot (1728-1787) also argued that self-pollution was a gateway to sodomy (Onanism, 1760). Many other subsequent researchers agreed and elaborated on this view (Richard von Krafft-Ebing).

 

Closing Observations for Avoiding and Mortifying the Sin:

"It is...often [spread] from one boy to another, and sometimes a single boy will corrupt many..."
(D.F. Bright, M.D., Medical Brief: A Monthly Journal of Scientific Medicine, 1898)

"One [boy's]...bad example [may be] imitated..."What attentive observer of human nature has not seen older boys [as though influenced by some devilish inspiration]...regard the practice of this vice, like the vile habit of smoking and chewing tobacco, as a manly accomplishment...restraint is far more manly...Let boys compete with each other in all that is worthy...in all that is just, lawful and right; such a strife will bring out the higher attributes - those crowning excellencies of character which distinguish honor and MANHOOD...[Parents hope] that their dear lads will never be guilty of indulging in so disgusting a practice...It is a false delicacy that restrains parents from fulfilling [the duty of warning]...Boys must know that they may be thrown into the company of other lads who, perhaps, have practiced [this sin] and will [entice] them to engage in the same vile habit...They must be taught to resist [these influences]...or they will be carried...to utter moral and physical ruin...Let the thoughts be directed into proper channels, and the taste for manly sports be indulged...[football, hunting, exercising, gardening, farming, care of animals, etc.]...victory implies warfare...virtue is only realized when it is a conquering force...Innocence may be passive, but virtue is...active...Just as there is no rest without coming to the Saviour, so there can be no restoration of health without due observation to physical laws - abandoning the habit of self-abuse...There must be restraint and discipline of the mind...exciting...novels describing the weaknesses of lovers - [and other] obscene books [must be abandoned]. Something practical ought to occupy the thoughts and engage the hands...Regular and vigorous exercise is necessary...[along with] a plain, wholesome diet...abstain from such stimulants as tea, coffee...tobacco...I cannot even recommend their moderate use...any faculty becomes stronger by being exercised. This is also true of [lust]. Indulgence makes it a powerful and controlling passion...[It is increased] by reading obscene books, or by allowing the mind to dwell upon lascivious subjects...associate only with those who are rigidly chaste in their...conversation..."
(R.V. Pierce, Common Sense Medical Advisor, 1874)

 "[Parents should]...render the practice of the evil as difficult as possible by exercising a strict surveillance [over young people]...punish upon detection...very severely...[but keep their sin secret from other children]..."
(Alfred Vogel, Henry Raphael, A Practical Treatise on the Diseases of Children, 1870)

"...Please listen to a little plain talk from one who loves you with a father's affection....No cause,' says Dr. Woodward, 'is more influential in producing insanity. The records of the institutions give an appalling catalogue of cases attributed to it.'...The sin of self-pollution is one of the most destructive evils ever practiced by fallen man...It lessens the dignity, manliness, nobleness, aspiration, efficiency, and power of the male...Self-pollution is As Sinful As Fornication ...God puts children into parental custody, and makes parents liable before God and man for the sins of their children...[On this issue, my writings have] saved hundreds of thousands. By what means? The let-alone policy? No, but by the 'cry-aloud-and-spare-not'...[Preachers] were you not ordained expressly to descry public vices and sins, and proclaim against them? Or, if not, then for what were you ordained?...in this respect are not almost all 'dumb dogs that will not bark'...?...'Drink of this bitter cup,' or else resign your pastorates...showing youth that self-pollution really is a great sin against God's moral laws, will effectually prevent their forming this habit, and almost always break it up after it has become seated..."
(Orson Squire Fowler, 1870)

"...the most frequent causes are evil associations...when he associates with his fellow-students, he soon finds them practicing a habit new to him, and being unwarned, he speedily follows their filthy example...A gentleman once declared that if lie should detect a person teaching this crime to his child he would shoot him on the spot; and if homicide is allowable under any circumstances, it seems to us it would be [justified here]...Confining children alone in a room by themselves is...reprehensible...The use of stimulants of any kind is a fruitful cause of the vice. Tea and coffee have led thousands to perdition in this way. The influence of tobacco is...strongly shown in this direction...the victim will resort to all manner of cunning devices to hide his vice, and will not scruple to [lie] when questioned....If a lewd thought enters the mind, dispel it at once...Wine, beer, tea, and coffee should be taken under no circumstances. The influence of coffee in stimulating the genital organs is notorious. Chocolate should be discarded also...it contains a poison practically identical with that of tea and coffee..."
(John Harvey Kellogg, Plain Facts for Old and Young, 1872)

Titus 2:6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

2 Timothy 2:22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

Finally, let the fear of God be plainly taught. Warn of millennial exclusion and the terror of the Lord. Warn of hell-fire. Our Lord was not quiet on such matters with His disciples:

Matthew 18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.

Psalms 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.

 Proverbs 16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.

There is the balance. We need to preach eternal security by grace, mercy, and the Blood of Jesus, so that the law does not stir up sin. Yet, along with this, we must preach the warnings to believers so they do not turn the grace of God into lasciviousness. May the Lord bless many young people through parents, pastors and teachers using this material to counter the evil spirit of this age that condones sin.

P.S. One single mother who worked in a copy store later admitted to me that she grabbed a copy of this paper for her own reading, and was blessed with new direction in how to deal with her teen. It is my prayer that many others will find it helpful, and the Lord will be glorified.

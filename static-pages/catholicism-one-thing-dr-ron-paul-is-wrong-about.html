        <h1>CATHOLICISM: ONE THING DR. RON PAUL IS WRONG ABOUT</h1>
        <div id="content">
            While I believe Ron Paul gave most of the best answers in the NH  Presidential â€œdebate,â€ I was troubled by his answer concerning illegal  immigration.Â It was good that he usedÂ his answer to point out the  hypocrisy of enforcingÂ borders in the Middle East, while keeping our  borders open. However, he alsoÂ argued that we should not be hard on the  Catholic Church concerning immigration. IÂ can understand the point that  Christian churches, etc.,Â should take care of welfare. But was the  comment concerning Rome even necessary?Â OverÂ a century ago, Samuel F.B.  Morse (inventor of the telegraph),Â documented the plan of the Catholic  Church to use immigration to America to overthrow the Constitution, and  specifically the Bill of Rights. None of this history is hidden. The  quotes of popes, etc. are plain to anyone willing to read.Â The Vatican  has its own government, and it requiresÂ allegiance.Â This is not merely a  religious liberty issue. Should we allow people into America,  illegally, who have allegiance to other governments? As much as I love  RonÂ Paulâ€™s liberty issues,Â which usually getÂ to the rootÂ Â problems, I do  wish that his eyes wouldÂ be opened to see howÂ Rome is against  everything he believes.

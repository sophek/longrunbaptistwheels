            THE TWO-FOLD COMING AND THE IMMINENCY - BY I.M. HALDEMAN (1906)
"The Scriptures teach that while the coming of Christ is one great event, it has two distinct parts or stages....Two-foldedness is the thought which leaps along all the lines proclaiming the Coming of our Lord. The symbols proclaim it. The morning star is a symbol. The rising sun is a symbol. The morning star comes before the sun. It gives no shattering, awakening signs of its coming. It comes at the hour when the night is disputing with the morn. It comes when all the lowlands are in depths of darkness, when the mountain peaks stand out against a tremulous sky, and the myriad stars seem like the eyes of watchers waiting for the dawn....Shadows and shapes come and go...The star has come and gone and the interval between the star and the sun is on. The sun comes after the star has gone... The coming of the day has been one, but the manner of its coming has been two. These symbols have been applied by divine authority to the Coming of Christ. His Coming is compared to the morning star. Hear His own Word: 'I am the bright and morning star.' Revelation 22:16. He will come like that bright and morning star...He will call, but it will be unheard save by those who have walked in His reflected light and owned His name. Then He will withdraw as the morning star seems to fade away, and the interval between star-rise and sunshine will be on. His Coming is compared to the sunrise. Hear the words of the prophet: 'But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings.' Malachi 4:2...The world and all that is therein shall know that the God of day has come. The Coming of the Christ of God will be but one coming, but the manner thereof will be two. It will be as star-rise and sun-rise...The thief comes in order before the lightning. A thief come snot when every flash may reveal him...There is but one Coming, but two-fold and as distinct in manner, as the coming of a thief is distinct from the coming of the lightning....then the Coming of Christ has two distinct parts; one part in which He is manifested; another part in which He is unmanifested..."

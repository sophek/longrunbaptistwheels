THE CHASTE BRIDE AND MR. STATE, By Joey Faust
****************************************************

Revelation 17:1 ...Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the
great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication...

The late Malachi Martin was a devout Catholic writer. In his book, "The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Church" (1981), he rebuked the Catholic
Church for spiritual fornication with the kings of the earth. He writes:

"He [Constantine on his death bed] was silent after that, like a true
soldier facing death. And those around him said afterward that he seemed
to regret the triumph he afforded Christianity and the sword by which he
had given the blessing to the Roman pontiff and his church. They heard him
say before he died: 'Not the sword!...Not the
sword!...Knowledge!....'....We know of over forty popes who bought their
way into the papacy....It was a great chance. It would never return again.
For the first time in over one thousand years, Roman churchmen as a group
had the opportunity to renounce all worldly power, to escape the mesh of
politics, and to wield only spiritual authority. As yet, there had been no
Luther, no Reformation....It would have meant giving up ambition, money,
temporal authority, family glory, diplomatic might, and panoply. And, in
the end, Roman churchmen simply could not do that."

It is certainly a strange situation to see a devout Catholic so concerned
about the compromise of his church, while there are so few Biblical
churches who appear at all worried about their own spiritual adultery with
the State. It is crucial that Christians awake in these last days and
preserve the purity of our local churches:

2 Corinthians 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I
have espoused you to ONE HUSBAND, that I may present you as a CHASTE
VIRGIN to Christ.
3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ.

The church is likened unto a "bride." It should therefore not go unnoticed
that the WORLD is called a "HE" in the Authorized Version:

John 15:19 If ye were of the WORLD, the world would love HIS own: but
because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
therefore the world hateth you.

To stay pure, the church must not have "wrong relations" with Mr. World
(Proverbs 2:11-12). She must, as a chaste virgin, keep her garments
(Revelation 16:15), and place nothing that belongs to Christ under the
authority or whims of the world (i.e. State, etc.).

But we must first lay a proper foundation by examining the truths on the
other side. Individual Christians should submit and even go an extra mile
in obedience to authorities (Matthew 5:41). Although our Lord was by no
means a "new-world-order-compromising publican" (Luke 13:32), He also was
not an insurrectionist like Barabbas (Mark 15:7, John 18:36). This is a
delicate balance. An officer compelling only one mile of service is
oppressive. But our Lord taught His followers to be peaceful, and even go
an EXTRA mile under such oppression in order to grace the Gospel, and
avoid unnecessary entanglements and hindrances (Hebrews 12:1, 2 Timothy
2:4, Matthew 5:41). This would not only free the Christian to make the
most of his time on earth for the Gospel (Matthew 5:25, Ephesians 5;16),
but it would also go far in dispelling the lying rumors of those who were
seeking every opportunity to shame the truth (1 Peter 2:14-15). One of the
earliest, (non-inspired) Christian writers, long before Constantine,
wrote:

"And when you hear that we look for a kingdom, you suppose, without making
any inquiry, that we speak of a human kingdom; whereas we speak of that
which is with God, as appears also from the confession of their faith made
by those who are charged with being Christians, though they know that
death is the punishment awarded to him who so confesses. For if we looked
for a human kingdom, we should also deny our Christ, that we might not be
slain; and we should strive to escape detection, that we might obtain what
we expect. But since our thoughts are not fixed on the present, we are not
concerned when men cut us off....And more than all other men are we your
helpers and allies in promoting peace....But you seem to fear lest all men
become righteous, and you no longer have any to punish. Such would be the
concern of public executioners, but not of good princes." (Justin Martyr,
A.D. 100-165, "First Apology")

But every truth must be balanced by the truth on the other side, or else
we have heresy. And we must be extra careful when responding to any
heresy, or unbalance of truth, not to flee recklessly to the other side,
and thereby simply create an opposing heresy. Our Lord, while commanding
peaceful self-denial in His servants, and obedience to civil magistrates,
was also sure to remind them that HE was their LORD (John13:13). And He
also limited any authority of the State to its own proper sphere or realm
(Mark 12:17). Authority out of place is perverted authority:

"God has granted to the State no authority in the sphere of revealed
religion." (D. M. Panton, 1923)

"God has given no authority whatever to rulers in the sphere of the
relations of His creature man to Himself, the Creator. In this realm the
ruler is a trespasser...1 Peter 2:13 lays down no UNLIMITED duty of
obedience to rulers but asserts only that general principle of obedience
which is, however, subject to very definite and far-reaching exceptions.
Such unlimited obedience can only be given at the cost of rendering unto
Caesar the things that are God's, a far more serious offence...for to rob
God is more heinous than to rob man....When [the ruler] trespasses into
the realm of religion, he has forthwith no claim to obedience, but it is
rather the duty of the subject to disobey...In the sphere of religion the
subject should decline all discussion and negotiation with authorities. To
negotiate ADMITS THAT BOTH PARTIES HAVE SOME RIGHTS..." (G. H. Lang, 1955)

For this reason, Christians are taught in the Bible to "obey God rather
than men" (Acts 5:29) when the State attempts to forbid obedience to
Christ, or force disobedience to Him.

The Church, the Family and the State are three different realms of
authority under God. When the State attempts to usurp the authority of the
Family or Church in their God-ordained realms, it is out of place. For
example, the education and moral upbringing of children lies under the
authority of fathers submitted to Christ. The State must not interfere.
Likewise, sermons of preachers should not be shackled by regulations or
restraints. The God-ordained activities of our churches must not be
controlled by another head.

To arrive at a proper balance, it might be helpful to notice the limits of
the authority of a husband over a wife. Peter, in discussing submission,
lists its various spheres:

1 Peter 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man FOR THE LORD'S
SAKE: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment
of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
15 For SO IS THE WILL OF GOD, that with well doing ye may put to silence
the ignorance of foolish men:
18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the
good and gentle, BUT ALSO TO THE FROWARD.
3:1 LIKEWISE, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if
ANY OBEY NOT the word, they also may without the word be won by the
conversation of the wives;
6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are,
as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

In this section of Scripture (1 Peter 2:13-3:6), we have the submission of
Christians to the State, the submission of servants to masters, and the
submission of wives to husbands. These situations, although differing,
were also similar in at least one respect. It was likely that both masters
and husbands would oftentimes be unconverted, and/or disobedient (1 Peter
2:18, 3:1). The magistrates at the time also were torching many
Christians. Therefore, the question of REBELLION was at this time surely
and desperately brought before the Apostles concerning every sphere of
authority. And the Holy Ghost gives His answer.

Peter illustrates the obedience of wives to DISOBEDIENT husbands by using
the example of Sarah in the Old Testament. The principle examples in
Scripture of Sarah's obedience (without the word), to a disobedient
husband (1 Peter 3:1), are found when Abraham (more than once) told her to
tell a king that she was his sister (Genesis 12:12, 20:2). In this way,
she would be giving out that they were not married. And although Abraham
reasoned he would not be slain by this scheme, she nevertheless, would
thereby encourage the king to "have eyes for her" and she would risk being
married away or physically abused! What should Sarah do in this situation?
It was not technically a lie. But it was a form of deception. SHE would
not handle this situation this way if SHE was in charge (she no doubt
thought in disgust). Should she disobey her husband's request? It could be
slightly argued (on a technicality) that it WAS a gray, unclear issue.
Sarah gave the benefit of the doubt to her authority. The Lord then
intervened and Sarah was saved, and her husband was blessed with riches
(Genesis 20:14). Sarah had to greatly "trust in God" (1 Peter 3:5) to
submit to her husband in such a trying situation. These examples (Genesis
12 and 20) do not excuse Abraham's handling of such affairs. But they do
provide a good example of how to submit to any authority in its proper
sphere, where the issue is somewhat cloudy.

The same thing may be observed in the case of Vashti in Esther 1. There
is no evidence that the king desired anything unclean. He only wanted to
show off her beauty. However, the situation is similar to the situations
in Genesis with Abraham and Sarah. It is similar in that commentators are
divided (as in Genesis 12 and 20) over whether or not the authority is
commanding sin. This, in itself, proves that the issue is a bit gray and
fuzzy. But unlike Sarah, Vashti was QUICK to find an excuse for
"justified" rebellion. And she lost her kingdom because of it! God
"intervened" by REPLACING her.

We must tread carefully upon this delicate ground. But let us notice one
last example. Naaman in 2 Kings 5:18 asks the prophet Elisha about a
matter that is troubling him. His master is a pagan and he desires Naaman
to support him physically when he bows down to idols. But apparently,
Naaman has seen the vanity of these false gods of sticks and stones.
Elisha's response appears to argue that Naaman would not be held
responsible for helping the king in his capacity as servant. The authority
bears the responsibility. However, this does not mean that God would
ignore Naaman willfully worshipping these false gods. This gives us a key
to handling some difficult questions concerning submission (in whatever
realm) when we are not dealing with blatant sin.

These examples teach us that in issues that are not clear, the authority
should prayerfully be given the benefit of the doubt. The responsibility
is upon its head:

"...in any case of doubt the individual must submit to the authority. The
duty to disobey must be clear, not obscure or doubtful....We must obey God
rather than men (Acts 5:29), whenever their orders clash. Yet the clash
must be evident, not imaginary." (G. H. Lang, 1955)

People with a rebellious spirit will grab at any speck of apparent sin in
authority and use it as an excuse to rebel. Whether it be against a
pastor, a husband, a father, or a policeman, it is too often man's nature
to take advantage of anything that would justify rebellion or disrespect.
The Scriptures place a "check" on this spirit by using the obedience of
Sarah in a confusing and perilous situation. She trusted God, obeyed, and
was blessed in the end.

The Scriptures describe the last days as days of rebellion against
AUTHORITY in every realm (2 Timothy 3:1-2, 6):

Jude 1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, DESPISE
DOMINION, and speak evil of dignities.
9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed
about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation,
but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

The Holy Ghost has again insured the application by illustration for any
seeking saint. He gives the example of Michael, one of the highest angels,
in dealing with the DEVIL. Who can be more evil than the Devil? But
notice, there is no "railing accusation" against him by Michael. Peter
also describes the last times in similar language:

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
uncleanness, and DESPISE GOVERNMENT. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled,
they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing
accusation against them before the Lord.

Many church services (especially in charismatic circles) "motivate" the
congregation by screaming, "Satan! You miserable worm! I am going to step
on your face!" The crowd then goes wild. And surely, every Christian at
some point in his or her life, has seen the televangelists "pray" to God:

"Dear God, we come to you now in the name of Jesus. Satan! Right now I
bind you! You serpent of Hell, I now take dominion! I command you to
flee..."

The prayer to "Jesus" goes on praying to SATAN for another fifteen minutes
in disobedience to Jude 1:9. Satan is not an authority over Christians;
however, the Bible forbids such railing accusations in the flesh against
devils. However, surely Jude and Peter are also using this example of
Michael and Satan to provide Christians with an example of how to treat
earthly rulers inspired by Satan. There is a place for humble, but strong
rebuke (Mark 6:18). Yet, children to fathers, wives to husbands,
Christians to church officers, and citizens to magistrates, must all avoid
the FLESH motivated rebellion that Scripture predicted would come upon the
whole world, with many Laodicean (Gr. "rights of the people") Christians
leading the pack.

At this point, we must turn our eyes to the other side. A wife (unlike
what John R. Rice appeared to teach - though I am thankful for most of
what he says on the subject) is NOT BOUND before God to kill her child or
rob a bank or confess that Caesar is God simply because her husband
commands it. She, like a Christian under the State, ought to obey God
rather than men in such obvious, sinful situations!:

Hebrews 11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of
his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and THEY WERE NOT
AFRAID OF THE KING'S COMMANDMENT.

Daniel 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the
king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are NOT CAREFUL to answer thee in THIS matter.

Therefore, in every realm of submission, we must guard against jumping at
every gray area for an excuse to rebellion or reviling dignities (Exodus
22:28). Men should demonstrate to their wives and children how they expect
to be honored by their own respect to elders and State magistrates.
However, we also have a clear responsibility before God to RESIST and
disobey every command that calls for definite sin, or any command that is
out of its proper sphere of ordained authority.

There is a place for the church as the light of the world to shine the
light of conviction and reproof and to expose sin that sinners may know
their need for the Saviour. We will all stand at the Judgment Seat of
Christ for how we handle this delicate balance. Jesus called Herod a fox
(Luke 13:32); yet Paul apologized for his words to the high priest (Acts
23:5), since he said them in ignorance. Both of these sides must be kept,
prayerfully, in proper balance:

Ecclesiastes 3:1 To every thing there is a season...
7 ...a time to keep silence, and a time to speak...

At times, Christians are carnal because they do not want a prophet to
rebuke in the gate (Amos 5:10). Their ears are delicate from being
scratched and pampered by the world. They do not mind sitting in front of
movies and television that mock and blaspheme our Lord; but if a Christian
shouts, or uses irony, or is too plain in rebuking sin, they get their
feelings hurt and cannot endure it (2 Timothy 4:3). Spurgeon once
preached:

"It is impossible but that the Church of Rome must spread, when we who are
the watch-dogs of the fold are silent, and others are gently and smoothly
turfing the road, and making it as soft and smooth as possible, that
converts may travel down to the nethermost hell of Popery....The velvet
has got into our ministers' mouths of late, but we must unrobe ourselves
of soft raiment, and truth must be spoken, and nothing but truth; for of
all lies which have dragged millions down to hell..." (June 5th, 1864)

However, we must not forget that our Lord did not return railing for
railing (1 Peter 2:23, 3:9). Paul, in wisdom, guarded his words to
magistrates. A fool's wrath is presently known says the Bible; he has no
ability to hide his shame. He is therefore headed for destruction, and his
mouth is leading the way (Proverbs 12:13-14). He is indiscrete and carnal,
and if his wife, children, or church members "honored" his authority the
way he treats authorities over him, his heart would literally die within
him, and he would become as a stone, like old Nabal (1 Samuel 25:37)!

We must live by the truth on both sides. It is therefore crucial, in these
perilous times, that Christians begin to discuss openly the delicate
relationship of our churches to the State. As we behold today the
"Faith-Based and Community Initiative," and the silence of many of our
preachers on various moral issues (lest they lose their 501c3), is it not
time to have some OPEN discussion, and debates, in our publications and
churches concerning whether or not the Bride is presently compromising
herself with Mr. World? Earlier Christians appeared to be more awake to
the dangers of compromising the bride by wrong relations to the State. But
today, there is hardly a voice crying out for her to "keep her garments"
and tell Mr. World to keep his eyes and hands to himself. A chaste bride
has the moral responsibility to CRY OUT if she is in danger of being
compromised:

Deuteronomy 22:23 If a damsel that is a virgin be BETROTHED UNTO AN
HUSBAND, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye
shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, BECAUSE SHE CRIED
NOT, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his
neighbour's wife:

There were many fervent prayers to God and public cries in earlier
generations, as they saw the compromises developing. They knew that the
Roman Catholic Harlot would one day come back in power (Revelation 17),
and they were keen to watch for any signs of their churches flirting with
the kings of the world. However, in our age, many churches are no longer
crying out about compromises with the State. They are enjoying the
relationship with all its benefits. And the rope keeps getting tighter.

Notice some words from earlier Christians:

"If history is any guide...the very first step which every dictatorship
will take, will be to coerce, or to seduce, or to suppress the Christian
Church within its frontiers." ("The British Weekly," June 8, 1933)

"...V. F. Calverton in his recent book 'The passing of the God's' (1935)
states that in the Middle Ages 'the Church [was] imposing an international
outlook upon the State,' whereas 'in the modern world the State, disallied
from the Church, imposes its national outlook upon the latter.'....the
cleavage between Protestantism and Catholicism is largely disappearing at
the present time....Only by seeing that these very events are predicted by
the Bible of the last days is it possible to see that the appalling sins
of Christendom constitute no argument whatever against the Christian
faith, but must rather convince us of its truth." (R. E. D. Clark, "The
Church of Rome and the State", 1936)

"The choice is everywhere being forced upon the Church whether she will
stand under the Sovereignty of Christ, or become subordinate and
subservient to the National cause in each nation. We ought to obey God
rather than men (Acts v. 29)."
(D. M. Panton, 1933)

ROBERT GOVETT ON THE ADULTERY OF THE BRIDE WITH THE STATE (1845):

Bishop Warburton (1698-1779), of the Church of England, in 1736, wrote,
"The Alliance between Church and State; or the Necessity and Equity of an
Established Religion." Notice that title! In beholding the perilous times
the Bible predicts for the near future (Revelation 17, etc.), Robert
Govett's (1813-1901) criticism of Warburton is timely:

"He [Warburton] first occupies himself in showing that the Church and
State are each sovereign and independent the one of the other. He then
observes, that for mutual advantage a 'political league and alliance for
mutual support and defense' is entered into. The motive of the ruler to
seek the alliance of the church he declares to be, the service rendered to
him in procuring reverence for himself and the laws, and the obtaining
power over the church, so as to prevent it from exciting sedition or
ill-will against his government. The motive of the church he represents as
being, protection. 'The Church flies for protection to the State.'....From
these motives the alliance springs, and terms are: 'That the Church shall
apply its UTMOST INFLUENCE IN THE SERVICE OF (alas) THE STATE!' and that
for its part, 'the State shall SUPPORT and PROTECT the Church.' The Church
in this alliance as the weaker of the two contracting parties, must
surrender, as he says, its independence, and receive in return (1) a
settled maintenance for its ministers....(2) The second benefit is
ecclesiastical power of coercion exercised in the bishop's courts....In
this melancholy picture, we find the leaven of Judaism and of the world at
every turn....Let us then contemplate the results of this alliance to the
Church, and see how utterly fallen it is from its true position as the
waiting, pure, espoused virgin of Christ:

1. It seeks PROTECTION from an arm of flesh. And thus it deserts the
protection of its Lord and Master, Christ Jesus, as though that were
insufficient...

2. It becomes supported by the world, as though Christ were so ignorant or
careless of its necessity, that He could not, or would not provide.

3. It takes ANOTHER HEAD AND HUSBAND THAN JESUS. The civil Magistrate is
its head and husband by the terms of alliance; and as THE CHURCH CANNOT
HAVE TWO HEADS AND HUSBANDS AT ONCE, Jesus is not only slighted, but
rejected. This is that spiritual fornication and adultery of which Rome
and her daughters stand accused: Rev. xvii, 2-5.

4. It therefore becomes obedient to the will of the Magistrate, as the
same writer states it, 'When the alliance is made, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE
CHURCH UNDER HIS DIRECTION, he hath then authority to prescribe such
public exercises of religion, in such manner and such seasons as the
exigencies of the STATE REQUIRE.' Its ministers become, in the main, HIS
ministers. 'The civil Magistrate being the protector of the Church, and
consequently SUPREME HEAD AND DIRECTOR OF IT, the ministry is much in his
power...He admits and excludes to the exercise of their functions AS HE
SEES FIT.'

5. It is incapable of action without permission....She can excommunicate
none without the State's consent.

6. She receives and exercises temporal power instead of the spiritual
power which her Lord gave her...

7. Lastly, the object of the Church is expressly declared to be - not the
glory of God - not the service of Christ Jesus alone, but - the 'service
of the State' that is, of the world! Thus is the aim and object of the
Church turned utterly aside. In place of WITNESSING TO THE WORLD THAT IT
IS EVIL, in rebellion against God, and soon to be visited by the coming
wrath of Messiah, the visible Church, believing that it is possible to
serve 'two masters,' joins hands and fellowship with it, and devotes
herself to its service. She takes the civil governor as her head and
ruler, in place of the Holy Ghost, whom the Lord Jesus left her as her
appointed guardian and guide. And as Israel's desire for a king was the
rejection of Jehovah, so is the making a king the supreme head of the
church the rejecting both of Christ Jesus and of His Spirit....

The issue of the alliance of the Church with the State (or world) was most
disastrous [in history]. Wealth and splendor, power and dignity followed.
Worldly philosophy and eloquence crept in, to corrupt the gospel. The
rulers of the world interfered in the government of the church....And, as
there are two forms of leaven, so there are two gigantic iniquities which
divide the world between them at the close - lawlessness - and bondage to
the law, or Christianity Judaized. The Judaizing of Christianity is seen
in Babylon, the Great Harlot; the lawlessness of the visible church
discharges itself at length into the bottomless gulf of the delusions of
Antichrist."

CONCLUSION

We must not fail to notice the intrusion of the State into religion, and
cry out as commanded. Are there no signs of such intrusion today in the
U.S.? I would like to see the following questions discussed openly in more
Christian magazines and papers:

1. Should a preacher, called by God, make an agreement to be silent on
certain political issues of the day for benefits?

2. If preachers are not silenced in certain areas by 501c3, then why did
James Kennedy and many others recently appeal to Congress to either repeal
the prohibition on preachers influencing politics in a "substantial"
manner, or else properly define the vague term "substantial"? (The
Internal Revenue Service has not defined the word "substantial," so
nonprofits have to guess; therefore most do not "rock the boat" on any hot
issue, and many even hire lawyers to edit their sermons).

3. If we say we will never be silenced and we will preach God's truth on
any subject under 501c3, is this honest (Romans 1:31) when we have made an
agreement to receive benefits on the basis that we will not influence
politics "substantially"? Would it not indeed be more honest to hire
lawyers to read our sermons to make sure we are honoring our side of the
deal?

I am not calling Christians to leave the spiritual keys and bury their
talents in order to be distracted with every wind of political
controversy. God forbid! We must preach the Gospel. However, I believe it
is necessary and timely to discuss these questions openly. We are not
called to be obedient in one area only. How easily early Christians could
have rationalized: "I will simply say Caesar is God. I don't really mean
it. And think of all the soul winning I can do if I am not martyred." The
Boy Scouts are just the beginning of an assault that is planned on
Christian churches. An argument that these people will never tire of using
to advance sodomy and other forms of wickedness is: "If this is a
non-profit, government-created organization, then why is it discriminating
against government policy on gender, sexual preference and religion?"
Perhaps it is past time for the bride to take off the see-through, fancy
garments created for her by sodomite fashion designers, and put back on
her modest, chaste garments provided by Christ.

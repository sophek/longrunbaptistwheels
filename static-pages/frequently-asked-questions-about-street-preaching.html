        <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT STREET PREACHING</h1>
        <div id="content">
            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT STREET PREACHING:

Dear Reader,

Please carefully and prayerfully consider the following answers to some questions you may have about our street preaching ministry:
<em>
Proverbs 18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.</em>

<strong>1. "Why do you attempt to evangelize people by speaking to them? Shouldn't we just live a good life and build relationships with people?"</strong>

Often this question is followed by a statement, beginning with the words, "I just feel that this type of approach..." This reveals the problem. As Christians, we are commanded to use the Bible as our guidebook. Repeatedly, the Bible teaches that we should tell people the Gospel, and the other truths of God's Word, verbally:

<em>Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come...</em>

Clearly, every believer (him that heareth) is to say "come" to others! We should indeed live a good life before others. But that is only part of our responsibility. We are also commanded to speak to others about the Gospel, and invite them to be saved. The woman at the well, after knowing Jesus for only a few minutes, went into the city to tell others, verbally, about Him!:

<em>John 4:28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</em>

This is the responsibility of all believers:

<em>Mark 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</em>

<em>Matthew 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</em>

<strong>2. "Shouldn't we just speak to people individually? Why do you preach openly and publicly to crowds?"</strong>

The above verse in Matthew 10:27 commands us to preach upon the housetops (publicly, to crowds). Jesus is our example, and He often spoke to people individually (Nicodemus, the woman at the well, etc.), and also in crowds:

<em>Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</em>

<em>Matthew 11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</em> 

<em>John 7:37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</em>

The Apostles also used public preaching:

<em>Acts 2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem...</em>

<em>Acts 3:12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel...</em>

<em>Acts 17:22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens...</em>

Even the woman at the well spoke to more than one person in the city:

<em>John 4:28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men...</em>

In this, she was like Wisdom in the Book of Proverbs:

<em>Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words...</em>

If we are wise, we will obey God and do the same thing!:

<em>Proverbs 11:30...he that winneth souls is wise.</em>

<strong>3. "But some people in a crowd will often want to dispute. Isn't it always wrong to argue?"</strong>

There are certainly times or situations when we should avoid debating:
<em>
Proverbs 26:4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</em>

However, there are also times when we should give a clear answer - even to people that are being foolish:

<em>Proverbs 26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</em>

Notice how Paul often disputed publicly for Jesus and His truth:
<em>
Acts 9:29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</em>

Notice, Paul didn't think he needed to change his message because some people didn't like it. They were so angry they sought to kill him! Notice again:

<em>Acts 17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</em>

Preaching to a crowd often creates a stir, and results in various, individual discussions, and many of these can be fruitful:

<em>Acts 28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
</em> 

<strong>4. "Isn't it wrong to reprove others?"</strong>

It is interesting that many people who believe it is always wrong to argue, or even reprove others, have one exception to their rule! They do not mind reproving street preachers! If it is always wrong to tell others that they are wrong, then why do these people tell preachers that they are wrong for telling others that they are wrong? Many people strongly feel that street preaching is sinful (even though it is found so often in the Bible). They are indeed silent in the face of people who are guilty of infanticide, sodomy, taking the name of the Lord in vain, unbelief, profanity, immodesty, etc. But when they see a public preacher, they suddenly become "street preachers" themselves! Only their message is a sharp, loud, angry rebuke: "Thou shalt not preach to others or reprove them about anything - especially on a street corner! You should mind your own business like I do!"

Let us see if it is always wrong to reprove others:
<em>
Leviticus 19:17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</em>

This verse teaches that true love help others, so they will not be hurt by their sins:

<em> Proverbs 27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love. 6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.[/em]

<em> 2 Timothy 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine...</em>

It is true that we must not reprove others in a hyprocritical fashion (like when people rebuke others for rebuking others!). Jesus taught that we should repent in our own lives, and then help others see their errors:

<em>Matthew 7:5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</em> 

<em>James 5:20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</em>

<strong>5. "But where does the Bible teach that it is proper to reprove lost people (non-Christians)?"</strong>

<em>Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</em>

And we have already seen that Jesus upbraided whole cities for their unbelief:

<em>Matthew 11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</em>

John the Baptist reproved unbelievers:

<em>Matthew 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers...</em>

He even reproved king Herod for his many evils:

<em>Luke 3:18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
</em>
 
Jesus also spoke sharply to proud unbelievers that did not think that they needed a Saviour:

<em>Matthew 23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</em>

And Paul sharply rebuked a sorcerer who scorned his preaching:

<em>Acts 13:10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind...</em>

Stephen, in the Bible, also used sharpness with the unbelieving crowd:

<em>Acts 7:51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.</em>

<em>Acts 7:54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</em>

Furthermore, in the so-called "Bible belt," there are many believers in the crowds. For 20 years, we have observed a majority of people that walk by say or imply that they are believers, or that they think they are saved because they are good, etc.

<strong>6. "But what good does sharp, stern preaching do for lost people?"</strong>

Every preacher should be led by the Holy Ghost. One place may call for sharper preaching than another place. And the Bible teaches that we should make a difference (distinction) based upon whom we are preaching to:

<em>Jude 1:22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</em>

We should never be arrogant, profane, or sinful in our speech or actions toward others:

<em>2 Timothy 2:24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, 25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves...</em>

We do not always preach "John the Baptist" style. There have been times when we have simply prayed with people and given out free, cold bottled water, with tracts about the need for everyone to believe in Jesus as Saviour to live forever with God. (We were finally forbidden by the Fort Worth officials from bringing an ice chest downtown).

Many who have seen people from Kingdom Baptist preaching in downtown Fort Worth, or at an event, know only this side. But we have often fed the homeless (even bringing a bus load to our church to eat and be clothed). The children of Kingdom Baptist Church may be found ministering with a sign language program to the deaf, or performing Christian songs at an elderly home. We have door to door evangelism, which is often of a different nature than open-air street preaching. Even in open street preaching, there are times of praying with people, and speaking gently in one-on-one discussion. The Bible in Jude 1:22-23, teaches that the manner in which we evangelize should be based upon certain factors: What type of "ground" are we sowing the "seed" in?

Conversion of sinners, in the Bible, is likened to farming. A farmer must plow, and sow and water and reap:

<em>1 Corinthians 3:6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</em>

Tender ground needs only seed and water, prayer and patience. Harder ground (a stubborn heart) needs warnings, reproof (plowing), and prayer and patience. The people of God often make many excuses for not plowing (warning presumptuous sinners):

<em>Proverbs 20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold...</em>

As hearts grow colder in these last days, many Christians are growing lazy and weary of the old methods. They are looking for new, easier ways, that do not require work, or result in persecution.

Jesus knew how to make a distinction in people. Christians should be led of the Lord, and pray for wisdom in what approach to use with people. When people were sincere, or broken, Jesus always used gentleness and compassion (though even then, He warned them to "sin no more"):

<em>John 8:10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</em>

He told the woman at the well that she had had five husbands (John 4), and that her people "worship ye know not what." Nevertheless, in such situations Jesus was gentle, and He used softer language than He used sometimes with others:

<em>Matthew 12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break...</em>

But when people (even unbelievers) were proud and rebellious, and had rejected light, Jesus used sharper language. We have already quoted Matthew 11:20-22, where Jesus upbraided whole cities for their unbelief, and warned them about Hell. We have seen how He dealt with the Pharisees, who thought they were good enough already, and did not need salvation by the Blood of Jesus (Matthew 23). There are times when this type of preaching will cause some proud people to hear and believe (by God's grace). Paul almost persuaded Felix as he reasoned about righteousness and judgment to come!:

<em>Acts 24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</em>

In an age that has replaced Biblical Christianity with psychology and positive thinking, many people do not have a realization of their sinfulness, or need of God. The Holy Ghost sometimes uses strong preaching of the Word to bring conviction of sin - if not immediately, perhaps at a later time.

<strong>7. "But the fruit of the Holy Spirit includes love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, etc. These things do not seem compatible with street preaching."</strong> 

Jesus was filled with the Spirit, and He preached publicly and strongly. Paul was said to be filled with the Holy Ghost when he called the sorcerer a child of the Devil. Notice what Jesus said the Holy Spirit will do when He comes:

<em>John 16:8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</em>

This is exactly what Paul did when he made Felix tremble. Jesus was hated because He was full of the Spirit of God, reproving the world of sin:

<em>John 7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</em>

In this day and age, many believers are simply uninformed about their responsibility to preach publicly. Many do not want to be informed. They wish to avoid persecution or shame, therefore they hide the truth. Instead of warning lost sinners that they are headed to a place of eternal torment without God, they take the easy path. But Jesus warned against this approach:

<em>Luke 6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</em>

<em>Luke 9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</em>

<em>Matthew 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. 28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</em>

<em>Matthew 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</em>

Also, the first fruit of the Spirit mentioned is love (Galatians 5:22). But the Bible often shows that true love has a tough side (Proverbs 27:5, 13:24, Leviticus 19:17, etc.). Would it be loving to enable a drug addict? Would it be loving to be silent and allow a friend to go down this road of ruin? In the same way, is it loving to be "nice" to people, but never warn them that they are in danger of eternal ruin? The Bible teaches that God will judge sin, now and later. But it also teaches that sin has its own curses (Proverbs 5:22). Is it really loving to make people feel warm and comfortable, yet leave them to suffer these consequences that might have been avoided?

<strong>8. "But people must make their own choices."</strong>

Yes. And we can make the choice to obey God or to disobey Him by refusing to warn others about the coming judgment of God. We cannot make people change. But we can at least compel them to change, by warning them. Both saint and sinner will experience God's future judgment:

<em>1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
</em>

In light of this fact, a loving Christian will warn others:

<em>2 Corinthians 5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men...</em>

<em>Colossians 1:28 Whom we preach, warning every man...</em> 

<em>Jude 1:14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed...</em>

What did God think about Enoch preaching in such a manner?:

<em>Hebrews 11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</em>

As Christians, it is our responsibility to warn others about the consequences of sin:

<em>Ezekiel 3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</em>

<strong>9. "Do you believe that God hates sinners?"</strong>

It is a Biblical fact that God loves all sinners. He loves everyone:

<em>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</em>

Theologians in earlier ages called this the "benevolent" love of God. We should likewise have this love for every man - regardless of how wicked he is:
<em>
1 Thessalonians 3:12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men...</em>

If we did not posses this love toward all men, we would let them suffer the consequences of their sins without instruction or warning. When Jonah, an Old Testament prophet of God, sinned in hating the Assyrians, he refused to even give them a Biblical warning of judgment. He ran away from public preaching! He did not want them to fear, and hope in God's mercy, and amend their ways.

In contrast to Jonah, true, benevolent love will motivate us to persuade and compel people to know God, and obey Him - even if they at first, do not like to hear the instruction or warning. Love hopes and prays that later, they will think about what was said:
<em>
Proverbs 28:23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</em>

<em>2 Timothy 2:9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</em>

We have had many reports of people that later thought about what they heard or read, and were thankful for the warnings:

<em>Proverbs 15:31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</em>

On the other hand, the earlier theologians also often spoke of another love, that they called complacent love (see Oxford Dict., under love; or the writings by Finney, Edwards, and many others). We also see this love in the Bible (though not by that name). God loves all sinners benevolently. But He does not get good feelings from rebellious sinners. He does not delight in them. This is what many Bible verses refer to when they speak of God hating or abhoring sinners:

<em>Psalms 11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</em>

[See also Psalms 10:3, Proverbs 6:16-19, etc.]

<em>Psalms 97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil...</em>

Therefore, we must learn to love people in the right way:

<em>Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</em>

What some people call "loving sinners" is sometimes what God calls "justifying the wicked":

<em>Proverbs 17:15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.</em>

In a similar way, the more we grow as Christians to be like our Father, the more we will grow, paradoxically, in our benevolent love for sinners, and in our disgust at sin:

<em>Proverbs 29:27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</em>

It is, however, important to remember that all believers were once lost, foolish, misguided, etc:

<em>Titus 3:2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. 3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</em>

We at Kingdom Baptist strive to maintain the proper balance between a tough, responsible love that warns (1 Thessalonians 2:11), and a more gentle love that encourages, etc., (1 Thessalonians 2:7); and likewise between the benevolent love of sinners, and the proper disdain of evil. We do not claim to be perfect in maintaining these important balances - no Christian is. There are times when we feel that we may have been too firm in warning or compelling sinners. At other times, we may feel that we have been too light or careless with them. 

We will all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ to see how well we have labored for Jesus. Many Christians, instead of working, spend their time eating and drinking with the drunken, and criticizing others who work in the field, trying to be faithful:

<em>Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; 49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</em>

<em>Matthew 24:50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</em>
<strong>
10. "But didn't Jesus eat and drink with rebellious sinners"?</strong>

There were gladiator theaters in the land in the days of Jesus (see Josephus); but we never see Jesus attending them. We do, however, see Him holding a Bible study with sinners who wanted to learn about Him (Luke 5:29). Wisdom in the Bible is seen commanding separation from sinners (Proverbs 9:6), yet, she also invites seekers to dine and learn of her ways (Proverbs 9:5). For example, it is right to preach the Gospel in the city. It would be wrong, however, for a Christian to be a drunkard, or make provision for sin.

<strong>11. "But isn't it wrong to judge or cast stones?"</strong>

When Lot reproved the Sodomites for their wickedness, they accused him of "judging" them:

<em>Genesis 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</em>
<em>
Genesis 19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge...</em>

When Moses reproved a man, he also accused Moses of "judging":

<em>Exodus 2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?...</em>

Some things never change! Today, people often take the words of Jesus out of context and accuse street preachers of judging.

It is wrong to refuse to show mercy, and actively punish ("judge") others for wrongs that we should forgive (Matthew 7:1-2, 6:14-15). But this does not mean that it is wrong to judge (in the sense of discerning) that someone is doing something wrong. It is not wrong to discern a serious fault in another person, and with the right motives, and in the right manner, seek to instruct them or warn them. Those who say we should not judge in any sense, are guilty of "judging" if they accuse someone of judging!

Jesus did teach against rash judgment (based on appearances; seeing what we want to see, etc.). He taught that we should, instead, exercise righteous judgment:

<em>John 7:24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</em>

The Lord taught that we must judge (discern) false prophets (Matthew 7:15). Clearly, there is a proper place for warning the wicked, correcting a brother, discerning evil, etc.

It is often much easier to refuse to do these things, and then tell ourselves that our laziness is actually Christian love!

As to not "throwing stones," the context of that Scripture (John 8) is referring to administering literal, capital punshment. It is not the place of individual Christians to administer the Mosaic civil laws - especially in hypocritical blindness. But this is often twisted to mean that Christians should not reprove or warn against sin and falsehood! People have done the same thing with the First Amendment and the toleration our Constitution upholds. They press this to mean that everyone must agree with every action or viewpoint! They define toleration - not as meaning that we must not execute, imprison, harm, etc., someone for differences in religion - but that we must never disagree or speak against another viewpoint! Yet, these same people are very unbalanced and "intolerant" of Biblical Christianity (and especially street preachers).

<strong>12. "But people do not like public preaching."</strong>

That is often true. It has always been this way - especially during very sinful times:
<em>
Amos 5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</em>

At times, people (even officials) will attempt to falsely accuse, or ensnare street preachers, using the law against them, dishonestly:

<em>Isaiah 29:21 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</em>
The officials in the days of Jesus often attempted to entrap Him:

<em>Luke 11:53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things: 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</em>

<em>John 7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</em>

We must not allow our light to be hidden because people hate preaching. They hate it because they hate the message. They hate the warnings. They have been raised in an educational system that is more interested in pampering their self-esteem than in teaching reading, writing and math. Many of the churches have also grown humanistic (as Charles F. Potter, the humanist, in 1930, mockingly predicted and hoped would happen to churches). Instead of worshipping God, they are often focused on entertainment, self-help seminars, and pop-psychology. In a nation, thus spoiled and pampered, it is little wonder that many cities of America despise preaching as much as the Sodomites did (Genesis 19:7,9). But this is all the more reason to lift up our voices with warnings.

This nation is ready to self-destruct, or be conquered, as it is judged by God. We are losing liberties, almost by the minute. How can things be changed? There is only way. It may be too late. The Book of Judges shows again and again, the people of God becoming enslaved when they walk away from God. Only when they cried to God and repented, were they delivered from bondage and oppression (see also 2 Chronicles 7:14). Shall we be silent at such a time? Is there not a cause?

<strong>13. "Do you believe in breaking the law?"</strong>

We believe in obeying the civil laws of man, as long as they do not interfere with God's clear commandments:

<em>Acts 5:28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name?... 29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</em>

<em>Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</em>

The Constitution of the U.S. preserves religious liberty. The First Amendment, according to men like John Locke and Bancroft (historian), was given to this nation by the Baptists. They taught it, and petitioned for it, and were finally granted it, by God's grace. If more believers do not open their mouths and begin to speak the truth, no one will be permitted to say anything. Will you not cry for mercy, and warn others to do the same? Do it for God. Do it for yourself. Do it for your children! But whether men grant liberty or not, the Lord Jesus has already given it for preaching, and He commands us to walk in it.

This is why many of the members of Kingdom Baptist preach on the street. If you are not eternally saved, please acknowledge your sin and need of Jesus Christ the Saviour, who shed His Blood to pay for your sins. Trust only in His sacrifice for you, and He will grant you mercy and the free gift of eternal life. If you are a believer, I hope some of the above words will stir you to be more vocal and public in speaking the truth of the Bible. Please pray for us as people increasingly despise anything to do with Biblical, traditional Christianity. But the Bible warned that this would occur (2 Timothy 3:1-5, etc.).

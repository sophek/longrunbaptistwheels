            MOCKERS SLUMBERING IN SODOM
(Sunday Sermon, 9-28-03)

Luke 17:28 Likewise also as it was in the DAYS OF LOT; they did eat, they
drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

The Lord teaches us that the "last days" will be as in the days of Lot
(i.e. Sodom). In a past sermon on this section, we have observed that
Sodom was filled people who were committing abominations, yet they were
not ashamed. We saw last week that when they were reproved, they kicked
back defensively by accusing Lot of "judging." We saw how such people do
not properly define the word "judging." We will continue today with one
more observation from the "days of Lot":

Genesis 19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son
in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the
city, bring them out of this place:
13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great
before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
daughters, and said, UP, GET YOU OUT of this place; for the LORD will
DESTROY this city. But HE SEEMED AS ONE THAT MOCKED unto his sons in law.
15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be
consumed in the iniquity of the city.
 
Lot was doing some fiery preaching. But Lot's words were viewed as a joke.
There is a dual problem here. I do not doubt that to some degree Lot had
spoiled his testimony by dwelling among such sinners:

2 Peter 2:8 (For that righteous man DWELLING AMONG THEM, in seeing and
hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful
deeds;)

2 Corinthians 6:17 Wherefore COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM, and be ye separate,
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,
 
It is therefore important that we obey God's warnings, and properly
separate our families, so we do not LOSE our families. And we don't want
to lose the power of our testimony. We don't want to lose our families to
the world. Sodom will suck you into it like a sewer drain. Lot only
pitched his tent "toward" Sodom (Genesis 13:12). But before you know it,
he was IN Sodom (Genesis 14:12). And his daughters were soon married to
Sodomites! Where you plant, is where you are going to take root. A man
reaps WHAT he sows; and a man also reaps WHERE he sows. There are many
applications of this, but let me give you one. Christians that accompany
friends to bars are, in the end, never taken seriously by their friends!
We see these types of Christians every week. They are guilty. They excuse
their lack of separation on the basis of "evangelism." These Christians
have not learned the lesson from Lot (which was written for our
admonition).

But it is also true that sinners can become so hardened that they will NOT
TAKE ANYTHING, OR ANYONE SERIOUSLY. And this is a good description of the
Sodomites. They would have mocked Abraham, if he had preached to them in
that final state of wickedness. Unless there is a temporary, national
revival that soon sweeps the land, and awakens sinners, I must say, that
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AT! Jesus said the last days would be "as in the days
of Lot." In the days of Lot they mocked sound preaching. They will not
endure sound doctrine (2 Timothy 4).

And if you want to be able to gauge WHERE WE ARE in relation to the last
days, simply get a history book and see where we are on the slope of
devolution. In the early 20th century, women started showing some leg,
dancing lewdly, smoking, dressing like men, leaving the home. Later, the
men started growing shaggy hair, wearing ear-rings, and girly shirts. Some
Christian lights did their best to shout out a warning that HOMOSEXUAL
PERVERSION WAS NOT FAR DOWN THE ROAD if they did not TURN BACK. But these
preachers were MOCKED as being "out of touch" with "progress." Evolution
was bringing forth its fruit. Notice these early words of I. M. Haldeman
(the pastor of First Baptist Church of New York, in the early 20th
century):

"The only thing recognized in matters of morals, the only standard for the
definition and measure of God and things divine will be personal
experience. Those who attempt to bind the conscience, direct the soul, and
set before it a definite concept of God and a fixed line of conduct in
respect to Him and to one another will be looked upon, not only as narrow
bigots, but as intolerable tyrants, as criminal hinderers to all true
knowledge. The new generation is intoxicated with the rallying cry of
'self-expression.' The new generation is letting itself go....in a few
hurrying years the moral and spiritual ruin of the coming generation
cannot be imagined."(I. M. Haldeman, 1845-1933)

But the feminists and the evolutionists only mocked such preaching! They
mocked any attempt to regenerate or even reform the younger generation
that was slipping away:
 
1921: "So it goes all over the country. Individuals and organizations are
struggling with  their fingers plugged into the dike to hold back the
flood of new morals and ethics and dress of our Younger
Generation....Stretch forth a hand anywhere in the dark and touch a school
- and you will find that some effort is being exerted to find an answer to
the problem....Reforming flappers is, so to speak, all over the place -
but it's very difficult to know which of the reformers TO TAKE SERIOUSLY."
(Helen Bullitt Lowry, 1921)

The silly feminists and their male manipulators (2 Timothy 3:6) only
laughed. They tried to paint preachers who sounded an alarm as idiots and
self-righteous fanatics:

1921: "Is there a moral decline? How very odd that any one in the United
States of America should ask such a question! No country since the world
began has had so many moral guardians, self-imposed and legal....Think of
the towns that are passing laws forbidding high heels, short skirts and
transparent blouses....There is a curious superstition - that when a
nation begins to dance ITS DOWNFALL IS AT HAND. It is true that Rome
danced....[but] they had nothing to do but amuse themselves, and naturally
grew so soft and devitalized that they would have been gobbled up in one
mouthful by any savage tribe that swept down upon them. Are we in similar
case?...'Not so's you'd notice it.' Even our large cities are only big
small towns, as plodding and respectable as the Main Streets in all
[towns]...It is a silly old superstition, and only trotted out when some
writer is hard up for publicity....Take it all in all, it seems to me that
if the United States of America is conquered by internal or external
enemies it will not be from bad morality but smug stupidity."
(Gertrude Atherton, "Is There a Decline in American Morals?," 1921;
feminist and fiction writer)

She did not mention the fact that the dancing was lewd, that many young
women were immodest, and that they were crossing lines of decency in
conduct. And when she reproved Rome for having "nothing to do but amuse
themselves," she forgot that Rome did not even have a radio. This is an
example of how people responded to the first moral landmarks and fences
being torn down in society. They MOCKED the warnings. And by doing so,
they lost the ability to EVER STOP THE DESCENT!

Not long ago, there were news reports about various school dances around
America. Schools were complaining because the children were graphically
simulating fornication (all kinds). Disc jockeys stated that they had to
play the "Barney theme" and turn on the lights at various intervals
because it would get so heated on the dance floor. There were multiple
reports of such conduct at dances all over the land. Some of the mothers
simply responded to such graphic scenes by saying something to the effect
of, "Well, they thought WE were obscene in our day, too." In other words,
even in the face of junior-high-school students publicly simulating
actions that are too shameful to mention in print, mothers are silent lest
they be mocked. Everyone is afraid of being called an old-fashioned prude.
They tremble, and cannot wait to be the first person to say, "There have
always been people who thought the sky was falling because of immorality!"

But now we are HERE. We are where the FUNDAMENTALISTS said we would be.
The mockers were WRONG. Homosexuals are on the television. There is nudity
on the screen. The average "moral" person vexes his soul, sighs, grabs the
popcorn and the remote control, and complains, "I wonder what will be
next?," as he snuggles up close to Sodom. You will certainly know you are
in the last days like Sodom, when people begin to embrace SODOMY!:

"Two [homosexual women] who recently moved to Dallas from Houston said
they were surprised by the MAYOR'S presence at the head of the [Dallas Gay
Pride] parade, followed by eight convertibles carrying council
members....'These times are a-changing. This is what we hoped for and we
worked for 25 years ago. It is extremely exciting and rewarding to see it
all happen,' said [homosexual activist] Young...." ("The Dallas Voice")

And then the picture begins to open up:

1. They will have no shame
2. They will accuse you of judging.
3. And now, we have seen, THEY WILL NOT TAKE PREACHERS SERIOUSLY!

Lot was a "preacher" because he proclaimed a warning: "Up, get you out of
this place; for the LORD will destroy this city!"

Let's review:

1. When society at large embraces homosexuality (and this happens to be at
the same time that reporters in New York are getting chip implants, and
chips are about to replace the bar code in all products, and Israel
happens to be a nation, and there happens to be a revival of sorcery, and
kids want to grow up to have a lightning bolt implanted on their forehead
and be a wizard)...
2. When people begin to accuse you of "judging" if you try to discriminate
between right and wrong...
3. When the majority of people will not take DIVINE WARNINGS seriously...

Then, you can be sure that you have arrived in the days our Lord was
warning us about! These days will continue into the tribulation period,
where they will reach a crescendo of immorality and destruction.

But we must not give up. We must seek to warn and win everyone we can. Lot
got two types of responses from his preaching. The first class accused him
of judging. The second class started LAUGHING. It is the same today. Most
will not take any warnings seriously. The preacher will be seen as one
that mocks. And in their laughter, they will MOCK back. The Bible agrees
that they will be MOCKERS in the last days:

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
SCOFFERS, walking after their own lusts,
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?

Jude 1:12 ...feeding themselves WITHOUT FEAR...
17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
18 How that they told you THERE SHOULD BE MOCKERS IN THE LAST TIME, who
should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

Proverbs 14:9 Fools make a mock at sin...

This teaches us that sin will be viewed as a JOKE. Everything is  a joke.
Everything is a cuss word. Sometimes you may wonder when you witness for
Jesus and warn sinners about the flames of Hell, how it can be that they
actually LAUGH! But you must remember that this is a generation whose
FATHERS grew up reveling and drinking to lyrics which made a mock of sin,
and mocked Hell, and mocked God!

The 50's and 60's "sexual liberation" generation soon produced a
generation which no longer felt the need to even defend its rebellion. It
began to MOCK HELL! Notice the lyrics that men in their 30's today were
listening to as teens:

"I live my life like there's no tomorrow...Runnin' with the devil...Ain't
got nobody waiting at home...Runnin' with the devil..." (1978, David Lee
Roth, of Van Halen)
 
"...they say it's kinda fright'nin' how this younger generation
swings...Well, the kid is into losin' sleep and he don't come home for
half the week....Yes, the cradle will rock. And I say, rock on!...he hits
the street...and he's unemployed....the cradle will rock. And I say, rock
on! Rock on!" (1980, David Lee Roth, of Van Halen)
 
ACDC sung "Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be" in 1977. They sung "Rock N' Roll
Damnation" in 1978. Notice these titles. They are telling. And then in
1979, ACDC struck it gold with:

"Don't need reason...party time, My friends are gonna be there too, I'm on
the highway to hell. Hey Satan, paid my dues...Hey Momma, look at me. I'm
on my way to the promised land." ("Highway to Hell," released July 27-30,
1979)

That is called mockery! Fools make a mock at sin! The album "Highway to
Hell" soon peaked at #8 on UK charts. By August 17th, 1979, the album was
#17 on U.S. Billboard charts. It was released as a single in the U.S. in
September of 1979. By October, 1979, coliseums were filling up IN THE
BIBLE BELT with 13,000 stoned kids, screaming, "I'm on Highway to Hell."
(Teens who were 16 in 1979 would be 40 today!) Thus, many children from
1-24 years of age today, HAVE PARENTS WHO GREW UP SCREAMING: "I'm on a
Highway to Hell!" And we sometimes wonder why 20 year olds mock when we
warn them about Hell!? We wonder why they laugh and shout "Satan rules!"
It's all a joke. The FATHERS of young adults today do not play, "splish
splash, I was taking a bath..." in the car stereo. They play, "Hey Satan,
paid my dues...Hey Momma, look at me. I'm on my way to the promised land!"
They do not listen to lyrics about stealing Daddy's car and taking it for
a drive; that is what the 60 year old GRANDFATHER listens to, to bring
back memories!

But let's get back to the mockery that developed in full bloom by 1980.
"Highway to Hell" becomes a gold album in October 1979. By January, 20,
1980, it is gold just about EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. But not even 30
days later, the mocking singer, Bon Scott, CHOKES TO DEATH ON HIS OWN
DRUNKEN VOMIT while sleeping in a car. He dies the night of February 18th,
1980 in London. He is pronounced dead on arrival at KING'S hospital the
next morning. He wakes up in HELL 30 days after he leads the world to mock
Hell with him. Most in the band remain stiff-necked with no fear of God.
Within a month they are recording, "Back in Black," where the new singer,
(who sounds much like Bon Scott), is demonically screaming, "I've been let
loose from the noose." And the FATHERS of the 20 year old men on the
street are daily listening to THIS Satanic MOCKERY of God's warnings,
judgments, and commands on their car stereo (to bring back memories). What
do you imagine the 20 year olds are listening to?

One day, these mockers will find fear. But it will be too late:

Proverbs 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of
my reproof:
26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I WILL MOCK WHEN YOUR FEAR COMETH;
29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled
with their own devices.

The mocking is not beyond the grave! There are judgments upon sin in this
life and after death. That is why the Bible calls the mocker a FOOL.

We are called to have the opposite attitude toward sin. We must not make a
mock of it. We must not mock God's warnings. God's people must have the
opposite attitude:

Ezekiel 9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
men that SIGH AND THAT CRY for all the abominations that be done in the
midst thereof.
5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the
city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:

We have seen what the 20's and 30's spawned in the 50's and 60's (a sexual
revolution). And we have seen what the 50's and 60's spawned in the 70's
and 80's (drugs, drop outs, irresponsibility, fornication, and a
MAINSTREAM mockery of God's awful warning about Hell). What did the 70's
and 80's spawn TODAY? You could guess. Notice a recent news report:

"Florida metal band 'Hell on Earth' will allow one of its fans to commit
suicide on stage....The fan is a terminally ill member of a pro-euthanasia
group. 'I support the right to die with dignity,' singer Billy Tourtelot
says. 'I got an email a few weeks ago from this person, who is a fan of
the band and who stated an interest in doing this.' In a press release
issued Monday the fan wrote: 'I thank the Lord that Hell on Earth is
giving me this opportunity to end my suffering.'" (Lifenews.com, Sept. 19,
2003)

"David Hundley, owner of the State Theater in St. Petersburg, said he is
not going to allow the concert to take place..."(Lifenews.com, Sept. 24,
2003)

"Due to the overwhelming response and in accordance with an oath,
bandleader, Billy Tourtelot gave to his terminally ill friend, the
show...will indeed take place at an undisclosed location in St. Petersburg
City limits. It will be broadcast live over the internet..."

When the earlier generations began blurring distinctions, and dancing
lewdly, this led to a sexual revolution as predicted by fundamentalists.
And what did their children grow up listening to?: a mockery of Hell and a
glorification of stupidity, and irresponsibility. And what did this spawn
for the next generation? "Gay Day" at the ballpark, amusement park, and
the local fair; a glorification of bi-sexuality in rock and pop lyrics.
And I can't even tell you from the pulpit what the "Fort Worth Star
Telegram" says is on TV this season. The actual glorification of suicide
by rock bands is old news. But now, we have the actual practice of it on
stage. This shows us that DEATH is now entertainment. We are racing back
to the Roman Circus. Shame on the Christians that justified the viewing of
GORY violence for entertainment. They are being infected and spoiled by
the world instead of being a light to it.

Let us review. Women (outside the church) began to cut their hair like
men, wear men's clothes, and show their legs and other body parts. The
fundamental Christians said it would lead to rampant sexual promiscuity in
the next generation, and that future generations would not simply
cross-dress, they would embrace homosexuality. They were mocked. They were
told that they should not be so extreme. They were told that people have
always said the sky was falling. They said the situation with the fall of
Rome was different than America. America has "too much to do" to ever grow
effeminate and soft, and be taken over by savage invaders. The
fundamentalists then preached that within a few generations, society would
embrace the same abominations for which God judged the Canaanites. Those
nations were guilty of, not only cross-dressing, but they cut themselves,
and committed homosexual acts, necromancy, and even BESTIALITY:

Leviticus 18:23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down
thereto: it is confusion.
24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the
nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
25 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon
it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

The same rock band, "Hell on Earth" reportedly commits bestiality on
stage. Is there a moral decline? Elvis the Pelvis was soon no longer
shocking. The world needed men to dress as women and wear make-up and
lipstick. Before long this was not shocking. The world needed a mockery of
Hell and a glorification of Satanism. And before long, this was no longer
shocking. They must see Satanic transvestites named after murderers. And
finally, they must see an actual suicide. They must see bestiality
committed on stage.

Therefore, we went from slit skirts and cross-dressing in the 1920's to
sodomy and bestiality in 2003. That is about one lifetime.

How should we respond? God tells us:

Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall
find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.
17 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the
trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

As God raises up watchmen to blow the trumpet and awaken those who are
SLUMBERING IN SODOM, will YOU repent? Let's bow the knee to God right now
and tell Him that we are sorry. Let's lead our homes out of Sodom. Let's
quit justifying sin.

================================================================
Dan Corner of "Evangelical Outreach" has written a giant work on the
subject of losing salvation and has debated Dave Hunt and others on the
subject. We were arranging the final details for a debate, when he sent an
e-mail trying to get me to agree not to bring up the King James Bible
issue. I agreed to keep on the subject as much as possible, but said that
there is no way I could allow him to quote whatever he wanted to quote for
whatever verse, and NOT debate whether the translation he is reading is
Scripture. Would HE be willing not to bring up the "new translation
issue"? How ridiculous. He then backed out of the debate. By doing so, he
admitted that he could not prove a loss of eternal salvation from a KING
JAMES BIBLE. He knows he could, however, make a partial case for his views
by using the Catholic manuscripts (since Rome teaches unconditional
security). One of his pet manuscripts was found in a Catholic monastery,
and the other was found in the Vatican library. Yet, I do not think he
could win a debate (since his view is wrong), even with quoting whatever
he wants, whenever he wants. I had no problem with him doing so. And I
would have avoided getting off the subject. But who in their right mind is
going to say, "Yes, I will accept whatever you quote as inspired
Scripture."
===============================================================

Gay Day at the Texas State Fair will be on Sunday, October 5th. Why not
join us outside the fair after church to warn families and testify that
sodomy is sin? One young, fair-ground worker told me that the homosexuals
continually try to proposition him when they come out. Visit:

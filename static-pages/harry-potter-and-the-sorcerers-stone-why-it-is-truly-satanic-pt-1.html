HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE: WHY IT IS TRULY SATANIC (Pt.1) 

INTRODUCTION 

"The Initiates in a particular [occult] science, having been instructed by fables, enigmas, ALLEGORIES, and hieroglyphics, wrote mysteriously whenever in their works they touched the subject of the Mysteries, and continued to CONCEAL [occult] science under the veil of FICTIONS...When the destruction by Cambyses of many cities, and the ruin of nearly all Egypt...dispersed most of the Priests into Greece and elsewhere, they bore with them their [occult] sciences, which they continued to teach enigmatically, that is to say, ever enveloped in the obscurities of FABLES and hieroglyphics; to the end that the vulgar herd, seeing, might see nothing..." (Albert Pike, "Morals and Dogma," p.365) 

There it is as plain as it can be written. Occultists use fiction to separate the true seekers from the common "herd." This article (and particulary the second part next week) will prove that Harry Potter is truly Satanic. Although I have tried to make sure there is nothing crude or profane in this article, it is written and intended for adults only. This is an in-depth review (primarily) of J.K. Rowling's first Potter book, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" (1999) from a Biblical perspective. It is divided into sections. Christians reading and defending Harry Potter books (Chuck Colson, etc.) are part of the "falling away" predicted for these last days (2 Thess.2:3, 1 Tim.4:1). This article will explain why. I pray many will be convinced and turn from this deception. Part two of this study will deal with the deep occult themes and symbolism used by Rowling that is meant for the "seekers" and "initiates." Rowling is more than familiar with Balvatsky, Pike and Crowley. Her Potter books are abundantly laced with pure occultism. Rowling is not a naive author who simply wrote a best-selling fantasy. She is part of a larger movement that is helping to bring in the New Age "messiah." 

WHO ARE THE REAL SIMPLETONS? 

Not too long ago an article from "The Onion" flooded e-mail mailboxes. The story contained a subtle mixture of truth and error. It used false numbers and false quotes to turn Rowling into an outright Satanist. Some Christians (who think they have Biblical discernment because they regularly visit the various web sites that expose "urban legends") have pointed out that the article is a hoax. Most Christians have seen only a portion of the article. It was very blasphemous (to the point of absurdity, using pornographic language). The people that started the "urban legend" did it to mock Christians, knowing that they already viewed Harry Potter as dangerous. The Kingdom Alert Update never quoted any of this article, since there were no 
true sources that could be verified. Nevertheless, I have written many reports in the past that prove that the main thesis of the spoof is actually correct. So who are the real simpletons? I do not think they are the ones who believed that this urban legend was true. These simply need to be more careful. The people that have the biggest problem are the ones that were TRICKED by this propaganda. The Devil raises up the Harry Potter books to take kids one more step toward accepting the future Antichrist. The first Potter book contains its own defense against the fundamentalist outcry. It paints fundamentalists as stupid and paranoid. Therefore, anyone who reads the book and enjoys it is brainwashed into seeing the fundamentalist attack on the book as an exercise in "absurdity." But then, not satisfied with this one defense, an e-mail "suddenly" makes its appearance in thousands of computers WORLDWIDE which claims that Rowling practically admits (openly) that she is a Satanist. [This would not have been financially or 
strategically prudent. It is witchcraft that the Devil is making acceptable in the mainstream at the moment - not raw Satanism.] Many Christians then took the bait and spread it around further. Then, when the truth comes out that it is a myth, the Christians who were before UNDECIDED now jump to the other side and declare that they are smart for not being deceived. But in reality THIS final result was the main goal of the deception! Wake up Christians! The fact that the e-mail was fake does not mean Harry Potter is not Satanic and dangerous. This article will prove that Harry Potter is Wiccan, Satanic (i.e. A. Crowley), and Masonic (therefore New Age in general) PROPAGANDA! We will begin this week with some, basic practical problems to prove this assertion. 


HARRY POTTER TEACHES CHILDREN TO BE REBELLIOUS 

The Bible predicts that children will be disobedient in the last days: 

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall come. 
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, DISOBEDIENT TO PARENTS, unthankful, unholy, 

The Bible says that rebellion can be as bad as witchcraft itself: 

1 Samuel 15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft... 

Rowling's first Potter book is marketed to children age 8-13. The type and graphics are designed for this age group. When confronted with the violence, rebellion, etc. in the book, Rowling answers that she did not write the book for children! No one ever asks her anymore questions. A child cannot read "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" (from this point on referred to as "HPSS") without identifying with Harry Potter as a hero or role model. There is also a female character (a young witch named Hermione Granger) in the story so young girls can find additional identification. But putting aside the sorcery and witchcraft for a moment, are Harry Potter and Hermione Granger good role models? Are there good role models ANYWHERE in the book? The answer is absolutely no. Children (even the good characters) lie, call names, hate, go on adventures in bathrobes in mixed company at 11 years old, steal (p.227), and break rules in general. 

Before providing some examples, a brief summary of the story line might be helpful. Harry Potter's parents were famous witches. They are killed by a bad (dark) wizard. Yet, the murderous spell doesn't work against the infant Potter. All it does is leave a lightning shaped cut in his forehead. The orphan Potter is laid by witches at the doorstep of his aunt and uncle (the Durselys) to be raised. This couple opposes witchcraft as dangerous, and for that reason they have separated from Potter's family. Having no real choice, they raise the child. Rowling paints this couple in the worst light imaginable. The first part 
of the book deals with Harry's life, growing up in this home. When Harry is eleven, a wizard rescues him to go to a famous school for witches and wizards. The rest of the book consists of Harry's adventures at this school. 

The first authority figures that Harry has are the Durselys. Harry has not known any other father other than his uncle Vernon Dursely. When a letter arrives from the school of witchcraft, Uncle Vernon refuses to let Harry have the letter. Notice how Harry responds: 

"'I want to read that letter,' said Harry furiously, 'as it's mine.' 'Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon... Harry didn't move. 'I WANT MY LETTER!' he shouted." (p.35) 

Later, when Harry is in the school, he responds to an exciting circumstance by stating an obscenity: 

"What the ----?" (p.115) 

There is indeed a blank after the "the" in the book. But what else could follow such words but an obscenity? This is a common phrase for street obscenities. Do we find the role models in older fictional works for children expressing such language and rebellion? Certainly not. 

The next authority figures for Harry and the other children are school teachers. Harry and his friends are irritated that Hermione Granger follows rules and doesn't lie to authorities. But later, she learns to disobey authority and lie, and by doing so, she then wins acceptance!: 

"Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?... Hermione had become a bit more relaxe about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her...and she was much nicer for it... She had conjured them up a bright blue fire...Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed." (pp.177, 181) 

The book is filled with mean, hateful statements, name calling, etc. that no obedient Christian parent would ever allow in his or her children: 

"'Wonder what's wrong with his [the teacher's] leg?' 'Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him, said Ron bitterly." (p.182) 

"I hate them both,' said Harry, 'Malfoy and Snape." (p.196) 

"Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid..." (p.31) 

And the hatred is not confined to the little boys. Hermione certainly learns how to be a "little witch": 

"Oh, shut up,' said Hermione,..." (p. 269) 

She later lies to a school mate and inflicts a paralyzing horror upon him - just because he is "in the way": 

"You're going out again,' he said. 'No, no, no,' said Hermione. 'No we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?' [lying]...She raised her wand. 'Petrificus Totalus!' she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.... Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror." (p.272) 

That's pretty sick stuff. I would not have even printed the trash if I didn't think some adult Christians needed to see what they are allowing their children to read. Is it okay for a little girl to disobey teachers, lie and then bring "horror" upon a school mate? Yet, I suppose that most of the parents in the world who let their children read Rowling's Harry Potter are themselves reading Stephen King. 

Harry Potter ends the book with a plan to continue to defy, not only his non-magic step-parents, but also his school officials: 

"They don't know we're not supposed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer..." (p.309) 


HARRY POTTER TEACHES CHILDREN TO BE CRUDE 

The new philosophy in Hollywood, Disney, etc. is to lace movies with crude humor that worldly children would respond to, while also inserting so-called "adult" humor. Under this new system, there is a larger market. This is clearly the approach that Rowling has used for her book. The book contains references to vomit and other crude bodily substances in an attempt to be humorous to young children: 

"I was unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one..." (p.300) [see also pp.104, 177] 

How then, can it be true that the book is not designed for children? 

HARRY POTTER TEACHES CHILDREN TO USE PROFANITY AND BLASPHEME GOD 

We have already mentioned Harry Potter's implied profanity (p.115). But the book (HPSS) goes further and actually contains the Biblical word "damn" used as a cuss word (p.41)! There are also at least five places where the Lord or Heaven (as the place of His throne) are used in vain, as a type of exclamation or profanity. Since I consider this to be blasphemy, I will only provide the page numbers where these expressions occur (pp.12, 23, 69,152, 290). Some of these statements are from witches and wizards. Prayer (communion with the Holy God) is also used in vain: 

"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it." (p.174) 

Do witches and wizards pray? Why do they appeal to the "good Lord" (while serving whiskey from a bar)? Of course, witches and wizards worship the horned god and the goddess. Perhaps these references are meant to apply to them. 

On the other hand, they might also be used to make people with Christian backgrounds, who are feeling a bit uneasy at all the witchcraft, feel at home. (However, if blasphemy makes you feel at home, you have some problems.) There are also references in the book to witches celebrating Christmas and Easter (pp.196, 229). The early Goths celebrated the Yule feast (which afterward became Christmas) to honor all the new occult "initiates." These holidays (stripped from any Christian references) have a large history in pagan religion (i.e. witchcraft, etc.). Herod (as a pagan) makes reference to Easter (Acts 12:4). My purpose is not to enter into the debate of whether or not Christians should honor the birth or resurrection of our Saviour on these days. It is to warn naive Christians not to be deceived into thinking that this Wiccan propaganda (HPSS) is somehow benign because it uses references to the Lord, Heaven, Christmas and Easter! An 
Episcopalian web site (www.episcopalchurch.org) contains a debate between mothers on the subject of Harry Potter. A little girl wrote in and her response summed up the problem with these books in a nutshell: 

"This is my view on how Harry Potter affects my faith in God: It doesn't. If anything, it has made me closer to God with a better understanding about different peoples around the world. The reasons are as follows: One, in the Harry Potter books they celebrate both Christmas and Easter; two, never in reading all four of the books four times has there been any mention of Satanism. Yes there is witchcraft, but it is mostly good witchcraft...As an Episcopalian, I think that Harry Potter has made me more aware of a superior power that watches us..." 
(T.G., Grade 8, Madison, Wis.) 

This dear little girl (like many good Baptist kids) is being deceived into thinking that there is a "good witchcraft," and that this is okay as along as it is not Satanism! Rowling's references to Christmas presents, Christmas trees, Easter vacation, prayer, the Lord's name and throne, etc. has deceived people into thinking the book is somehow "wholesome." This makes the book all the more Satanic: 

2 Corinthians 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 

HARRY POTTER MOCKS SEPARATED, FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIANS 

In the book, Potter's aunt and uncle (the Durselys) are belittled as "Muggles." "Muggle" is partly defined later in the book: 

"'A Muggle,' said Hagrid, 'it's what we call nonmagic folk like them.'" (p.53) 

Yet, it is clear that by "Muggle" Rowling does not just mean people who cannot exercise magic. She means anyone who believes it is dangerous or morally wrong to practice magic! People who think this is all fantasy need to splash some cold water on their faces. In the world today there ARE people who call themselves witches and wizards (i.e. Wiccans, etc.). And there are people who think they are morally wrong (fundamental Christians)! So we are clearly NOT in the realm of fantasy at all. we are in the realm of PROPAGANDA aimed at CHILDREN! 

Children will go to public school and learn about nature religion, paganism, eastern religion and Wicca. This will appear EXCITING. They will then go home and be warned by parents (an older generation) who will not approve of these things (these parents are shocked because they thought public school would be the same as when they attended). These parents will be seen as "Muggles" to children indoctrinated with Harry Potter at school. This is Marilyn Ferguson's dream come true ("The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in Our Time", 1976). Notice some quotes from HPSS in regard to Muggles: 

"...in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she did not have a sister, because her sister and her goof-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be...The Durselys knew that the Potters had a small son, too...This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that." (p.2) 

"Well, I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with... you know...her crowd." (p.7) 

"...there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursely couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes - the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion...his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by...these people were obviously collecting for something..." (p.3) 

"While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia...This morning, it was motorcycles...'roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,' he said, as a motorcycle overtook them." (p.25) 

"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?" (p.36) 

"I was the only one who saw her for what she really was - a freak! But for my mother and father...they were proud of having a witch in the family!'" (p.53) 

Fundamental Christians are commanded to practice separation (2 Cor.6:14-18). They teach their children not to mix with children who practice witchcraft, dress in black trench coats, listen to bad music, etc. Fundamental Christians are opposed to crossdressing, perversion, and immodest clothing (1 Tim.2:9).We think that Wiccans are involved in a Satanic religion and that "Moonies" are in a cult and that they need to hear the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. Is it not obvious that Rowling is calling fundamentalists "Muggles"? "Muggles" are shown to be unhappy people: 

"Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!" (p.5) 

Anyone who has been street witnessing to young adults practicing Wicca, etc. knows that they believe fundamental Christians are unhappy people. Rowling goes further and calls us "stupid" for believing witchcraft is of the Devil. She paints the Muggles as stupid, overweight gluttons, afraid of what they do not understand: 

"Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something." (p. 10) 

"Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do." (p.59) 

Her book attempts to make children hate the Muggles. If you are still not convinced that Rowling is writing against fundamental Christians, notice the following quotes: 

"Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut..." (p.20) 

"Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs..." (p.24) 

"'You could just leave me here,' Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change..." (p.23) 

"Mrs. Figg wasn't as bad as usual...She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake..." (p.32) 

Now I ask: what group of people thinks witchcraft is dangerous and evil, separates from witches, does not allow their children to play with witches, is opposed to new fashions in dress, teaches that growing boys and men should have short hair, and opposes certain television programs? (Actually some of us are opposed to ALL worldly TV in general, and think we would not have to write articles such as this if more Christians threw the TV and worldly movies away for good.) There is only ONE significant group of people such as this. Therefore, Muggles represent born-again, fundamental Christians. The world always teaches that fundamentalists are hypocrites. 

And even if someone is stubborn or naive enough to think that Rowling does not have fundamentalists in mind, what will children learn from this fiction? Will they not learn to despise anyone who resists the New Age movement? 

Rowling has laced her book with its own defenses. Knowing that she would be reproved by fundamentalists for taking her fiction "666 steps" deeper into the occult than C.S. Lewis or Tolkien, she created the Muggles to mock their response. Notice that Muggles are REALLY opposed to imagination: 

"He was rattled...hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination." (p.5) 

Therefore Rowling continues to pretend that her book is not Wiccan, New Age propaganda, and that she did not write for children. She pretends it is only fiction and that anyone opposed to it doesn't "approve of imagination." Yet, we have learned from her main characters that Rowling believes it is okay to inflict horrible suffering on others, disobey authorities, and LIE if it helps "the cause"! Therefore, discerning, Christian fundamentalists will take her statements "cum grano salis" (i.e. with a grain of salt!). 


HARRY POTTER TEACHES THAT "MODERATE" DRINKING IS OKAY 

"He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses..." (p. 17) 

"Everyone [in the bar] seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, 'The usual, Hagrid?' 'Can't Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,' said Hagrid." (p.68, 69) [Hagrid later renounces his drinking for giving away an important secret while drunk - yet, with all the references in the book, we are forced to believe it is because he "abuses" it.] "Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing professor McGonald on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table..." (p.204) 

There is no place where Mrs. McGonald renounces wine; children are left to believe that it is perfectly acceptable for fermented wine to be served at the table of a school of 11 year old children! They are also left to believe that it is acceptable for a school teacher to get tipsy and "loose". But Holy Scripture teaches children not to so much as LOOK at fermented wine (Pr.23:31). 


HARRY POTTER TEACHES CHILDREN THAT THERE IS GOOD WITCHCRAFT 

"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindlewald in 1945..." (p.219) 

"See, there was this wizard who went...bad." (p.54) 

But Scripture condemns ALL witchcraft as EVIL: 

Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 
20 Idolatry, WITCHCRAFT, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 

I have already quoted the little Episcopalian girl who summed up the impression most children will receive from reading Harry Potter: "Yes there is witchcraft, but it is mostly good witchcraft..." This is the very teaching that true witchcraft (as an official religion) wishes to convey to people. They will be temporarily successful. The Bible predicts that the whole world will be filled with sorcerers when this present generation begins to grow older: 

Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their SORCERIES, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 

HARRY POTTER REFERS TO REAL WITCHES AND REAL WITCHCRAFT IN THE MIDST OF ITS FICTION 

Perhaps those who still use the "It's just fantasy" excuse will be convinced with what follows. Just as some modern kids collect cards with sports players, the witch kids in the book collect cards with pictures of famous witches and wizards. Is this just innocent fiction? That depends. Is witchcraft a REAL religion out there? Are there web sites that present witchcraft as a real alternative to Christianity? If so, then the Harry Potter books must be seen as Wiccan propaganda. The witches are not presented as evil creatures (as in fairy tales). The witches are the HEROES of the book. When a child in earlier days read about Daniel Boone, he wanted to go explore the woods and fight with a dangerous bear. Certainly such books had their own dangers. But there were no widespread Daniel Boone cults that presented themselves as an alternative to Christianity. When "Evel Knieval" was the big craze, all the young boys in America began jumping ramps with their bikes, and many indeed broke their legs, if not their necks. When children read Superman comics, they wanted to pretend they were Superman. But there was no cult out there called "the Superman cult" that presented itself as an 
alternative to Christianity! What will children who read about Harry Potter want to do? They will want to pretend they are witches and wizards. But wait one second: there ARE hundreds of web sites out there that advocate true witchcraft! And they DO present themselves as an alternative to fundamental Christianity. 

But someone objects by saying that the witches in the Potter books are fictitious. I do not see how this is any objection. But instead of worrying about that, it is important to point out that Rowling presents REAL WITCHES as heroes in the context of fictitious ones!: 

"Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect - famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred....Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengis of Woodcroft, Alberic, Grunnion, Circe, PARACELSUS, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose..." (pp.102, 103) 

Cliodna was the daughter of a High Druid. Circe was a sorceress in Greek mythology who turned people into swine. Yet, Paracelsus (1493-1541) is a REAL hero of modern day witches and wizards! He was an ALCHEMIST (i.e. sorcerer). Albert Pike (Mason) wrote in his "Morals and Dogma" (1950, 1871): 

"The Hermetic Art is, therefore, at the same time a religion, a philosophy, and a natural science...we must inquire for its processes of Paracelsus [and] Nicholas Flamel..." (p.774) 

Pike attempts to take his initiates into the mysteries of TRUE OCCULTISM. He lists two heroes who "held the torch" of this mystery religion in the middle ages. One of these is Paracelsus, who shows up on a trading card as a model hero for Rowling's young readers! So it's all just fantasy? no children will go to their library and explore the life and writings of Paracelsus? But Rowling is not through. Pike also mentions Nicholas Flamel as a Masonic (occult) hero. Rowling therefore actually brings this old sorcerer into her story line!: 

"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindlewald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, NICOLAS FLAMEL'!...'Nicolas Flamel,' she whispered dramatically, 'is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's stone!'...She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone...the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist...Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life..." (pp. 219, 220) 

This is not exactly fiction! This man was a real sorcerer, showing up in occult works such as "Morals and Dogma." He is truly known as a man who made the Philosopher's Stone (to be explained later). In a work attributed to Flamel, he writes: 

"I Nicholas Flamel, a scrivener of Paris, in the year 1414, in the reign of our gracious Prince Charles the VIth, whom God preserve; and after the death of my faithful partner PERENELLE, am seized with a desire and a delight, in remembrance of her, and in your behalf, dear nephew, to write out the whole magistery of the secret of the Powder of Projection, or the Philosophical Tincture, which God hath willed to impart to his very insignificant servant, and which I have found out, as thou also wilt find out in working as I shall declare unto you." 
("Testament of Nicholas Flamel", London: 1806) 

Rowling also mentions Flamel's wife in the book: 

"'But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?'... Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face. 'To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure." (p.297) 

Occult books and web sites discuss Flamel as the most famous of fourteenth century "adepts." Around 1361 Flamel found an occult book called "The Sacred Book of Abraham the Jew, Priest, Levite, Astrologer and Philosopher to that Tribe of Jews who by the Wrath of God were Dispersed amongst the Gauls." On a trip to Spain in 1382, Flamel supposedly met a Jew who explained the "mysteries" of this text to him. He returned to Paris with the alchemist keys. He did become very wealthy. Occult encyclopedias state that legend teaches that he and his wife faked their deaths and are still living. 

Flamel is seen by occultists as a hero who knew how to "handle" the secret wisdom without greed and lust. Rowling closes the first Potter book with this lesson. Harry learns from the master wizard that finding the "stone" is not simply about money and immortality. This sounds good to many Christians. They think it is a wonderful moral story. But this is PURE occultism. It is fantasy and fiction only as much as true occultism is fantasy! But the Devil is real. His lies are therefore nothing to play around with. 

Notice that Rowling states that Flamel was 665 years old LAST YEAR. He later graciously submits to death when the Sorcerer's Stone is destroyed. Therefore, Rowling has presented true occultists with much meat to chew on in the midst of her fiction. She has Flamel die when he is 666 years old! [His death is a little too close to suicide to be harmless for children. Rowling presents death as just the "next great adventure" - p.297] 

Rowling presents true New Age heroes in other, more subtle ways. The powerful, famous "good" wizard of the story is Dumbledore. His loyal pet is named FAWKES. Guy Fawkes (1570-1606) was the Roman Catholic that is famous for the Gunpowder Plot. On the night of November 4-5, 1605, he was caught in the cellar underneath the House of Lords. He was arrested and hanged for conspiracy to blow up the English Parliament. This was really Satan's attempt to stop the Authorized Version from finding its way into the hands of the common people. To this day, every book on witchcraft, astrology, new age religion, etc. hates that one Book more than any other. The reason is that it is blunt in denouncing astrology, etc. Witches and astrologers find it easier to justify themselves with new versions (according to their own admissions - see "The Four Horsemen" by Elizabeth Clare Prophet, etc.). "Fawkes" becomes a name for a LOYAL pet in Harry Potter. Rowling's point is ominous. Perhaps this is one of many reasons that Catholics love the Harry Potter: 

"Harry Potter is great, says Catholic group - Harry Potter, the young wizard-in-training whose adventures top best-seller lists but have been denounced by conservative religious groups, has won a vote of approval from the Roman Catholic Opus Dei association...The three books published so far have sold 30 million copies worldwide, and the next book in the series, due in July, is expected to be just as popular. But conservative religious groups in the United States and England have attacked the books for glorifying the occult powers that Harry Potter and his friends are learning to use at a school for wizards. Opus Dei is an association mainly of Catholic laity who take strict vows to promote holiness and exercise a personal apostolate in their daily lives."

Another fictional book mentioned by Rowling in one of the Potter books is "Unfogging the Future". This was the "divination text" at the Hogwarts school. It is said to be authored by "Cassandra Vablatsky." It is obvious where this name comes from. In "The Magical World of Harry Potter" by David Colbert, Colbert reveals that it stands for "Blavatsky". Colbert writes: 

"Rowling stuffs an entire classical education into each of her books..." (BTW) 

Yes. Too bad it is an education (or better yet "initiation") into true OCCULTISM! Harry Potter's initials are "H.P." These are the same initials of Blavatsky's name as it is normally written. H. P. Blavatsky (1831-1891) was the founder of an occult society and movement called Theosophy. She was a spiritist and founder of the New Age movement. She also "bobbed" hair two generations before any other women dared to do so (1 Cor.11). She was known by her closest associates for lying in order to spread the occult "truth." Therefore, one must realize that true occultists cannot be trusted. What are we to think of Rowling if these types of people are the heroes of her story? These people (such as Blavatsky) are real and dangerous. At the end of the book, the "good" wizard tells Harry that the stone is not really important. Blavatsky (in real life) explains why when she writes: "Man is the philosopher's stone spiritually." 

Other characters in Rowling's books borrow names from Celtic goddesses, etc. Her books are indeed an "education" in New Age occultism! 


HARRY POTTER GLORIFIES SERPENTS AND DRAGONS LIKE TRUE OCCULTISTS 

"After lunch they went to the reptile house...Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place...Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake...The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked...'Where do you come from, anyway' Harry asked." (p.27) 

"...I'd like a dragon...Wanted one ever since I was a kid..." (p.65) 

On the front cover of the book (HPSS), serpents are entwined around the two pillars at the entrance of the "HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY." 

In the occult religions, serpents are seen as wise. Pike writes: 

"Of Hermes, the Mercury of the Greeks, the Thoth of the Egyptians, and the Taaut of the Phoenicians, we have heretofore spoken sufficiently at length. He was the inventor of letters and Oratory, the winged messenger of the Gods, bearing the Caduceus wreathed with serpents..." ("Morals and Dogma," p.586)

Thus, the Masonic, occult god of secret wisdom carries a wand entwined with serpents. In his index, Pike writes: 

"[Serpents are]...an emblem of eternity and immortality... Serpents and Dragons have somehing divine in their nature" (p.168, Digest) 

Genesis 3 reveals Satan in the form of a serpent to deceive mankind. The Book of Revelation calls the Devil a Dragon and a Serpent: 

Revelation 12:9 And the great DRAGON was cast out, that old SERPENT, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 

The only people that can logically see Harry Potter books as harmless fiction are the same people that believe the DEVIL HIMSELF is only harmless fiction. 

The password to the school is "the head of the serpent": 

"'Password?' She said. 'Caput Draconis,' said Percy..." (p.129) 

HARRY POTTER ENTICES CHILDREN TO STUDY REAL OCCULT BOOKS 

Throughout this book, references are made to courses at the school that are REAL subjects of study among true witches. One review on the opening page of the book is truer than it probably realizes: 

"After reading this entrancing fantasy, readers will be convinced that they, too, could take the train to Hogwarts School..." (School Library Journal) 

The book lists the course books that Harry and the other wizards will need for school: 

"First year student will require...Three sets of plain work robes (black)... All students should have a copy of each of the following: 'The Standard Book of Spells' (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk, 'A History of Magic' by Bathilda Bagshot, 'Magical Theory' by Adalbert Waffling, 'A Beginners' Guide to Transfiguration' by Emeric Switch, 'One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi' by Phyllida Spore, 'Magical Drafts and Potions' by Arsenius Jigger, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' by Newt Scamander, 'The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection' by Quentin Trimble." (pp.66, 67) 

While the authors of these books are not real people, the book names are right out of occult bookstores (and new age sections in popular bookstore chains)! Similar titles can now be found in school libraries across the world. Notice the true titles of some random occult books that any 12 year old can find, purchase, or check out with ease: 

"Basic Magic Spells" 
"A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans" 
"The Complete Book of Incense, Oils & Brews" 
"Book of Spells" 
"True Magick: A Beginner's Guide" 
"The Complete Book of Spells, Ceremonies and Magic" 

Therefore, how can people say this is all "harmless" fantasy when these REAL books are readily available to children? Rowling makes sure she comforts the children who are mostly unfamiliar with true witchcraft: 

"There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quickly enough." (p.100) 

The main character, Harry is told to relax. Children will glean that just because their parents are Christians it is no bar to exploring witchcraft! 

Someone objects by saying that wands and spells are not TRUE witchcraft. Yet these things ARE present in true witchcraft! Furthermore, Rowling goes far to teach children that witchcraft is serious and much larger than FANTASY: 

"There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes...Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology..." (p.133) 

"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron..." (p.137) 

HARRY POTTER HAS HELPED MAINSTREAM THE OCCULT REVIVAL 

A true, practicing witch writes: 

"Thanks in part to the popularity of the Harry Potter books and to television shows such as 'Charmed' and 'Sabrina, The Teenage Witch'; everyone in America knows what a spell is." (Wren Walker, "Hidden hatred Haunts Pagans" from "The Witches Voice." March 12, 2000) 

Another real witch writes: 

"Alas, these days it seems like there are far more earnestly curious teens than there are old witches in cottages...In the past ten years, I have been witnessing a rise in structured "Wicca 101" classes at alternative schools and through magick shops all over my region. While a one-on-one relationship is ideal, there simply aren't enough heroic Wiccan pioneers out there willing or qualified to do it. That's why I believe having a Sunday School for Witches type of thing might be the best way for us to teach our curious teens about our religion. Now that I am older, my fantasy about the witch in the cottage has changed to a fantasy about a college for Witches. I dream of being able to afford an old convent in the woods somewhere that I could use to set up my UOW (University of Wicca). There would be dorms and scholarships and varying 
degrees bestowed on its students. There would be all levels of study, from basic to very deep. I have even written curriculum, course schedules, and a list of my ideal professors from all over the world. My fantasy is a utopia of metaphysical and historical education more varied and in depth than anyone would get from one teacher. I've had this fantasy since before the Harry Potter books came out, so you can imagine my delight when I read of "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry" which is basically an over-the-top, whimsical fiction of my dream. Imagination is the first step to actualization, so it thrills me that children are reading these books. Someday, perhaps there'll be a "Henbane's School of Witchcraft and Magick." (Henbane, a California witch, Witchvox.com) 

Notice that she says that "imagination is the first step to actualization" and that she is "thrilled" that children are reading these books! She is saddened that there are not enough trained witches to handle the interest! 

This new interest among children is relatively recent. Linda P. Harvey in "Heresy in the Hood" writes: 

"'Witchcraft is the fastest-growing religion in America today,' said a proponent recently on the teen-popular 'E'-cable channel, and interest is high among adolescent girls, since wiccans are 'strong, self-directed women.' The fascination with witchcraft among the young is a new twist. As recently as 1993, Cynthia Eller noted in her admiring book on feminist spirituality (witchcraft), '...how few women [in feminist spirituality] there are below thirty....There are women in their teens and twenties, but not many.' That has changed...there are the top-selling Harry Potter books by J.K Rowling, which adults as well as kids are gobbling up...Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's 
Stone is not simply a children's book, but number 2 in sales at amazon.com. So, teens come to the throne of adolescent self-indulgence and rebellion ready to pick up the sorcerer's wand to satisfy morbid curiosity and possibly wave away their troubles." 

The following news report does not deal specifically with Harry Potter, but it does show that books such as Harry Potter are part of a very SERIOUS revival of occultism: 

"Wicca Casts Spell on Teen-Age Girls - In their universal quest for self-actualization, a devilish number of teen-age girls have become enchanted by the female-friendly but retrograde culture of Witchcraft. 'Teen Witch: Wicca for a New Generation', a recent book by Silver Ravenwolf, has sold more copies for occult publisher Llewellyn than any other in its 95-year history, according to publicist Jamie Schumacher. And it's not just media hype, either. Danny Aguirre runs a Christian hot line at the Berkeley, Calif.-based Spiritual Counterfeits Project. He says, 'In the last six months, I have received more inquiries about Wicca than any other religion in the 10 years I have worked here.' The demographics of the callers? 'All teen-age girls,' says Aguirre...Demographics of Wiccans in the United States are difficult to find. There is much to-do about secrecy, and groups do not release membership rolls...According to 
Goddess Unmasked author Davis, 'The problem is that this younger generation has grown up with magic and the occult. Their cartoons feature ghosts and monsters, they have the Internet Websites and prime-time TV is Buffy and Sabrina. All this stuff makes Wicca seem natural to them.' Not surprisingly, the teen magazines have jumped on the Wiccan bandwagon as well. A recent issue of Young and Modern magazine features two pages on Witchcraft with the banner headline, 'Witchy Ways!'..." (Catherine Edwards, Insight Magazine) 

A recent report in WND reads: 

"Potter books: Wicked witchcraft? New documentary claims tales lead kids to the occult - ...an occult expert has released a documentary video claiming the Harry Potter phenomenon is incompatibility with Christianity...with the first of several feature-film adaptations of the children's story set to open on Nov. 16, Harry Potter fever has started heating up again...critics object to the use of witchcraft and wizardry in fighting evil, not to mention the book's graphic depictions of evil. Even the good wizards in Harry's world cause eyebrows to be raised in many circles... 'Through Harry Potter books and audios, children as young as kindergarten age are being introduced to human sacrifice, the sucking of blood from dead animals and possession by spirit beings,' the video states...Many parents, regardless of their faith, may not wish to have their children read about evil non-physical beings who 
drink the blood of animals to gain power. But the books are marketed to children ages 9-12. For Christians in particular, the acclamation given Harry Potter's world is seen as unbiblical...The video documentary details numerous similarities between the spells and magic used by Harry Potter and those used in the witchcraft of the Wiccan religion. Such striking similarity, said Matrisciana, is evidence that the author has meticulously researched Wicca and included its tenets in her children's books. 'My greatest concern is that godly fear that protects mankind from dabbling in the spirit world is being taken away from children who read these Harry Potter books. The terrors and horrors of black magic and occult practice, rituals, ceremonies and demon possession are being normalized,' she said. "Alarmingly, the Potter books are engaging in pagan discipleship, disciplining our children to spiritual alternatives and also turning them away from the biblical principles and God's protection.' The books' publisher, Scholastic, encourages teachers to read the books aloud in class and provides discussion guides for teachers and parents... Matrisciana thinks introduction of the Harry Potter books into the classroom as a springboard for curriculum is unacceptable..." (Julie Foster, 2001, WND)

Perhaps the next news reports will wake up some Christians: 

"On 27 April Scotland Yard announced that it would use the services of a professional magician to train chief superintendents in the skills of communication and networking...Outside the workplace, the Harry Potter series of adult-read children's books has helped fuel a revival of British interest in the occult. The British Satanist Aleister Crowley and his growing band of disciples were recently featured in a television documentary on witchcraft as a kind of lifestyle choice. But inside the workplace, too, the acquisition of magical powers is now taken seriously..." (May 9, 2001, James Woudhuysen, Spiked-Online) 

"Teenage witches: Bell, books and candle -Three hundred years ago, witches were hanged or burned at the stake. Today, witchcraft is celebrated as a hot teen trend in movies and television shows such as 'The Craft,' 'Charmed' and 'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.' Now, book publishers are hoping to cash in on this fascination, fanned by the record sales of the series featuring a boy wizard named Harry Potter. In recent months, four publishers have launched new paperback fiction series centered on teenage girls' involvement in witchcraft. Three series are written for teenagers: the 'Sweep' series by Cate Tiernan, published by Penguin Putnam; 'Circle of Three' by Isobel Bird, published by Avon; and 'Daughters of the Moon' by Lynne Ewing, published by Volo, an imprint of Hyperion Publishers. The fourth series, called 'T*witches,' is written by H.B. Gilmour and Randi Reisfeld and is aimed at preteens. 'T*witches' is published by Scholastic, regarded as the key player in series books, given its success with 
'Goosebumps,' 'The Baby-sitters Club,' 'Animorphs,' 
'Dear America' and, of course, 'Harry Potter.'...Scholastic publisher and editor in chief Jean Feiwel said the new series have merely tapped into an increased teen interest in witches. 'It's almost gotten - dare I say it - acceptable,' Feiwel said. There's no doubt that fantasy and wizards have become more popular because of Harry Potter. Practicing witches are amused by this trend in teen books. 'It's nice to see that we are not always the bad guys anymore,' laughed Wren Walker, co-founder of 'The Witches Voice,' an umbrella Web site for witchcraft groups..."

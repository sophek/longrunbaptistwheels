        <h1>JESUS DID NOT DIE SPIRITUALLY PT 2 - KAU#024</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Many claim that Christ atoned for the sins of the world by dying physically on the Cross AND through suffering in Hell. Others do not go quite this far, but nevertheless claim that Jesus "died spiritually" on the Cross. This so-called "spiritual death" of Jesus is the ground and support for the myth of Christ suffering in Hell. If this "spiritual death" idea is proven to be wrong doctrinally, the whole thing will fall to the ground.

Last week it was shown that Jesus went to Paradise which was once in Hell:

Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

The KJV is clear. There is no time for any suffering in Hell of Jesus since He and the thief were to be in Paradise that very day after dying physically. This part of the doctrine is therefore at once refuted Biblically. Jesus did not suffer in Hell. But let us meet an objection. Did not Jesus bear our punishment? And does not mankind deserve absolute, eternal torment in Hell? Therefore, would not Jesus have to go to Hell and suffer to bear the punishment we deserved? This objection can be dismissed by observing three points:

1. Based on such logic, Christ would have to stay in Hell for all eternity since that is what mankind deserves. Since He did not suffer for all eternity, there is obviously something wrong with the logic.

2. The lost do not go to "Hell" for all eternity in the first place. The lost end up in the "Lake of Fire." Hell is only the intermediate holding prison:

Revelation 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

The lost clearly come out of Hell to go into the Lake of Fire. Therefore, for the argument to even begin to be valid, the Bible must show Christ suffering in the Lake of Fire. Yet, it says Christ was not left in "Hell." This is not the Lake of Fire, nor does it say He suffered in Hell.

3. The objection fails to understand that the reason Christ did not have to suffer for all eternity in the same place (i.e. the Lake of Fire) as lost man is because He is greater than lost man. When man fell in Adam, he became bound to suffer death for all eternity in the Lake of Fire. Jesus did not have to suffer eternal death in the Lake of Fire because Jesus is more valuable than man. His physical death on the Cross wipes out the sin debt of the whole human race. All man must do is receive this free gift through believing. If it is logical that Jesus must suffer in the Lake of Fire, then it is logical that He would have to do so billions of times, a different time for every person (an absurdity)! Because Christ is so much greater than man, it only took His one death to redeem every person. If Christ did not have to die a separate death for every person, then neither did He have to suffer in the same place they will have to go if they reject His free gift.

How are believers ever to arrive at a clear understanding of this subject? It is only through Biblical revelation that we can ever know such things. If Jesus died spiritually, why then does the Bible say man was
redeemed by His Blood when He died on the Cross? Certainly, the "spirit" is greater than the body. If Christ died spiritually to redeem mankind, then it would be clearly stated in Scripture. But what do we find?:

1 Peter 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.

Colossians 1:21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

Hebrews 10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

Why does it say "body" in these verses? Why not "spirit"? If Christ died spiritually, then His spirit was "offered." Yet it says "body."

1 Peter 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

Why "blood"? Why not "spirit"?

Ephesians 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;

Why "flesh" and not "spirit"? These verses are clear. God-willing, we will continue to look at this issue in upcoming weeks, mainly concentrating on objections that are made against this truth.

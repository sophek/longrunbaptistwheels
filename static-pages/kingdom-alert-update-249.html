SATAN'S PERVERSION OF THE WORD "COMFORT" IN THESE LAST DAYS
************************************************************************

1 Thessalonians 5:11 Wherefore COMFORT yourselves together, and edify one
another, even as also ye do.

In this study, we will compare the modern definition of the word "comfort"
to the older definition. There has been a change of emphasis. And I
believe that the Devil has been behind the changes in this word.

Too often, we have the wrong definition in our minds about this word
"comfort." The "man-is-good-and-I-am-a-victim" mentality that
psychological-philosophy has brought into the churches (i.e. the new
Christianity of the "ME" generation), is the tool Satan has used to
pervert this important Biblical word. The word is deeper than we realize,
when it is applied in a spiritual manner. Too often, we have only the "air
conditioner, remote-control, put your feet up in a recliner," idea of
"comfort." Many Christians then study the Biblical passages concerning
"comfort," and they automatically superimpose this worldly, modern,
psychobabble definition upon the word. The result is strife in the homes,
and in the churches, as Christians begin to complain that they do not
"feel comfortable." The modern, "I have needs" fad has brought forth a
generation of worldly Christians that say such things as:

"If I don't feel comfortable in my marriage, I deserve a new one!"

"If I don't feel comfortable during the preaching, I am being spiritually
abused."

"Christianity is supposed to make ME comfortable."

Thus, people like Robert Schuller teach that we need a new Christianity
for this new generation, and they are trying to launch a new reformation
that replaces the classic view of humility with self-esteem, and the Bible
with psychology. But they will never find true, Biblical comfort in this
fashion. With this wrong idea of comfort, Christians soon begin to be
attacked by the Devil, or they begin to suffer persecution, and they then
either turn back, or they become discouraged. "Where is the comfort?,"
they ask. "Where are the comforting sermons?," they ask the preacher. "Why
isn't everyone comforting me?," they ask. Well, maybe many of these people
HAVE been greatly comforted. But they have had the wrong idea about
Biblical comfort!:

Mark 10:29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no
man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother,
or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and
brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, WITH
PERSECUTIONS; and in the world to come eternal life.

The Lord never promised that our Christian walk would be free from trials
or persecutions. And persecution is not necessarily a sign that you are on
the wrong road. According to Paul's inspired words, it is often an
additional sign that you are on the right road (2 Timothy 3:12,
Philippians 1:28).

Nevertheless, many ignore the Bible's warnings against being spoiled and
corrupted with worldly philosophies and evil communications (Colossians
2:8, 1 Corinthians 15:33). And therefore, they begin to conclude that any
doctrine or lifestyle that brings conflict and persecution, cannot be the
right path! They interpret truth based upon experience, and whether or not
it brings IMMEDIATE feelings of "comfort." When these feelings of
"comfort" are no longer present, they then turn away or turn back:

Psalms 36:1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
there is no fear of God before his eyes.
3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: HE HATH LEFT OFF to be
wise, and to do good.
4 â€¦he abhorreth not evil.

Luke 9:62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
plough, and LOOKING BACK, is fit for the kingdom of God.

Hebrews 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but IF ANY MAN DRAW BACK,
my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

Matthew 13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but DURETH FOR A WHILE: for when
TRIBULATION OR PERSECUTION ariseth because of the word, by and by HE IS
OFFENDED.

We must learn to love God's truth, so that we will not be easily offended
when we have trouble:

Psalms 119:165 Great PEACE have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
offend them.

Notice, that God is not against us experience His peace. He promises that
the righteous will have GREAT peace. But the condition is that they must
love the Lord's LAW. But this is the very age that HATES God's
commandments. It has turned God's grace into lasciviousness (Jude 1). Is
it then no wonder, that this is the age of MISERABLE people? Only in the
last days, when so many despise God's law, could there be so many people
who have FEW PROBLEMS, setting out to INVENT and make problems for
themselves! Discontentment is raging among Christians. Many do not have
peace. This is because they are despising God's commandments and ways as
something grievous and hurtful. If God's commandment hurts their flesh or
pride, or if it inconveniences them in any way, they flee it. They are
seeking "comfort." But to run from God's ways and laws, is to run away
from true peace and happiness:

Genesis 4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
thy countenance fallen?
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?â€¦

John 13:17 If ye know these things, HAPPY are ye IF YE DO them.

John 14:27 PEACE I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: NOT AS THE
WORLD GIVETH, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let
it be afraid.

The "peace" that Jesus gives is very different from the so-called "peace"
that comes from following the ways of the world. The "peace" that the
world gives is instantaneous. However, it only lasts a brief season. We
see people going the way of the flesh, and they conclude, "I never felt so
much peace." Yes, snorting cocaine also brings good feelings. Marijuana
and alcohol bring temporary elation and euphoria. But they also bite like
serpents IN THE END, leaving a person with even greater emptiness and
vexation of spirit. It is not wise to seek a temporary "high." Moses
understood this truth, and applied it to his own life:

Hebrews 11:25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin FOR A SEASON;

I am sure the Prodigal Son could have written to his father during his
merriment, and said, "Things have never been better. I am in great peace."
Jonah was sleeping so soundly, that they had to awake him in the storm.
Ah, but the Devil's peace burns away like expensive fireworks. Up, up, and
away, andâ€¦poof! They are gone. Before long, the bliss has ended, and the
reaping begins:

Ecclesiastes 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to
do evil.
 
It is FRUIT we are looking for, and good, lasting fruit does not often
appear overnight:

Mark 4:5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
IMMEDIATELY IT SPRANG UP, because it had no depth of earth:
6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it
withered away.

Rebellion, like whiskey, will always bring an IMMEDIATE flush of elation.
Yet, its end is regurgitations and sickly dizziness. "Liberty" from
responsibility will always scratch our ears and pat our heads as we sit in
its lap. But we will soon find that our leash is much shorter than it was
when we were walking in the light of God's commandments (2 Peter 2:19, 1
John 5:3)! The "peace" of the world soon becomes pricks in our side
(Proverbs 13:15). But the fruit of obedience to God, though there may be
some trials and "growing pains," will always, in the end, bring us true
peace and joy unspeakable:

Hebrews 12:11 Now no chastening for the PRESENT seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous: nevertheless AFTERWARD it yieldeth the PEACEABLE fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

Let us, therefore, resist this principle lie of the Devil, that if our
path is true and right, we will have no trouble, and feel no pain. The
Bible speaks of darts and wiles of the Devil, and it calls us to stand
against a flurry of Satanic opposition! We must not be deceived by those
who would lead us astray about the meaning of the word "comfort." They
say:

"Is not God the God of all COMFORT (2 Corinthians 1:3)? Why then this pain
of CONVICTION in your flesh? Why then do you have these growing pains, as
the Lord's local body works upon you to bring forth maturity and
righteousness in your weak areas? Why these battles? Why this warfare? You
must be in the wrong place! You have chosen the wrong path! You have had
some trials since you have walked this path. This must be proof that you
are on the wrong path (Jeremiah 44:18). Where is the COMFORT? The
Christian walk is not meant to be a battle. You are under too much
pressure. Let go and give in and turn away. Seek COMFORT!"

The older saints, who did not live in our shallow, pampered,
self-centered, effeminate age, understood that Biblical "comfort" did NOT
mean, freedom from any danger, trial or warfare:

"Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others
fought to win the prize, and sailed through bloody seas? Are there no foes
for me to face? Must I not stem the flood? Is this vile world a friend to
grace, to help me on to God? Sure I must fight, if I would reign; increase
my courage, Lord. I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, supported by thy
word."
(Isaac Watts, "Am I A Soldier?")

"There is some danger of falling into a soft and effeminate Christianity,
under the plea of a lofty and ethereal [heavenly] theology. Christianity
was born for endurance; not an exotic, but a hardy plant, braced by the
keen wind; not languid [drooping; sickly], nor childish, nor cowardly. It
walks with strong step and erect frame; it is kindly, but firm; it is
gentle, but honest; it is calm, but not facile [easily performed];
obliging, but not imbecile [weak-minded]; decided, but not churlish
[stubborn]. It does not fear to speak the stern word of condemnation
against error, nor to raise its voice against surrounding evil, under the
pretext it is not of this world, it does not shrink from giving honest
reproof, lest it come under the charge of displaying an unchristian
spirit. It calls sin sin, in whomsoever it is found, and would rather risk
the accusation of being actuated by a bad spirit than not to discharge an
explicit duty. Let us not misjudge strong words used in honest
controversy. Out of the heat a viper may come forth; but we shake it off
and feel no harm. The religion of both Old and New Testaments is marked by
fervent testimonies against evil. To speak smooth things in such a case
may be sentimentalism, but it is not Christianity.â€¦It is a betrayal of
truth and righteousness. I know that charity covers a multitude of sins;
but it does not call evil good, because a good man has done it; it does
not excuse inconsistencies, because the inconsistent brother has a high
name and a fervent spirit; crookedness and worldliness are still
crookedness, though exhibited in one who seems to have reached no common
height of attainment."
(Horatius Bonar, 1818-1899)

Those who flee the light to escape any fight or pain, will NOT find peace
in the end. They will find depression and vanity:

Isaiah 57:21 There is NO PEACE, saith my God, to the wicked.

Do not be deceived by the TEMPORARY, fleeting feelings of peace, that
disobedience and falsehood bring to the heart. False teachers use this
temporary tickling and scratching to lead people away from the place of
true fruit-bearing:

Jeremiah 6:14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
SLIGHTLY, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the OLD
PATHS, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall FIND REST for
your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

The supposed modern "truths" of pop-psychology only poison the precious
water. We will seek for the old paths; the way that has been prepared for
us by God. The way that has been "cast up," or cleared by God from
spiritual danger:

Jeremiah 18:15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned
incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from
the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;

It is crucial that we have the right idea about God's COMFORT. It is not
comfort because it is free from any growing pains. It is not comfort
because it is free from any trials or battles. Christianity is not a
comfort because it brings peace to all your relationships with people.
There will be tribulations with men and persecutions (Matthew 10:34-36).

Let us notice the true definition of this word "COMFORT":

"1. To STRENGTHEN; to invigorateâ€¦"
(Webster's., 1828)

"1. To STRENGTHEN (morally or spiritually)â€¦"
(Oxford Dictionary)

"1. To give consolation, encouragement, or moral STRENGTH to; to cheer;
encourageâ€¦to relieve the suffering or pain ofâ€¦.TO STRENGTHENâ€¦"
(Standard Dictionary, 1895)

"1. To console; to STRENGTHENâ€¦"
(American Diamond Pronouncing Dictionary, 1878)

"1. [From Latin] comfortare, to STRENGTHENâ€¦"
(Blackies Compact Etymological Dictionary)

The emphasis in these older definitions of "comfort" is correct, for we
can see the very word "FORT" in the word "comfort"! What does "fort" mean?
It means "STRONG." The word "forte" refers to a person's "strong" point.
"Forte" in music, is the place where the music is played with force or
strength.

In this true meaning of the word, we have found the difference between
Christianity and the world, and between God's way and the Devil's way. To
comfort someone in a Biblical sense is to help them STAND. It is not true,
spiritual comfort to tell someone, "There is no battle. You do not have to
fight. You are free to remain passive; you are free to compromise." Joshua
and Caleb did not lie to the people in such a way. But they DID seek to
COMFORT them in the sense of strengthening their faith and resolve for the
battle:

Numbers 13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us
go up at once, and possess it; for WE ARE WELL ABLE TO OVERCOME IT.
31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against
the people; for they are stronger than we.

The first thing to get straight is the two different approaches. God means
we are to encourage people to fight sin by His promises and power. The
world means we are to comfort people by REDEFINING SIN, or telling them
that they are not responsible for it!

Notice the subtle change of emphasis concerning the definition of the word
"comfort" in the new dictionaries:

COMFORT:

"1. To SOOTHEâ€¦" (Modern Webster's Ency. Dict., 1989)

"1. To SOOTHEâ€¦" (American Heritage, 1997)

This is radical change of emphasis! I believe this change of emphasis
concerning the definition of the word "comfort" is an illustration of what
has occurred on the large scale in theology itself. We have left the age
of responsibility, and we have entered the final age of Laodicean
self-pampering. No longer are Christians COMFORTED to stand strong in the
will of God, by precious promises which inspire faith, hope, and love.
Many are now "soothed" into a state of passivity and tranquility by smooth
words:

Isaiah 30:9 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children
that will not hear the law of the LORD:
10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto
us right things, speak unto us SMOOTH THINGS, prophesy deceits:

A preacher may be filled with the Holy Ghost, and through diligent study
and prayer, he may be providing everything necessary for Christians to
stand in their battles. They hear that God is alive and that He is for us,
and that He is in us, and that He is calling us, and wants to empower us.
They hear true words that will inspire hope and love. This man is truly a
"comforting" preacher! But then the false teachers come and say,"All this
talk about overcoming is spiritual abuse! Return to Egypt. Lay down your
weapons. Let the giants alone." These are indeed soothing words, but they
are not strengthening words! Therefore, they are not truly comforting
words. Biblically comforting words will strengthen our faith, hope and
love for God and His will. The Thessalonians were "comforted" with the
promise that physical death was no bar to reigning with Christ in His
coming Kingdom. In other words, they were strengthened to place their
faith in God, and to endure their afflictions in hope.

Now that we have seen that Biblical "comfort" includes the idea of
"strengthening" us to stand in our battles (instead of "soothing" us to
lay down our spiritual armour), it is important to see that we can only be
truly strengthened in such a way BY GOD'S WORD:

1 Thessalonians 4:18 Wherefore COMFORT one another WITH THESE WORDS.

Romans 15:4 For whatsoever things were WRITTEN aforetime were written for
our learning, that we through patience and COMFORT OF THE SCRIPTURES might
have hope.

"â€¦it is simply and only a question of becoming acquainted with God, and
getting to know what He is, and what He does, and what He feelsâ€¦.Divine
comfort does not come to us in any mysterious or arbitrary way. It comes
as the result of a divine method. The indwelling Comforter 'brings to our
remembrance' comforting things concerning our Lord, and, if we believe
them, we are comforted by themâ€¦.if we are to be comforted by the
Scriptures, we must first believe them. Nothing that God has said can
possibly comfort a person who does not believe it to be really trueâ€¦.In
this manner of comfort it is exactly as it is in every other experience in
the religious life. God says, 'Believe, and then you can feel.' We say,
'Feel, and then we can believe.'"
(Hannah Whitall Smith, "The God of All Comfort")

Worldly philosophy will not truly comfort us to endure our trials and face
the enemy. It will make us weak and spiritually anemic:

Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man SPOIL YOU through philosophy and vain
deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and
not after Christ.

Notice another Scripture:

1 Thessalonians 5:14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are
unruly, COMFORT THE FEEBLEMINDED, support the weak, be patient toward all
men.

It does not say, "Tell the feeble-minded that they have no responsibility
to stand or exercise faith in God." No! We are to help these Christians
STAND by reminding them of God's promises:

1 Thessalonians 3:1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought
it good to be left at Athens alone;
2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to ESTABLISH YOU, and to COMFORT
YOU concerning your faith:
3 THAT NO MAN SHOULD BE MOVED BY THESE AFFLICTIONSâ€¦

The above passage presents the true meaning and purpose of Biblical
comfort with complete clarity. We are "comforted" (strengthened,
encouraged, etc.) that we will be emboldened to STAND in the face of our
trials and enemies.

Only the Holy Scriptures are capable of strengthening us to stand. Let the
world rush by with its distractions and pleas for us to turn aside from
the battle. We will take comfort in the Word of God; we will be
strengthened to fight by His promises and warnings:

Psalms 119:50 THIS is MY COMFORT in my affliction: for THY WORD hath
quickened me.
51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from
thy law.
52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD

************************************************************
PUBLISHER OF N.I.V. ALSO PUBLISHES "SATANIC BIBLE"
************************************************************
"In 1988, Zondervan became a division of HarperCollins, one of the world's
leading English-language publishers. HarperCollins is part of News America
Publishing Group, a division of News Corporationâ€¦"
(Zondervan, Customer Support)
 
If you visit online at Harpercollins.com, you will find some very
discouraging and evil books for sale that are published by this company.
There are number of PRO-HOMOSEXUAL titles. And amidst these evil books, we
find the following advertisement from this same publishing company:

"The foregoing is excerpted from 'Satanic Bible' by Anton La Vey. All
rights reserved. No part of this book may be used or reproduced without
written permission from HarperCollins Publishers, 10 East 53rd Street, New
York, NY 10022"

Notice that HarperCollins not only publishes homosexual books, they
publish the "Satanic Bible"!

And then, what else do we find offered from such a publisher of sleazy,
God-forsaken books in these last days? Let's read some more from their own
web site:

"'The Holy Bible (Mass Market PB): New International Version,'"

This leading publisher of homosexual books, and blatantly Satanic books,
is also the publisher of the NIV!:

James 3:12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a
vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
 
Zondervan is a subsidiary of HarperCollins, which is owned by News Corp,
which is owned by Rupert Murdoch. He is one of the biggest produces of
worldwide pornography on the planet. And his company, Zondervan, holds the
exclusive distribution rights to the NIV. This conglomerate also publishes
"Good News for Modern Man" and "The Amplified Version."

In these perilous, last days, pornography has evolved into a $10 billion
per year industry! This is not surprising. Once we even begin to frown
upon the landmarks and barriers set by former generations, we are sliding
down a slippery slope: "The old ways are not good enough for our
generation. The old paths are too narrow (Jer.6:16, Heb12:13). The Old
Version is too restrictive. We want to wear what we please and view
whatever we desire." But once a knot is finally untied, the whole quickly
unravels. Pornography never satisfies:

Proverbs 27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
never satisfied.

Those who view pornography become enslaved by it. They must become
increasingly depraved as they demand things more perverse than before
(Rom.1:26, Prov.1:19). Pornography breeds sodomy. And then sodomy breeds
child molestation and other vile deeds. Therefore, a society given over to
pornography under the guise of "free speech," is a society that is
exploding (or about to explode) with rapists, murderers, cannibals,
adulterers, molesters, abusers, etc. The Word of God (and the experience
of history) teaches that a nation or kingdom given over to such depravity
will quickly self-destruct. The Bible predicts just such a state for the
entire world in the coming Tribulation period:

Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

The Bible NEVER says we are to be gullible or simple! In fact, it clearly
warns against these things:

Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your LOVE may abound yet more and
more in KNOWLEDGE and in ALL JUDGMENT;

Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man
looketh well to his going.

Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, but rather REPROVE them.
13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for
whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

2 Corinthians 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are
NOT IGNORANT of his devices.

If we believe in a literal Devil who is transformed into an angel of light
(along with his ministers), do we really think that he will not attempt to
corrupt the Word of God? My second question is, in what manner will he
attempt to corrupt it? Will he launch an open attack or a SUBTIL attack?
Did ye never read in the scriptures (Mt. 21:42, Gen. 3:1, 2 Cor.11:3)?

Should these new bible publishers (owned by men making millions off of
pornography) be trusted to provide you with the unadulterated Word of God?
They live for money. Why is it that they are not afraid to promote the
N.I.V.? Could it be that they know that these versions are so watered-down
that they will not hurt their blossoming pornography business?

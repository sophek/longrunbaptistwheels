GOOD FRIDAY: THE BAD FABLE
**********************************

"Fish...were sacred to the Great Goddess under all her many names...Hence they were eaten in her honor on the day that was specially dedicated to her, that is on Friday. It is scarcely necessary to add, that her Scandinavian name was Friga, from which our Frigaday, or Friday, is derived. And it is equally well known, that her attributes...have now been transferred to the Roman Madonna."
(G.H. Pember, "The Great Prophecies," Vol. 4, p.182)

Scholars who believe that Jesus was crucified on "Friday" tell us that we must understand figurative language in the Jewish manner of reckoning time, etc. This view maintains that the Bible is only literally true and infallible in its spiritual, devotional teachings. The truth of the matter is that these scholars cannot provide Biblical examples of this so-called "figurative language" in the reckoning of time. They confuse relative language with figurative language (they are not the same). Bible prophecy is fulfilled literally. We can see this truth clearly presented in the various prophecies that were fulfilled in regard to the First Coming of our Lord. In fact, prophecy is often so literal, that it defies even the most conservative, literal expectations. For example, in Isaiah 53:4-5, the prophecy concerning the healing of "sorrows" and "griefs," was partially fulfilled in literal, PHYSICAL healings (see Isaiah 53:4-5 and Matthew 8:17). Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah riding on an ass (Matthew 21:5), being beaten to the point of stripes (1 Peter 2:24), not having bones broken (John 19:36), having his garments parted (Matthew 27:35), being born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:5), being born of a virgin (Matthew 1:23), and many others in regard to time, place and event, were fulfilled literally. Certainly, we can be sure that the prophecies related to the Second Coming will likewise be fulfilled to the letter. I have included this introduction to this study of "Good Friday" in order to show that when Jesus used the phrase "three days and THREE nights," He did not mean "three days and TWO nights." He was not using allegorical language. And although the Bible often uses relative language, such language never turns "three" nights into "two" nights; that would not be relative language; it would be erroneous nonsense.

There are two boundary lines or markers that reveal when our Lord was crucified. The first marker is found in our Lord's prophecy concerning how long He will be in the tomb, in the heart of the earth:

Matthew 12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and THREE NIGHTS in the heart of the earth.

A Friday crucifixion and burial would not allow Jesus to be in the tomb for three nights. Friday night and Saturday night would make only two nights. And we know that by early Sunday morning, the Lord had already risen:

Mark 16:9 Now when Jesus was RISEN EARLY THE FIRST DAY of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

John 20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, WHEN IT WAS YET DARK, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

Therefore, in order for the Lord to be in the tomb for three nights, He would have had to have remained in the grave at least part of Sunday night. Yet, He had already risen before daylight on Sunday morning! "Good Friday" is therefore a "bad fable."

In fact, it is not even possible to get three DAYS in the tomb out of a Friday crucifixion. The phrase "three days and three nights" uses the word "day" to refer to the daylight portion of a 24-hour period. The word "day" cannot mean the whole 24 hour period, as it does in some Scriptures, since the word "night" is included along with the word "day." The word "day" in this phrase, must therefore refer to the daylight portion of the day and night period. Yet, if Jesus was crucified on Friday and was buried before 6:00pm on Friday, He would only be in the tomb for TWO of these daylight periods (i.e. Friday and Saturday). We have seen that He was already out of the tomb BEFORE sunrise on Sunday (John 20:1). Therefore, He could not be said (even in a relative sense) to have been in the tomb for THREE DAYS. We must conclude that "Good Friday" is a myth. And it is used by Satan to cast doubt on the Scriptures. The Devil desires for Christians to doubt that the Bible has been inspired or perfectly preserved in regard to numbers, places, names, etc. But if we resist the Devil, he will flee! We resist him by concluding that our Lord could not have been crucified on Friday.

When Was Our Lord Crucified?

To answer this question, we must call attention to the second marker:

Luke 24:19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be CONDEMNED TO DEATH, and have CRUCIFIED HIM.
21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, TO DAY IS THE THIRD DAY SINCE THESE THINGS were done.

The word "these" is plural. It refers to the condemning and crucifying of Jesus. These two disciples are walking and speaking some time after morning on Sunday (mid-day). The word "since" means "after":

"Since": "After; from the time that. The proper signification of since is after."
("Webster's Dictionary," 1828)

 A Friday crucifixion would make Sunday the SECOND day "since these things were done." Therefore, the crucifixion and burial occurred on THURSDAY. This would make Sunday the "third" day "since" Thursday. A similar phrase is used in Acts 24:11:

Acts 24:11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but TWEVE DAYS SINCE I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

Paul was speaking on the thirteenth day; yet it was twelve days "since" the first day he went up to Jerusalem:

"It would be easy for Felix to ascertain the facts, for only twelve days had passed since he returned to Judea, after many years absence. Of these twelve, the first is the day Paul meets James and the elders (Acts 21:18), the second he enters upon his vow (Acts 21:26), the seventh he is seized in the temple (Acts 21:27), the eighth tried before the Sanhedrin (Acts 22:30), the eleventh day he is delivered to Felix (Acts 23:33), and the thirteenth appears before his court."
("People's New Testament Commentary")

In regard to our Lord, Sunday at mid-day (Luke 24) was therefore the "third day" since the events that occurred on Thursday.

It can be seen from Luke 24:21 that a Wednesday crucifixion (although it avoids the fable of Good Friday), would make Sunday afternoon the "FOURTH DAY since these things were done." It must therefore be rejected.

Some have argued that a Thursday crucifixion would not allow enough time for "three days and three nights." The answer is found in the fact that "relative language" is not the same as "figurative language." The Bible often defines a time period in "days" without necessarily giving us EXACTLY how much of the day is meant. In such language "days' are not meant in a hyperbolic sense, or in a figurative sense. For example, "days" do not mean "years" or a "really short time," etc. In such Biblical phrases, "days" mean "days," literally. However, the exact portion of the day intended is not revealed. A portion of day is obviously counted as a day:

Genesis 42:17 And he put them all together into ward THREE DAYS.
18 And Joseph said unto them THE THIRD DAY, This do, and live; for I fear God:
19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

Notice they were said to be in prison "three days." Yet, they left prison before the third day had ended, and were therefore only in prison for PART of the third day.

Notice another example:

2 Chronicles 10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me AFTER THREE DAYS. And the people departed.
12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam ON THE THIRD DAY, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.

The phrase "after three days" means after any part of these days, meaning all of the first and third days, or a part of the first, all of the second, and a part of the third.

Notice a final example:

Esther 4:16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink THREE DAYS, NIGHT OR DAY: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
5:1 Now it came to pass ON THE THIRD DAY, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
4 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come THIS DAY unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.

We again see that only a portion of the third day is considered in the phrase.

Therefore, when Jesus was in the tomb for part of Thursday, all of Friday, and all of Saturday (the sunlight portion of the day), as well as Thursday night, Friday night, and some small portion of Saturday night, He can be said to have been in the tomb three days and three nights. The word "full" is never mentioned, and need not be implied based upon the numerous Old Testament Scriptures that reveal that a portion of a day can be said to be a day.

When the Scriptures speak of Jesus rising on the "third day," there is no "night" included in the phraseology. Therefore, we can conclude that the word "day" in such Scriptures refers to the day and night period together (24 hours). Jesus was buried before the Sabbath began (it began at 6:00pm). From 4:30pm Thursday to 4:30pm Friday would make one day. From 4:30pm Friday to 4:30pm Saturday would be the second day. From 4:30pm Saturday to some time Saturday night (before sunrise), would make a portion of the third day, and thus would be a resurrection "on" the third day.

There is therefore nothing figurative in the phrase "three days and three nights." The fact that a portion of a day can be counted as a day provides absolutely no ground for interpreting "three days and three nights" as "three days and two nights" or "two days and two nights." Counting a portion of a day as a day is much different from calling two nights as three nights. The word "day" does not necessarily reveal whether a whole or a part is intended. Nevertheless, it certainly reveals that SOME part is intended. Therefore, "three days and three nights" in the tomb is properly and Biblically counted from a Thursday crucifixion; yet such a phrase cannot possibly be counted from a Friday crucifixion. Let us resist the popular habit of sweeping literal Scripture under the rug by calling it a "Hebraism" or by suggesting that "our western, rational minds cannot easily understand the allegory of Jewish Scripture," etc. The "southern mind" calls this attempt to manipulate the Scriptures "hogwash!"

****************************************************
THE ORIGIN OF THE EASTER BUNNY AND EGGS
****************************************************

The ancient pagans believed that the "goddess" Venus was hatched from an EGG (i.e. Brewer's "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," 1894, p.1271). G.H. Pember writes:

"With the same goddess [Venus, Ishtar, Aphrodite, Diana, etc.] the egg, also, is connected."
(G.H. Pember, "The Great Prophecies," Vol. 4, p.182)

Hislop, in his "Two Babylons," explains:

"The Classic poets are full of the mystic egg of the Babylonians; and thus its tale is told by Hyginus, the Egyptian, the learned keeper of the Palatine library at Rome in the time of Augustus, who was skilled in all the wisdom of his native country: 'An egg of wondrous size is said to have fallen from heaven into the river Euphrates. The fishes rolled it to the bank, where the doves having settled upon it, and hatched it, out came Venus, who afterwards was called the Syrian Goddess, that is, Astarte. Hence the egg became one of the symbols of Astarte or Easter: and, accordingly, in Cyprus, one of the chosen seats of the worship of Venus or Astarte, the egg of wondrous size was represented on a grand scale." (pp. 175-6).

The Bible teaches that at one time, all the world was united at the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:4). It is, therefore, not surprising that we find a similar paganism, with similar legends and rituals, in the various peoples of the world. Robert Govett, in his "English Derived From Hebrew," reveals the similar linguistic roots (many that are quite amazing) that have been left in place in spite of the obvious scrambling by God. This fact is clearly revealed in the study of the gods, goddesses and rituals of ancient pagans scattered throughout the world. It is for this reason that the goddess and her "egg" is found throughout ancient paganism; it has been preserved today by Roman Catholicism.

"...the [ancient] Persians, when they keep the festival of the solar new [year]., (in March)...present each other with colored eggs." ("People's Encyclopedia," 1886, p. 607)

"The practice of presenting eggs to our friends at Easter is Magian or Persian, and bears allusion to the mundane egg." (E. Cobham Brewer, "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," 1894, p.402)

Thus, we see the history of the egg, as it is associated with the fertility and the mother goddess. But where did the "bunny" originate? The rabbit or hare is called a "bunny" due to its "bun" tail. The hare was a sacred animal that was worshipped by early Britons. When Rome "converted" these pagans, it left many of the pagan rituals and practices in place. This fact was openly admitted by Pope Gregory, who saw it as a pragmatic condescension to the ignorant heathens. Such compromises were often publicly opposed by early pastors until Rome became powerful enough to enforce its will throughout the empire. Notice the ancient Easter bunny among the Britons (from whom modern culture, through Catholicism, inherited most of its modern paganism):

"...the killing and eating of the HARE, hen and goose were forbidden among the Britons...The HARE was used for divination by Boudicca, doubtless as a sacred animal, and it has been found that a sacred character still attaches to these animals in Wales."
(J.A. MacCulloch, "The Religion of the Ancient Celts," 1911)

"The HARE were sacred to the early British...The later folk-tale tradition is full of hare legends, while in witch cults it is a frequent form for metamorphosis."
(Anne Ross, "Pagan Celtic Britain," 1967)

German immigrants helped bring the mythology surrounding the "hare" to America. The peoples of ancient Germany and Britain shared a similar paganism, with names and practices that were clearly related. Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) in his "Teutonic Mythology" documents a connection between the paganism of ancient Germany and that of ancient Britain:

"...heathenism was crowded with divinities of various shapes and varying name, but who in their characteristics and cultus, corresponded to one another." (Vol. 1, p.289)

A modern researcher argues the same point:

"...Anglo-Saxon paganism may have been as rich and diverse as that of the southern and western European peoples...the contrast between Celt and German is made far to often and sharply by scholars...[For example] scholars of German and Norse mythology identify the Scandinavian Odin, the German Wotan and the Anglo-Saxon Woden as the same figure."
(Ronald Hutton, "The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles," 1991)

The custom of the Easter Bunny and eggs has been documented in Germany by Georg Franck of Frankenau (1643-1704). He recorded in his medical paper, "De ovis paschalibus - von Oster Eyern" (1682), some of the various customs associated with the "Osterhase" (i.e. Easter Hare), and the negative effects of eating too many "Easter eggs."

Cotgrave in his dictionary of 1611 refers to "Pasch-egges" at Easter-time.

There is much harm in teaching children that good things mysteriously arise from mythological beings. Children should be taught from the earliest age that the God of the Bible is the Divine Giver of all that is good (Luke 11:13, etc.).

*****************************************************
DID EARLY CHRISTIANS CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER?
*****************************************************

It appears that early Christians celebrated a Christian Passover every time they partook of the Lord's Supper (1 Corinthians 11:24-26, 5:8,11). It was also to be a daily way of life, spiritually; and the only ordained memorial was the regular observance of the Supper. No Christian church was bound to observe any Jewish festivals:

Galatians 4:9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
10 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

"There is no indication of the observance of the Easter festival in the New Testament, or in the writings of the apostolic Fathers...The ecclesiastical historian Socrates ('Hist. Eccl.,' v. 22) states, with perfect truth, that neither the Lord nor his apostles enjoined the keeping of this or any other festival. He says: 'The apostles had no thought of appointing festival days, but of promoting a life of blamelessness and piety'; and he attributes the observance of Easter by the church to the perpetuation of an old usage, 'just as many other customs have been established.'"
("Encyclopedia Britannica," 1911)

The only use of the word "Easter" in the English Bible (AV) is found in Acts 12:

Acts 12:4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

In this verse, there is no warrant for a yearly observance of Passover (of any kind) for Christians. It is referring either to a "holiday" celebrated by pagan Herod (that occurred around the same time as the Jewish Passover), or it is referring to the Jewish Passover, itself. In either case, we do not find any record in the Bible of Christians observing a yearly, Christianized Passover. Christians are at liberty to observe various holy days, as long as they do not make them obligatory or corrupt them with paganism (like the Roman Catholics):

Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:

Romans 14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it...

Jeremiah 10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen...
3 For the customs of the people are vain...

Leviticus 18:3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

"In the literature of the sub-apostolic age...there is no reference to a celebration of yearly festival of the resurrection or pascha...Trypho charged the Christians with not keeping the Jewish feasts or the Sabbath; the reply was that Christians did not place any virtue in keeping such festivals (Justin Martyr, 'Trypho,' x)."
("The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," 1909)

Justin (110-165) wrote his "Apology" in the second century. It is true that a tradition to observe the annual Passover (in a Christian fashion) entered into many churches very rapidly. However, it is certain that there is no Biblical command or Apostolic example that would make such an observance a necessary obligation. In this day and age when so many denominations and churches are yoking with Rome (and raw paganism is reviving in the world and in the churches), it is crucial that we reexamine even some of the traditions that have been viewed as harmless by many saints in earlier years. Satan's goal appears to be to use such traditions as bridges to his coming one-world "church."

**********************************
IS THE AV WRONG IN ACTS 12:4?
**********************************
Acts 12:3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

There are two views with rich linguistic backing concerning the word "Easter" in the AV. I will cite the evidence for both views. Neither view requires a "correction" in the AV.

The first view maintains that the word "Easter" is derived from a pagan word. If this view is true, it therefore follows that Herod was observing his own pagan holiday, or perhaps his own synthesized-mixture of Judaism and paganism. In regard to this view, it is significant that no Christian is ever seen observing anything called "Easter" in the Bible. Herod was a man who killed Christians and accepted worship as if he were a "god."

Yet, some will wonder how Herod could be observing a holiday with a British name. The answer to this is the same reason that money in the Bible is called "pounds" (Luke 19). All ancient, pagan cultures celebrated a spring-time festival around the time of the Jewish Passover. Since the Bible was translated into English, "Easter" is therefore the proper name for this pagan festival, just as "pounds" is the proper name for money, etc.

Those of us who believe in the absolute preservation of Scripture see the AV as the perfect words of God in English. We believe that the KJV Translators were led by God's Providence to choose the right, inspired words scattered throughout all copies and versions. While it is probable that the Greek word for Passover (pascha) was the word they translated as Easter, it is also possible that they possessed other manuscripts or were led to reconstruct the text from earlier versions in this place. Such Divine leading is no more "inspiration" than the Divine Providence that led Christians to choose the exact 66 Books for the Bible Canon. The same omnipotent God that can lead His people to choose the right Books of the Bible, can lead them to choose the right words that make up those Books, and translate them into English properly.

Let us notice some of the linguistic evidence for viewing "Easter" as a pagan word. Then, we will notice some of the evidence for the opposing view. Again, in this one place where "Easter" is used, since Herod is the subject, there is no "error," regardless of the view that is adopted.

=====================================
Evidence That Easter Is A Pagan Word
=====================================

"What means the term Easter itself? It is not a Christian name. It bears its Chaldean origin on its very forehead. Easter is nothing else than Astarte, one of the titles of Beltis, the queen of heaven...The worship of Bel and Astarte was very early introduced into Britain, along with the Druids, 'the priests of the groves'...That month [April] among our pagan ancestors having been called Easter-month..."
(Alexander Hislop, "The Two Babylons," 1853)

"Traces in the early English literature of shadowy divinities such as Geat, EOSTRE, Hreda and Seaxnet, who are not found in the medieval stories, indicate that Anglo-Saxon paganism may have been as rich and diverse as that of the southern and western European peoples." (Richard Hutton, "The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles," 1991)

"We Germans to this day call April Ostermonat, and Ostermanoth is found as early as Eginhart...Ostara, like the [Anglo-Saxon] Eastre, must in the heathen religion have denoted a higher being, whose worship was so firmly rooted, that the Christian teachers tolerated the name, and applied it to one of their own grandest anniversaries [Conf. Ideler's Chronologie, I, 516]. All the nations bordering on us have retained the Biblical 'pascha'...The OHG adv. 'ostar' expresses movement toward the rising sun...and probably an [Anglo-Saxon] eastor...[But] the High German and Saxon tribes seem on the contrary to have formed only an Ostara, Eastre (fem.), not Ostaro, Eastra (masc.)...Ostara, Eastre seems therefore to have been the divinity of radiant dawn..."
(Jacob Grimm, "Teutonic Mythology")

Grimm cites Bede, and argues that it would be absurd to conclude that Bede made up an English goddess!

Bede (672-735), in his "De Tempore Ratione" ("On the Reckoning of Time"), teaches that the word "Easter" is derived from "Eostre," the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring. The month of "Eosturmonath" (April) was dedicated to this goddess. Bede writes:

"In olden time the English people - for it did not seem fitting to me that I should speak of other nations' observance of the year and yet be silent about my own nation's - calculated their months according to the course of the moon. Hence after the manner of the Greeks and the Romans, [the months] take their name from the moon, for the moon is called mona and the month monath...The first months, which the Latins call January, is Giuli [Yule]; February is called Solmonath; March [is called] Hrethmonath; April [is called] EOSTURMONATH...EosturmonathÃ¢â‚¬Â¦was once called after a goddess of theirs named EOSTRE, in whose honor feasts were celebrated in that month...'"

"The English name Easter, and the German Ostern, are derived from the name of the Teutonic goddess Ostera (Anglo-Saxon Eostre), whose FESTIVAL was celebrated by the ancient Saxons with peculiar ceremonies in the month of April, and for which, as in many other instances, the first Roman Catholic missionaries substituted the paschal feast."
(Samuel Fallows, "Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia," 1912)

"Baeda [Bede in] Temp. Rat. xv. derives the word from Eostre (Northumb. spelling of Eastre), the name of a goddess whose festival was celebrated at the vernal equinox; her name shows that she originally was the dawn goddess."
("Oxford Dictionary")

Easter was therefore a spring festival celebrated by pre-Christian, Germanic tribes in dedication to the goddess Ostara:

"Easter, according to the Venerable Bede, is derived from Eostre, the name of a goddess worshipped of old in Britain. He lived sufficiently near to the time of idolatry to be able to speak with certainty, and no writer has given greater diligence to ensure accuracy." (J.H. Blunt, "Dictionary of Doctrinal and Historical Theology," 1892)

"It is called Easter in the English, from the goddess Eostre, worshipped by the Saxons with peculiar ceremonies in the month of April." ("Encyclopedia Britannica," 1771)

Modern pagans still hold a ritual sacrifice to the goddess Eostre or Ostara in April.

"Easter is a word of Saxon origin, and imports a goddess of the Saxons [Estera]...in honor or whom sacrifices being annually offered about the Passover time of the year (spring)...we say Easter-day, Easter-Sunday, but very improperly...So the present German word for Easter, Ostern, is referred to the same goddess, Estera or Ostera (Calmet)."
(M'Clintock and Strong, "Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Cyclopedia," 1890)

"The English Easter and the German equivalent Ostern, are derived from the Anglo-Saxon Ostara or Eastre, the name of the goddess of spring and the dawn (cf. 'Skeat's Etymological Dictionary'; Bede, 'De ratione temporum,' xv.)..."
("The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," 1909)

'The English term 'Easter' is of pagan origin."
(A.H. Newman, "A Manual of Church History," 1904)

"Easter is a heathen term, derived from the Saxon goddess Eastre, the same as Astarte, the Syrian Venus, called Ashtoreth in the O.T."
(E.W. Bullinger, "The Companion Bible," p.1607)

======================================================
Spring Was Dedicated to Goddess Worship in Roman Times
======================================================

Robert Turcan, in, "The Gods of Ancient Rome" (2001), notes:

"From [the] 12 to 19, Cere's games (Cerialia) were celebrated with chariot races...on the last day (19) of the Cerialia, foxes were released in the Circus Maximus, with lighted firebrands on their backs...On the whole, April ritualized Femininity..."

This festival in honor of the Roman goddess Ceres involved fertility rites and grain sacrifices. Ceres was the goddess of cereal, fruit and grains. The Roman procession of Ceres was preceded by an egg!:

"Ceres - In Roman mythology, the goddess of agriculture. She and her daughter Proserpine were the counterparts of the Greek goddesses Demeter and Persephone. The Greek belief that her joy at being reunited with her daughter each spring caused the earth to bring forth an abundance of fruits and grains was introduced into Rome in the 5th century BC, and her cult became extremely popular, especially with the plebeians. The word cereal is derived from her name. Her chief festival, the Cerealia, was celebrated from April 12 to 19." (http://www.ancientcoins.biz/pages/gods/indexbf.php)

Hislop writes:

"It is usually admitted that Isis was the original Greek and Roman CERES. But Ceres, be it observed, was worshipped not simply as the discoverer of corn; she was worshipped as the mother of corn. The child she brought forth was...'the seed.'...The Druids were devoted worshippers of Ceres."
("The Two Babylons")

It is noteworthy that the last day of the Spring-goddess festival was celebrated with bon-fires in ancient Rome. Grimm documents a similar burning of the "ostermann" in Germany. He writes:

"Bon-fires were lighted at Easter."

It therefore appears that the ancient Spring festival to the goddess (Venus, Ceres, etc.) was celebrated in a similar fashion in ancient Britain. In Britain, this festival was called "Eostre" (Easter), after the Saxon version of the same goddess, Ceres, etc. "Easter," therefore, would be the exact translation for Herod's pagan festival; and it is also possible that he viewed the Jewish Passover as simply the same pagan celebration of fertility and life. Do any imagine that Herod had holy views or holy insight in regard to the Jewish Passover? Certainly he would view this festival as simply a strange addition to his own pagan celebrations. To Herod, the Passover was likely an extension of Easter, the festival or spring-time-period dedicated to the goddess of fertility and grain, etc.

==================================================================
Some Evidence That The Word Easter May Not Be Of Pagan Derivation
==================================================================

Some earlier English Bible versions used the word "Easter" as a synonym for Passover (i.e. the Bishop's Bible of 1568; Tyndale's Version of 1534, etc.). Wycliff, in 1380 used the word "pask" in Acts 12.

What then is the etymology of "Easter"? Some have argued that the word simply means "the dawn" or "the rising." The AV also freely uses the word "east" (also associated with the rising sun), and we do not believe the Translators used any pagan words.

"Blount's Dictionary" of 1656 reveals that even in his early day there was some disagreement among skilled linguists as to the etymology of the word "Easter":

"...the Feast of Easter, so named of Eoster, a Goddess of the old Saxons, whose Feast they kept in April... Mynshew derives Easter from East, our Sun of Righteousness did rise, as the Sun in the East...Verstegan says Easter, was by the old Saxons, called Oster..."

John Minsheu (1560-1627), mentioned by Thomas Blount, above, was an English lexicographer and instructor of languages in London. His, "The Guide into Tongues" (1617), was one of the first, serious etymological dictionaries.

===================
Conclusion
===================
Regardless of "Easter's" etymology (and I intend to continue researching the issue), the AV is correct. And we should be sure to shun both the Easter of Rome and the Easter of blatant paganism (which is reviving in the New Age movement).

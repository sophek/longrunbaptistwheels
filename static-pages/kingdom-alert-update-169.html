THE COMING REBUILT TEMPLE: PREMILLENNIAL INTERPRETATION TO BE VINDICATED - AGAIN!
"Over half of all Israeli Jews would like to see the building of a third temple, according to a survey commissioned by the Reform movement's Israel Religious Action Center....According to the survey, conducted by the Dahaf Institute, a total of 53 percent of the 775 people queried said that they would like a third temple erected on the Temple Mount. These included some 87% of religious and haredi respondents and 64% of those who described themselves as traditional, but it also included 63% of respondents from the former Soviet Union, as well as most of those of Middle Eastern origin and those of Western origin aged 18 to 35. Only among older respondents of Western origin did a majority, 53%, not want to see the Temple rebuilt..." (Jerusalem Post, July 20, 2002)

Currently, in the latest edition of the Jerusalem Post, it reads: "A new poll found half of Israelis want the Third Temple to be built. Do you?" 81% responded with "Yes." Remember that religious Jews have long predicted that their temple would be literally rebuilt:

"Rabbi Levy, of Tresmont Temple, New York, says: - 'The Temple at Jerusalem will be rebuilt, or possibly the Mosque of Omar which now stands upon that site, will simply be cleansed and rededicated to Jehovah; for according to the strictest Jewish Law, any place of worship may be transformed into a Jewish synagogue or Temple by removing all idols, and rededicating it to the God of Israel.'" (D.M. Panton, "The Dawn Magazine," Aug. 15th, 1924)

"Rabbi L. J. Schwefel, lecturing in Denver a few weeks ago for the Jewish National Fund of America, said: 'Eventually the TEMPLE of Solomon will be built in Palestine." (D.M. Panton, "The Dawn Magazine," 1935)

God will use the popular unbelief and rejection of Jesus among the Jews to fulfill His tribulation prophecies. The fact that over half of those polled long for a rebuilt temple reveals that the climate of opposition is changing.

Early adversaries of premillennialism scoffed at the doctrine of a restored nation of Israel, and especially of a rebuilt temple. But the future has already begun to laugh at these scoffers when in 1948, Israel was restored! These teachers sought to limit God's plain, prophetic words to the figurative sense, in spite of the literal fulfillments of many Old Testament prophecies during the first coming of Christ. Will not the remaining prophecies be likewise fulfilled in a literal sense? The fact that many prophecies can also receive a figurative application (when justified by the New Testament) does not mean that they are LIMITED to a figurative fulfillment. Israel has been restored as a nation in unbelief, setting the stage for events in the future tribulation period, exactly as the Bible predicts (Revelation 11:8, Matthew 24:16, Ezekiel 37:12-14, Daniel 11:30-32, Daniel 9:27, etc.). And now, as we see the signs of a rebuilt temple on the horizon, we must not forget the scoffing words of those who have decried the premillennial interpretation. We must firmly learn a lesson, and use this lesson to help weaker brothers and sisters resist the modern attacks of preterism and postmillennialism upon God's literal prophecies. As we see the stage being set to literally fulfill the temple prophecies, let us also remember the keen words of premillennialists of earlier times.

Early Premillennialists Predict the Restoration of Israel and a Rebuilt Temple

This list could seemingly go on endlessly. For now, the sample list will prove very enlightening and encouraging in our day, as we begin to see hope for the temple ignited in the Jews.

Irenaeus, in the 2nd century, writes:

"Besides he has pointed out, which in many ways I have shown, that the TEMPLE in Jerusalem was made by the direction of the true God. For the apostle himself, speaking in his own person, distinctly calls it the temple of God...in which temple the adversary shall sit, trying to show himself off as Christ." (Contra Haeres, V. 25, 2, 4)

Cyril of Jerusalem in the 4th century, wrote:

"But this aforesaid Antichrist is to come when the times of the Roman empire shall have been fulfilled, and the end of the world is now drawing near....the Antichrist, who by his magical craft shall seize upon the Roman power....seateth himself in the temple of God.' What temple then? He means, the TEMPLE of the Jews which has been destroyed. For God forbid that it should be the one in which we are!" (Lecture 15, paragraphs 9,12,15).

Theodoret of Cyprus, in the 5th century, wrote:

â€œThe Antichrist will not only pronounce himself highest of the false gods, but will sit in the TEMPLE of God, as if he were God ....the Jews, who did not want to believe in the Lord, as though He were an adversary to God, will believe in the Antichrist who will pronounce himself to be the god of all.â€ (Commentary on 2 Thessalonians)

In the 1883, William Burgh wrote:

"....the Jewish people will be found re-embodied as a nation...the greater portion of the Jewish nation will return to their land in a state of unbelief; that they WILL REBUILD THEIR CITY AND THEIR TEMPLE, and that God will choose that time to consummate His judgments on them: - that He will bring an host of invading armies against them, who will besiege their city..." (Commentary on Rev. Ch. 7, "Apocalypse Unfulfilled")

In the mid-1800's, Robert Govett wrote:

"It is taken for granted that the Roman destruction of Jerusalem under Titus, did not fulfill the Savior's prophecy on Olivet; that the Jews will shortly return to their land unbelief; that they will rebuild the TEMPLE and offer sacrifices..."
("The Saints' Rapture")

In 1861, Robert Govett wrote:

"The temple in Jerusalem will be yet rebuilt by the Jews in unbelief, and be the scene of wickedness greater than has ever appeared...While then the temple had been destroyed at the date of the writing of the Revelation, it was hereby predicted that it would be rebuilt...Till the Jew is brought back to his own land, and the temple and its sacrifices are restored, the prophetic part of the Apocalypse does not begin."
("The Apocalypse: Expounded By Scripture", pp.497, 501)

B.W. Savile, in 1858, wrote:

"There are passages in the Old Testament where a TEMPLE is alluded to, as existing at a time yet future, when the Jews are called upon to undergo that trial, which is described in the twelfth chapter of Daniel, and the fourteenth chapter of Zechariah, but previous to the Millennial Temple....It is reasonable to conclude that there must be a temple in which these things will occur....That such a temple will exist (it may be that the present Mosque of Omar, which stands on the site of Solomon's Temple, will be used for this purpose, though not necessarily owned by God, upon the restoration of the Jews in unbelief, to the land of their fathers....they cannot attempt to offer sacrifices as long as they are excluded from Jerusalem....in this temple, built by the Jews in unbelief, there will be a similar attempt to pollute it by setting up an idol...."

Andrew Bonar wrote:

"With the restoration to their land is inseparably associated the rebuilding of the TEMPLE and renewal of sacrifices there. For this express purpose a subscription has been already begun among many of the wealthiest of them, particularly in America, to erect a building like 'the holy and beautiful house' of their fathers..."

Joseph Seiss in 1865 wrote:

"What, then, is the implication, but that when this period is once reached, Jerusalem will have been largely repopulated by the children of its ancient inhabitants, its TEMPLE rebuilt, and its ancient worship restored. God is not done with the Jews as a distinct people. In their half-faith and 'blindness in part,' they will seek and find their way back to a revival of their ancient metropolis, TEMPLE, and ritual." ("Lectures on the Apocalypse", Vol.III)

David Lord (1792-1880) wrote:

"Those who assent to the true laws of language and symbols will no more deny or doubt that the prophecies teach that the Israelites are to be restored, than those who assent to the definitions and axioms of geometry will deny the demonstrations that are founded on them. There is not a proposition in the whole circle of human knowledge of more perfect certainty than that God has revealed the purpose of re-gathering that scattered nation, establishing them as his chosen people, and re-appointing a TEMPLE worship at Jerusalem that is to embrace some of their ancient rites."

C.J. Goodhart, in 1879, wrote:

"The unbelieving Jews will have built themselves a TEMPLE, in which it is my full persuasion the idol infidel Antichrist will be set up and worshipped."
(Mildmay Conference)

Baptist writer, James R. Graves in 1883, wrote:

"There will be a large number of Jews with a flourishing city and an organized government occupying Jerusalem before the Advent, with whom 'the Antichrist' will make an alliance....My proof is - Since it is admitted by all - because it has been demonstrated by fulfillment, that all the prophecies in the Scriptures, Old and New, which relate to the destruction of their city and TEMPLE and their dispersion among the nations, has been literally fulfilled, therefore all those Scriptures which relate to their Restoration must, likewise, be interpreted literally." ("The Work of Christ Consummated in Seven Dispensations")

In 1905 Ford C. Ottman wrote:

"Israel's restoration involves, as we have already seen, the restoration of temple service."
("The Unfolding of the Ages," p.264)

In 1914, Walter Scott wrote:

"The Jews as a nation are restored in unbelief...They then proceed to build their temple, and restore, so far as they can, the Mosaic ritual..."
("Exposition of the Revelation of Jesus Christ," p.228)

In 1919, Clarence Larkin wrote:

"The Temple that the Jews will build on their return to Jerusalem will probably be destroyed by the Earthquake..."
("The Book of Revelation," pp.84-85)

In 1932, English Baptist writer, D.M. Panton, wrote:

"It is not revealed (so far as we know) exactly when and how the TEMPLE will be restored; but an exceedingly suggestive proposal is advanced by Dr. Marium Ranson, director of the American Synagogue of New York. He forecasts the removal of the World Court from The Hague to Jerusalem, the erection of a new temple on the site of King Solomon's ancient temple to house the World Court, and the development of a 'higher Zionism' by Jews, Christians and Mohammedans, as three steps in an international program for world peace. This (as we see at once) would change the hostility of Islam into co-operation, so solving the problem of the Mosque of Omar; procure the aid of the Masons of the world, who back peace for financial reasons, and whose whole system is steeped in apocryphal traditions of the Temple; create friendliness in the Christian Mandatory Power; and by centering in it the judicial and political power of the world, make the Palestinian Temple the goal of the ambitions of the Antichrist." ("The Dawn Magazine," January 15, 1932)

In another article in 1932, D.M. Panton wrote:

"Who exactly rebuilds the TEMPLE - whether it is reconstructed internationally, or by Zionists, or by the Masons of the world, or by the Mandatory Power - does not appear to be revealed, but since the sacrifices could be offered nowhere else, and Antichrist makes the sacrifices, which had been resumed, to cease (Dan.ix.27), the Temple must be again in being for the final drama, and it is the Temple of God. Our Lord regarded Herod's Temple as 'My Father's House' (John ii.16), though built by an actual forerunner of the Apostates (Ps.ii.2; Acts iv.25) who are to rebuild it again, and by a crucifier of the Messiah."

In 1935, D.M. Panton wrote:

"Israel's agelong apostasy can only ripen to its close. The vast resurgence of the Jew to Palestine which all the world is watching can...have but one certain goal - a rebuilt TEMPLE." ("The Dawn," Dec. 1935)

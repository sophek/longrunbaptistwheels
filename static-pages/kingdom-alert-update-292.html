HUMANISTIC SERMONS: A ROTTEN FRUIT OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
(Examining a Sunday Sermon from Broadway Baptist Church, Fort Worth, TX)
**********************************************************************
Charles F. Potter wrote in 1930:

"Protestantism...is disintegrating...salvation from sin through the vicarious [substitutionary] sacrifice of Christ on Calvary is losing its appeal today...[Our] Humanism challenges a man to quit leaning on the everlasting arms...Salvation by grace still remains in the creeds and hymns, but IN THE SERMONS one hears more about SALVATION BY SERVICE...It is probable that the next great humanistic culture will develop in America...It may be that east and west will find their meeting-place in the religion of Humanism...Perhaps Jesus was as much of a Humanist as anyone in his environment could have been. But Paul was not, and Christian theology has historically followed Paul rather than Jesus...We have too long explained Jesus theologically. The time has come to study him psychologically...A new faith for the new age is what we want, and Humanism is that faith...So very humanistic is MODERN EDUCATION that NO RELIGION HAS A FUTURE UNLESS IT BE HUMANISM..."
("Humanism: A New Religion," 1930)

Potter (a past president of the National Association of Education) rejoiced at the realization that the U.S. government had instituted PUBLIC EDUCATION as the new Humanistic "state church" in America! He boasted that this influence would soon over-ride the influence of traditional, Sunday churches, and even begin to TRANSFORM THEM into Humanistic churches:

"All religions today are becoming humanistic and tomorrow they will be more so...there is no stopping it...It is in America that the destinies of the world are being shaped...Rev. E. Stanton Hodgin...in a sermon in the volume 'Humanistic Sermons' edited by Dr. Reese...said: 'Our nation...disestablished the church...In place of the church that it had disestablished, it established THE SCHOOL, giving it state aid and authority...[making it] the bulwark of national security and stability...'...[E]very American public school is a school of Humanism. What can the theistic Sunday-schools, meeting for an hour once a week, and teaching only a fraction of the children, do to stem the tide of a five-day program of humanistic teaching?"
("Humanism: A New Religion," 1930)

If this was the state of things in 1930, we should not be surprised to hear of schools today providing detailed, explicit "education" in homosexual perversion (i.e. Maryland, etc.).

In past articles, I proved that public education in America was founded and influenced by the Unitarians. Many of these Unitarians (already heretical enough) soon became the Religious Humanists of the 20th century (i.e. Potter) - and they were still in control of the educational system. Although many early Christians (with Baptists leading the way) were able, by God's grace, to secure the First Amendment and prohibit government established religion, it was not long before public education became the new Golden Calf! This new, established "church" was given a free pass to indoctrinate millions of children since it walked in the name of "education." In a similar fashion, the new religion of psychology (simply another face of Humanism) was given a free pass since it walked in the name of "science." It appears that many Christians forgot the warnings of the Bible about wolves in sheep's clothing, and "science falsely so called" (Matthew 7:15, 1 Timothy 6:20). As can be discerned by the above quotes, the goal of Humanism from the beginning was to finally establish a new religion in America, and the world.

The same Religious Humanism that has justified itself for so long under the names of "secular education" and "science," now finds it just as easy to walk under the banner of "progressive Christianity." How successful has this plan been in America? It has been extremely successful. Many churches in America have become Humanistic churches. Humanism enters the pulpits through "Christian psychology," "positive thinking," "the emerging church," "relating to seekers," "being relevant," etc. Indeed, Religious Humanism in the churches (nicely decorated with Christian terminology) attracts multitudes of Americans each Sunday. The early Religious Humanists predicted that they would soon have this degree of influence upon the churches.

Many Christians vainly thought that they would be able to influence the "secular" schools (and the children - the future generations) by their 30-minute "sermonettes" each Sunday. Instead, the Religious Humanists smirked and watched as the churches of America were quickly transformed (in varying degrees) into man-centered, Humanistic, social play-houses! They had the children! These Christians made the mistake of letting "Pharaoh" keep their children behind while they went out into the "wilderness" to play church. Moses was not so gullible (Exodus 10:10-11).

Infidels in the late 19th century predicted that, before long, a new church "without walls" would arise in America that would be based upon so-called "deeds of love," instead of Biblical creeds, doctrine, faith, etc. The Religious Humanists, thirty years later, agreed, and boasted that the seeds they were sowing in public education would break forth in a Humanistic harvest that would so engulf the country that Christian churches would feel the pressure to change just to keep their doors open. What the Religious Humanists did not realize was that the Bible, 2000 years ago, predicted that in the last days men will be lovers of themselves (2 Timothy 3); and that many believers will not endure sound doctrine as they heap to themselves teachers (2 Timothy 4), who will promise a sinful liberty in order to make merchandise of them (2 Peter 2).

The following quotes are unbelievable and saddening. Yet, I assure you, this is not satire. The church is "Broadway Baptist Church" in Fort Worth, Texas. The pastor is Brett Younger. Mr. Younger preached a sermon on September 10, 2006 called "The Gospel According to Jesus." ( <a href="http://www.broadwaybc.org/sermons/index.html#top" target="_blank">http://www.broadwaybc.org/sermons/index.html#top</a> )

He tells of a time, as a teenager, when he was "soul winning" (i.e. door-knocking) in Ohio with an older, more experienced man. They entered the home of a lady who had been abandoned by her husband:

"...he quickly launched into the presentation, which he'd learned well. He started with Romans 3:23...Then Romans 6:23...Ephesians 2:10...Romans 5:8...I should point out I don't actually remember all of this. I still have my big green workbook."

The woman did not accept the Gospel presentation. Young then says:

"But now I wonder if we got the story right. What is the gospel? Most of the time Christians quote the apostle Paul - statements about justification by grace through faith and Christ being a substitutionary sacrifice for our sin. It sounds right, but then you have to wonder why Jesus didn't talk about that stuff. Shouldn't Jesus be the one who tells us what the gospel is? The message Jesus preached wasn't what I was taught about salvation....Jesus came to start a political, social, religious, artistic, economic, intellectual, and spiritual revolution that would change the world. Jesus is fascinating, mysterious, uncontainable, uncontrollable, surprising, stunning, dazzling and explosive. Jesus didn't preach a plan to avoid hell...More than anything else, Jesus preached the kingdom...To live for the kingdom is to be a little out of one's mind...Brian McLaren suggests that in order to grasp the wonder of the kingdom it might be helpful to think in other terms...What about the dream of God?...Or the revolution of God?...The party of God?...The gospel is not believing facts about God, it's believing God will change your life and change the world."

Brian McLaren is a leader in the "Emerging Church" movement. It is Humanism laced with some eastern mysticism in Christian dress. Mr. Younger's sermon is a good example of where everything is heading in this final falling away. Eternity, the Millennium, the Judgment Seat of Christ, and the Second Coming must all be pushed aside for a contemplative "kingdom within" in the present. Salvation is presented as only an experience in this life. Salvation lies within man. This is the same "Humanistic gospel" of men like Charles Potter (Dewey, Fromm, etc.). Potter writes:

"Probably we shall be as near the truth as may be if we assert that the religion of Jesus was Theism with a humanistic flavor. It is well illustrated in a statement of his [Jesus] which did not get into the canonical gospels but which was discovered not long ago in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus:

'and the kingdom of heaven is within you, and whosoever shall know himself shall find it - (strive therefore) - to know yourself and ye shall be aware that ye are the sons of the Father.'"
("Humanism: A New Religion," 1930)

Certainly, there are some compromised churches that have not yet fully fallen into this old, Satanic Gnosticism. However, their ear-scratching emphasis on obtaining riches, with positive-thinking, self-image, self-esteem, self-worth, self-discovery, self-significance, self-love, etc., drinks from the same Humanistic cess-pool. It is found in the words of the Serpent in Genesis 3. The Bible teaches that it is the religion of fools:

ProverbsÃ‚Â 18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may DISCOVER ITSELF.

These Religious Humanists portray Fundamental Christians as always gazing at the clouds with no practical love or concern for people, or for doing any good in the world. With this type of presentation, modern young people are easily led astray. While we must reject the "social gospel" of these hypocrites (for multiple reasons), let us indeed shine our light before men, that they may see our good works, and glorify God. Let us prove all things by the Holy Scriptures. And please, pull your children out of the mouth of the Serpent before it is too late!

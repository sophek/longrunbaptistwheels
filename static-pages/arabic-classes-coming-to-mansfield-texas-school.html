Parents are upset that the school received a government grant but the intentions to teach Arabic language, culture and religion, was hidden for some time. Others are vexed that schools are permitted to teach Islam but not Christianity. The truth of the matter is that parents should not be relying on the state to teach their children. God never gave any parent the right to give their children to the state for an indoctrination into Humanism. To see the real intentions behind the public school system in America, read Charles F. Potterâ€™s â€˜Humanism: A New Religionâ€ (1930). Your eyes will be opened to the real agenda and purpose, and you will see that the Godless state of America has been planned.

Unless the foundation of the fear of God is restored, what can the righteous do? (Psalms 11:3, 111:10). We believe it is high time to realize that many Christians in modern times made a dreadful mistake in discarding the warnings that the Lord ordained for us. It is for this reason that we are gathering together as many as we can, who will fear the Lord and seek first His kingdom and righteousness, for the purpose of encouraging and emboldening the saints in these forgotten truths. Why not join us? The Devil does not want you to attend. He wants the "word of the Kingdom" choked by the cares and pleasures of this life (Mt. 13), or discarded due to the fear of men. Press on through any obstacles, and take the roof off (Mark 2), and we trust the Lord will make a way for us to fellowship together, June 24th-27th. (See detailed schedule online).

ISAAC WATTS ON UNWATCHFUL CHRISTIANS:

Isaac Watts (1674-1748) was an English pastor, author, poet and hymn-writer. He is known as the "Father of English Hymnody." He was one of the most popular writers of his age. He had some wrong views (e.g., he was confused on the Trinity; and he sometimes interpreted some Scriptures dealing with the coming of the Lord, and His earthly reign, as if they dealt with death and Heaven - though often he interpreted these in a dual or double sense). However, he also had some precious rays of truth that often shined forth in his writings or hymns - especially concerning the despised, but needful, doctrine of Christian accountability.

Whitefield, Edwards, and other revivalists helped popularize Watt's hymns in America. Some of his most famous hymns are, "Alas! and did My Saviour Bleed?," "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross," "I Sing the Mighty Power of God," and, "Am I a Soldier of the Cross?" This last hymn stresses accountability for the Christian. We certainly need more of this today! Notice the words of this popular hymn:

"Am I a soldier of the cross,
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His Name?

And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown!
And when the battle's over
We shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem

Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery BEDS OF EASE,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?"

In "Hymn 518," Watts writes on the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Parable of the Talents:

"...And never stand still till our Master appear! His adorable will let us gladly fulfill, and our Talents improve...Our life as a dream, our time as a stream, glides swiftly away...The Millennial year, rushes on to our view...O that each in the day of His coming may say, 'I have fought my way through; I have finished the work Thou didst give me to do!' O that each from HIS LORD may receive the glad word, 'Well and faithfully done! Enter into My joy, and sit down on My throne.'"

In his book, "The World to Come," Watts writes:

"Judgment is making haste towards us; months and days of Divine patience are flying swift away, and the last great day is just at hand; then we must give an account of all that has been done in the body, whether it has been good or evil; 2 Cor. v. 10. and what a dismal and distressing surprise will it be to have the Judge come upon us in a blaze of glory and terror, while we have no good account to give at his demand!...A Dreadful account must be given of all this lost and wasted time. When the Judge shall ascend his throne in the air...'Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when he cometh shall find watching'...well-chosen are those parables, whereby our Saviour gave warning to his disciples, that when he was departed from this world they should ever be upon their guard, and always in a readiness to receive him at his return; because he would come on a sudden and in such an hour as they thought not, to demand an account of their behaviour, and to distribute his recompences according to their works...these words in their supreme and most important sense always point to the glorious appearance of Christ at the last day, when he shall come to shut up all the scenes of this frail life, to put an end to the present world...And remember this, that if we are unprepared to meet the Lord at death, we can never be ready when he comes to judgment...even Christians may be found slumbering in other respects, and expose themselves to painful evils if that hour surprise them at unawares....

Such unwatchful Christians have not kept the eternal glories of heaven in their constant and active pursuit, they have not lived upon them as their portion and inheritance, they have been too much strangers to the invisible world of happiness, and they know not how to venture through death into it...'My talents have lain bound up in rust, or been but poorly employed whilst I have lain slumbering and inactive: the records of my life in the court of heaven will shew but very little service for God amongst men: I have raised few monuments of praise to my Redeemer, and I can never raise them now. I shall have but few testimonies for my love and zeal...when the martyrs and the confessors and the lively Christians shall be surrounded with the living-ensigns of their victories over sin and the world, and their glorious service for their Redeemer. Wretch that I am! that I have...lain slumbering on a bed of ease whilst I should have been fighting the battles of the Lord, and gaining daily honours for my Saviour!...blessed is the watchful Christian; he shall be found amongst the over-comers, and shall partake of the rich variety of divine favours which are contained in the epistles to the seven churches. Rev. ii. and iii...Even the lawful satisfactions of flesh and sense, and the enticing objects round about us may attach our hearts so fast to them as to draw us down into A BED OF CARNAL EASE..."

 

THOUGHTS ON DEMAS THE BACKSLIDER

Colossians 4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

Philemon 1:24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

2 Timothy 4:10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica...

What happened to Demas? The Bible is clear. He fell BACK in love with this present world, and took his eyes off the world to come. He became a backslider:

Proverbs 14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways...

From Paul (and God's) perspective, it is very clear what happened to Demas. But have you ever thought about how Demas viewed it? Do you think he knew that he was a backslider? Perhaps he deceived himself. Sin can deceive us, as we partake of worldliness. We can become gradually hardened:

Hebrews 3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

I have seen this happen to some people over the years. I barely recognize them. They talk differently. Their jesting is immature and worldly. They lack sobriety. They become effeminate, puffed up, sarcastic, and bitter. Their standards begin to disappear. They spend some time in the lukewarm, middle place, trying to pretend that all is well. They would have people believe that they are "free." They speak in lofty, spiritual terminology. But it is only the last "kick" before they cross the line back to their vomit. They end up right back where they began.

But if you asked Demas what he thought about things, he would likely tell you that things are great now. He has discovered that Paul was a legalist, or he was too uptight. This is what got him hated by everyone. This is why he is in jail. Demas has learned a better way. He can have enjoy the world he left behind and still be "spiritual."

Poor Demas. Like the proverbial frog, things are about to get really hot (in a bad way). The modern Demas probably began his sad journey into the old land of his former vomit by loving the Hollywood movies. Slowly, but surely, he began to endure things that he would have formerly appalled. And before long, he began to enjoy them; even laugh at them, and want to share them. As Cain hated Abel, he begins to hate the class of Christians who preach and practice separation from "evil communications." There is a growing bitterness (dare he admit it?). It is like a breath of fresh air. What a joy he has been missing! How did he ever go without it. Like a glutton who has been on a diet, he begins to stuff himself with all manner of worldly enticements (especially if he can justify theme on the basis of some religious or spiritual themes).

So long Demas! Who would have ever believed it? You were doing so well. You don't even look the same.

Demas thinks of Paul in his dark dungeon. What a sad life, he reasons. A narrow pit for a narrow-minded person! Demas has come to a place where he is now wiser than his teacher (at least in his own foolish eyes).

Will he ever admit to himself that he is nothing but a backslider? Will he ever realize that all backsliders feel and reason like he does? Will he ever awake from his drunken delusion before death or the coming of the Lord? Only God knows.

What is that? There is a gnawing pain. What is it? Demas doesn't know it is the Holy Spirit. Why does he want to cry? Does he miss the way it used to be? But now he is having fun. Quick. He must surround himself with other bitter people. Misery loves company. This will make him feel better. But what will they talk about? They will talk about Paul. They will talk about his madness. They will talk about the present world.

Demas, the word of the kingdom was choked in you. You choked it. You looked back, while your hand was to the plow. You looked back to Sodom. Suddenly there were new opportunities to return to the old country (Hebrews 11:15).

Demas was deceived. Demas will be judged at the appearing of the Lord, if he is not cut down beforehand:

1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

1 Peter 4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:

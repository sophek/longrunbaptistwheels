        <h1>ROME'S INTEREST IN JERUSALEM - KAU#090</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Zechariah 12:2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about...
3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people...

"What Rome is to the Catholic, what Mecca is to the Moslem, Jerusalem, in a similar sense, will become to the Jew..." (Rabbi Silverman, New York Times, March 13, 1924)

"The battle for Jerusalem is thus a religious conflict and not a political one." (Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok)

"The Pope, for example, is reported to have met the heads of three African states and, together, they decided Jerusalem should be international..." ("Shma Yisrael", 1975)

"Vatican Wants Role In Jerusalem Accord - ...the Vatican has a different vision for Jerusalem, long-held and so strongly felt that Pope John Paul II publicly reminded Camp David's powerbrokers of it during the talks. Urging all sides 'not to overlook the importance of the spiritual dimension of the city of Jerusalem,' John Paul repeated the Holy See's insistence that international oversight - 'a special statute, internationally guaranteed' - would best safeguard the city's holy sites and all its religions...the city is the main obstacle to peace in the region..." (CBS, Aug.1, 2000)

"The Palestinian Arabs claim priority of right, the Jews having been exiled from the land for centuries while they have occupied it, they are very jealous of the Jews, and have sworn to annihilate them. Behind them is the Papacy, Rome is the root of all the troubles in the near East working in secret...she is continually egging on the Mohammedans to discontent and rebellion...When the Arabs and Turks rise against the Jews of Palestine, they will proclaim a holy war...This entire defeat of Edom...will restore...all that is precious to the Jews, including the Temple site where now stands the Mosque of Omar; here they will build their temple, offer sacrifices, and here, a little later, the Man of Sin will set up his image for worship." (Rev. W.H. Whalley, 1923)

The above words by Whalley were spoken in 1923. Since that time, the Catholic/Arab alliance has only grown stronger against the Jews. Pope Paul VI refused to accept Israeli statehood. But many think that things have changed with Pope John Paul II. The Pope has certainly been pleased with the Oslo Peace Accord. The late Yitzchak Rabin agreed to forfeit parts of the historic Jewish homeland to the Arabs and essentially denied any "Biblical right" to possess the land. It was only at that time that the Vatican agreed to diplomatic relations with Israel. But the Vatican still does not recognize Jewish authority over all of Jerusalem. It would much rather have Jerusalem come under international control, as a step toward its own future control over Jerusalem. Notice Rome's newly signed agreement with the PLO:

"...Having reviewed the history and development of the relations between the Holy See and the Palestinian People, including the working contacts and the subsequent establishment - on October 26, 1994 - of official relations between the Holy See and the PLO...Calling for a peaceful solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict...on the basis of international law, relevant United Nations and its Security Council resolutions, justice and equity; Declaring that an equitable solution for the issue of Jerusalem, based on international resolutions, is fundamental for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East...Calling, therefore, for a special statute for Jerusalem, internationally guaranteed...This Agreement shall enter into force from the moment of its signature by the two Parties. Signed in the Vatican, fifteenth of February, 2000." (Basic Agreement Between the Holy See and the Palestinian Liberation Organization)

This agreement attacks the Jewish State's hold over Jerusalem. Israel maintains that no "international statute" is needed since it already guarantees Jerusalem's special nature as sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The Catholic Church is already given legal jurisdiction under Israeli law over its own institutions and assets in the Holy Land (i.e. Fundamental Agreement Between the Holy See and the State of Israel, December 30, 1993). Many Orthodox Jews, such as "The Temple Mount Faithful" decry this new Catholic/PLO agreement and recognize it as the rotten fruit of a long-term policy of Rome against the Jews:

"It is no accident that this covenant was signed one month before the Pope's visit to Israel. The agreement is part of the long-term policy of the Vatican against Israel ever since the State of Israel was founded. This is a continuation of the historical hostility of the Vatican against the Jewish people. The Jewish people in the exile, mainly in Europe, and later also in South America have been persecuted by the Popes and the Roman Catholic Church and many millions were killed in terrible ways during the Inquisition, the pogroms and, in our time, in the Holocaust when 6 million Jews were killed including 1.5 million children and babies. During the Holocaust the Pope did not even try to prevent this killing or even state that he was against it. He was silent. On the other hand, the leader of the PLO terrorist organisation, Yasser Arafat, continues, through this covenant, the long, bloody struggle of terror against Israel and Jews and his hands are covered in Jewish blood. His goal was, and still is, to destroy the State of Israel and bring another holocaust on the Jews in the land of Israel...The traditional anti-Israeli position of both these sides created this covenant...They joined forces against Israel and Jerusalem as the godly eternal capital of Israel...we are living in the greatest time in the history of Israel...Everyone is called on to come and see what God is doing for Israel in these great days - the last days as the prophets called them."

Hitler claimed that his treatment of the Jews was 'what the church had done for 1,500 years.' The Vatican had actually signed a concordat with Hitler. In light of this, with the ending of World War II, Rome was hungry to change its guilty image in regard to the Jews. It tried to do this with Vatican II. But Rome is a chameleon. It could speak softly to the Jew, but from the very beginning it has demanded the internationalization of Jerusalem. It recognizes no right for the Jews to rule the land given to them by God. From the UN debate of the Partition Plan in 1947, until the latest agreement with the PLO, it is clear that Rome wants to keep Jerusalem from Jewish control.

Arafat has recently appealed to the Pope to intervene and solve the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel ("Arafat Appeals to Pope," Reuters, Oct.23, 2000). The Palestinian leaders believe that "only a voice as respected as the Pope's could hope to diffuse Middle East tension." Arafat has also recently appealed to the United Nations to settle the situation by international force:

"(AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat personally appealed to the Security Council on Friday to deploy a U.N. force to protect Palestinian civilians, but Israel rejected any international involvement and won critical U.S. support...U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said the United States would oppose any force as long as Israel rejects it, arguing that the United Nations cannot authorize missions without the consent of the governments concerned. He stressed that the Palestinians had never discussed the proposal with Israel...Despite that veiled threat of a U.S. veto, the Palestinians said they were drafting a resolution authorizing a 2,000-strong, mobile U.N. protection force to be deployed in Palestinian territories and Jerusalem..." (Nov.10, 2000)

The goal behind these measures is more than just peace and safety. It is a quest to ultimately compromise Israel's control of Jerusalem.

Why does Rome desire Jerusalem? Is it simply so Catholics can have access to their holy sites? They have access already. The Pope recently visited these sites! Why didn't Rome call for the internationalization of Jerusalem when it was in the hands of Jordan from 1948-1967? It is obvious we must look for another motive.

Many Jewish Rabbis believe that the reason Rome is seeking the destruction of Israel is because it is afraid that Christianity itself is undermined by the rebirth of Israel as a nation. They claim that the "wandering Jew" is a necessity for Christianity, since it claims that the Jews were scattered from their land for rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. They believe the rebirth of Israel as a nation is threatening to Christianity. But this theory is certainly false. It confuses Catholicism with Biblical Christianity. The Bible not only predicted the scattering of the Jews (Luke 21:20,24), it predicts their regathering and presence as a nation in order to fulfill a multitude of future prophecies. Therefore, the presence of Israel as a nation in these last days is one of the greatest proofs of the Divine Authorship of the New Testament (Rev.7:4, Rom. 11:26).

One of the main reasons that Catholicism desires Israel to lose sovereign control of Jerusalem lies in the fact that Rome has stolen the promises to the literal descendents of Abraham and has applied them to herself in this age. When Israel has control of Jerusalem, too many people begin to question Rome's own legitimacy. It is too much evidence that the literal interpretation of the Scriptures is correct and Rome is immediately exposed as an usurper to Israel's promises. Catholics have been very worried lately about the many people leaving Catholicism as a result of evangelism by fundamental Christians. Since the RCC is not premillennial, it has no place for the present restoration of the nation of Israel in its theology. Therefore, the presence of Israel (in control of Jerusalem) is not a proof against premillennial Christianity; it is a proof against an apostate, harlot form of Christianity that has masqueraded itself as the Theocratic Kingdom of Israel!:

"Many generous-minded, kind-hearted people believe that in Roman Catholicism we have simply to do with one of the Christian denominations, but history demonstrates that Romanism is first and last political."
("Romanism: A Menace to the Nation," 1912)

Rome concerns herself with the kingdoms of this world (and always ultimately seeks to dominate them) because she thinks that she has replaced Israel; she believes the OT promises to literal Israel (concerning the future Millennium) belong to her in this age.

2 Thessalonians 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God SITTETH IN THE TEMPLE of God, shewing himself that he is God.

Revelation 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman SIT UPON A SCARLET COLOURED BEAST, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

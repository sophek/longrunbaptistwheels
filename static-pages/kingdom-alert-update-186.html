(Horace Mann)</P><BR>  <P>Public education is a relatively modern monster. Public school teachers were not certified in the U.S. until 1866. By 1900, "only 6 percent of all Americans had graduated from high school." ("When My Grandmother Was a Child," By Leigh W. Rutledge). Today, strict attendance is enforced by police officers! How did this system of public education arise in America? Why did Christians embrace it in the first place? </P><BR>  <P>An early argument given for public education (i.e. government-controlled, taxpayer-financed education) was that it insures that poor children will receive an education. Yet, home-schooling (the norm) had long proven itself to be successful in the New World. Famous men such as George Washington, John Adams, and James Madison were home-schooled. John Adams stated in 1765 (before the rise of public education): </P><BR>  <P>"All ranks and orders of our People are intelligent, are accomplished - a native of America, especially of New England, who cannot read and write is as rare a Phenomenon as a Comet." (Benson &amp; Gangel, 1983) </P><BR>  <P>Also, in early America, there were abundant charity schools, and good people were more than ready to help pay tuitions to private schools. But ignoring these facts, if the purpose behind the government-controlled public school movement was really so that poor children could be educated, why didn't supporters suggest that cities simply pay the tuition for the poor children to attend private schools? Everyone knows that the free market leads to a higher quality of goods and services. No, there was obviously a higher agenda. The idea of "helping the poor children" was simply bait. The main goal was an entire, social transformation through converting the populace to infidel UNITARIAN (i.e. "Christianized" humanism or modernism) doctrines:</P><BR>  <P></P><BR>  <P>"The one institution that the Unitarians decided could be used to carry out this formidable task was the public school. Their first organized effort was the campaign in 1818 to create public primary schools. Why only public schools and not private or charity schools? Because private schools were run and controlled by individuals who might have entirely different views concerning the nature of man....Only the public schools, controlled in Boston by the affluent Unitarian establishment, could become that secular instrument of salvation." (Samuel L. Blumenfeld, "N.E.A.: Trojan Horse In American Education," p.9-10)</P><BR>  <P>Harvard Unitarians, such as James G. Carter, believed that public education would save mankind from wars and woes. Horace Mann (1796-1859), also a Unitarian, is commonly called "the father of modern education." He helped establish the Massachusetts Board of Education in 1837. He became its first secretary, serving for eleven years:</P><BR>  <P>"It was expected that James G. Carter, who had worked almost single-handedly for years to improve public schools in Massachusetts, would become the board's first secretary. Instead, the board surprised everyone and chose Horace Mann." ("Horace Mann, Class of 1819," Brown.edu)</P><BR>  <P>He presided over the establishment of the first public "normal" school (in the U.S.) at Lexington in 1839. Unitarians, such as Mann, wanted to counteract the influence fundamental Christianity had upon the minds of a majority of American children. They laid the foundation for government control of education:</P><BR>  <P>"He [Mann] came forward now to assert that 'natural religion stands as pre-eminent over revealed religion as the deepest experience over the lightest hearsay,' and proposed to substitute, for the Christian influence which pervaded our whole educational institution, a system of 'philosophical and moral doctrines,' the prevalence of which would, in his view, 'produce a new earth at least, if not a new heaven.' Believing what is called the 'evangelical faith,' at that time ruling New England, to be in its influence derogatory to the character of God, and dwarfing and enslaving to the mind of man...Especially he conceived it his mission to overcome the 'foul spirit of orthodoxy,' so far as it entered the domain of the public schools, and this he believed to be 'the greatest discovery ever made by man.'....Stamping with the name of bigotry all religious views that did not coincide with his own, regarding orthodoxy as the great thraldom by which man was enslaved, he would introduce a system of Christian ethics and doctrine...constituting the basis of his theories and schemes of popular education, which meant nothing else than the substitution of natural religion for revealed. How far Mr. Mann succeeded in this attempt we may judge by the prevalence of the doctrines of so-called 'liberal theology' in the Eastern States, particularly in Massachusetts." ("Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature," 1890)</P><BR>  <P>Mann wrote:</P><BR>  <P>"Let the Common School be expanded to its capabilities, let it be worked with the efficiency of which it is susceptible, and nine tenths of the crimes in the penal code would become obsolete; the long catalogue of human ills would be abridged." (Horace Mann, "Common School Journal," January 1841) </P><BR>  <P>Many Christians clearly saw that Mann and the Unitarians were simply seeking to indoctrinate American children with their own heretical views. They opposed Mann's agenda. But other Christians (even fiery Protestants) ignored the prophetic warnings, and embraced the public school movement. For example, a few decades later, Fontaine Richard Earle (1831-1908), a Cumberland Presbyterian minister, stated that government education would produce a utopia.</P><BR>  <P>&nbsp;</P><BR>  <P>What was the reason that so many Christians would take this Satanic bait and madly thrust their children like "Gergesene swine" into a sea of Unitarian indoctrination? Most Christians were already enjoying the freedoms and blessings of republican government. What could move so many to allow the responsibility of education to be given to the state instead of the family, as ordained by God (Genesis 18:19, Deuteronomy 11:19)? There appeared to be a very good reason - at least, on the surface. </P><BR>  <P>The Catholic Church bitterly opposed the whole concept of public education. They wanted tax support for their own parochial schools. Along with the sword, Catholic schools had always been one of Rome's chief means of converting whole nations to Roman Catholicism. In regard to the public schools, Catholics protested the reading of the King James Version in the classroom. As an increasing number of Catholics immigrated to the U.S., many Christians felt that the new public schools were at least "generally Protestant" enough to save America from domination by Rome. To counter the Catholic opposition, and the parochial schools, many Christians blindly adopted the view that the public "common schools" were "non-sectarian." They failed to realize that "non-sectarian" was simply a propaganda phrase for the Unitarian Church with its humanistic, socialistic agenda. Therefore, to escape the "Assyrians" and "Mystery Babylon," Christians presumptuously and rashly surrendered their children to "Egypt" (i.e. Unitarian infidels):</P><BR>  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isaiah 30:1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: </FONT></P><BR>  <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 That walk to GO DOWN INTO EGYPT, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen</FONT> themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! </P><BR>  <P>3 Therefore shall the STRENGTH OF PHARAOH BE YOUR SHAME, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</P><BR>  <P>Although these prophecies have a literal fulfillment, they certainly apply morally to modern Christians (1 Corinthians 10:6). As in ancient days, the Devil raised up two enemies of God in the face of American Christians. The people of God, fleeing one enemy (i.e. Catholicism), foolishly embraced public education as the "white horse" that would usher in the "kingdom." </P><BR>  <P>Cults throughout history have often converted people to their organizations by simply revealing to them that Roman Catholics believe the doctrine of the Trinity. Their point was that if Rome believed something, it must be wrong. But why wouldn't ROME believe in a plurality of Persons in the Godhead? Rome sins in the opposite direction. She prays to and worships the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, Mary, and a whole multitude of saints and angels! The same mistake is committed by those who teach that because Catholics believe in punishment after death (their fable of Purgatory), that there can be NO chastisement at the Judgment Seat for carnal Christians (2 Corinthians 5:9-11). The Devil uses this ploy quite often (e.g. "Mormons knock on doors, therefore we must not do so in soul winning," etc.). Instead of checking the system of government-controlled education by the Scriptures, and asking counsel of the Lord, multitudes of Christians (especially postmillennialists) embraced the new system as the "savior"! They believed (against premillennial truth) that public education would put the last nail in the coffin of Roman Catholicism. The more the Catholics raged against it, the more they were sure that the government schools were white "horses" sent by the Lord Himself:</P><BR>  <P>Isaiah 31:1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!</P><BR>  <P>Jeremiah 2:13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</P><BR>  <P>18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor...</P><BR>  <P>19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee...</P><BR>  <P>23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim?...</P><BR>  <P>35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</P><BR>  <P>It is time for fundamental Christians to admit that they have sinned by trusting in the waters of Egypt to educate their children. Our country is presently bearing the shame of this historic sin:</P><BR>  <P>Jeremiah 2:37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him [Egypt], and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.</P><BR>  <P>Even a modern Roman Catholic writer suggests that the American Protestants were "outwitted" by Unitarians:</P><BR>  <P>"American Protestants, especially Baptists and Methodists, having used their religious liberty to split into many small sects which were unable or unwilling to conduct their own schools (or else were OUTWITTED by the Unitarians), generally adopted this new State school...." (Frank Brown, "Catholic Families And The Education Tax," 1996) </P><BR>  <P>Notice a common, Protestant defense of public education by Lansing in 1890:</P><BR>  <P>"Now with our politics, as embodied in the Constitution, our common schools are in direct accord...Now, Romanism is an absolute monarchy; it is a despotic from of government: its idea has always been that ignorance is the mother of devotion....While, therefore, the public schools are absolutely indispensable under our Constitution, such public schools are recognized by Rome as absolutely hostile to theirs...." (Isaac J. Lansing, "Romanism and the Republic," 1890)</P><BR>  <P>He argues that education is indispensable to a free republic. However, he fails to show why "education" is synonymous with "state" schools! He continues:</P><BR>  <P>"Against our common schools Rome is throwing all the weight of its power....You see, then, that their purpose, their explicit purpose, is to break down our system of common schools until the school buildings shall be deserted....The 'Freeman's Journal of November 20, 1869, says:...'The Catholic solution of this muddle about Bible or no Bible in the public schools is - hands off. No state taxation or donations for any schools. You look to your children, and we will look to ours...We don't want you to be taxed for Catholic schools; we don't want to be taxed for Protestant or godless schools. Let the public school system go to where it came from - the devil.' That is the New York 'Freeman's Journal,' of Nov. 20, 1869, one of the most respectable Catholic publications in America....If you are fair, says Rome, you will give up to us our schools, and you will help pay for them. If you love America, says the rising spirit of this country, you will save the schools, whatever the Pope says." (Isaac J. Lansing, "Romanism and the Republic," 1890)</P><BR>  <P>Lansing's words reveal that the system of public education was rashly supported by Christians because the Pope was against it. According to the rising spirit of the age, anyone who loved America should therefore love whatever the Pope hated. Yet, these men were in error for not discerning the vast difference between true education in general (i.e. private schools and home-schooling) and the "education" in Unitarian, humanistic, state-controlled "school-churches." It is impossible to teach subjects such as history and reading without religion. What do the students read as literature? How can true history be taught without offending various religious sects? Reading, writing, history and science taught without recognizing revealed religion (the inspired Bible) would simply be the religion of Unitarians, modernists, humanists, and Deists. To truly combat Roman Catholicism and temporarily avoid the future rise of Roman Catholic controlled public education, Christians should take their children out of the secular-humanist, Unitarian "churches," and do everything they can to encourage true education.</P><BR>  <P>Lastly, notice the following words from a "progressive" Roman Catholic priest named Jeremiah J. Crowley:</P><BR>  <P>"Catholic priests and prelates are determined to destroy the American public school....an institution which the American people rightfully regard as one of the greatest bulwarks of their liberties....Catholic publications are filled with articles and editorials which show most malignant hatred of the public school....Catholics have it dinned into their ears constantly that the 'education of children belongs to the parents and is foreign to the State,' and that parents cannot yield this right to the State....The logical effect of this assertion is to take the educating of the children of the land wholly from the State and place it entirely in the control of the parents of the children....This doctrine would give to the Mormon church, for example, the exclusive training and educating of all Mormon children....The right of the anarchist under this doctrine is as sacred as the right of the Mormon or of the Catholic....If parents insist upon rearing their children in ignorance, the State must enforce compulsory education....Having eliminated God from the public schools Catholic ecclesiastics then charged the public schools with being godless....What sort of a nation would we have if each sect educated its own children? Statistics show about 150 different denominations in the United States. Imagine the American public school abolished and each sect educating its own youth!...Two generations wholly educated in sectarian schools would mean the disruption of the United States....To bring all of the American children under the domination of sectarian schools would turn the United States towards the dark ages....There should be an authoritative National Supervision of the education of the children of the Nation both in public AND IN NON-PUBLIC SCHOOLS." (Crowley, "Parochial School: A Curse to the Church and a Menace to the Nation," 1912)</P><BR>  <P>Incredible words! His works were endorsed by many of the leading Protestants of his day. They certainly contained much truth. However, in his support of government-controlled education (and perfuming of socialism), he failed to mention that the system of free, parental education he sees as so dangerous to liberty gave rise to the very country he is professing to desire to save! Whether Crowley was a Jesuit plant, or simply a sincere seeker of truth confused in the area of education, matters little. The fact remains that fundamental Christians, encouraged by these shallow arguments for decades, freely surrendered their children to be "socially engineered" five days a week by a system that scorns fundamental Christianity. Let us repent.</P>

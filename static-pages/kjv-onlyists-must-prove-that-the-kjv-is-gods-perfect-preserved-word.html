            "KJV Onlyists must prove that the KJV is God's perfect, preserved Word."

Before looking at such proof, let us apply this to the KJV critic's own position. Let the KJV critic prove that God has decided to preserve His words imperfectly through a multitude of conflicting copies, versions, etc. The KJV critics will sometimes state that they believe that the words of God have indeed been perfectly preserved, yet they teach that no one can find them all at one time, and place them in one Book! It therefore follows, according to this view, that God's words are not preserved in any real sense! They are not preserved enough to read in one Book. The KJV critic does not believe a person can read, from Genesis to Revelation, every perfect word of God that was found in the originals. How then can he call this "preservation"? Nevertheless, let the KJV critic prove his view of preservation. How will he do it? Will he use a bible that he claims is no longer 100% perfect?

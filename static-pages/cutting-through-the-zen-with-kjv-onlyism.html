        <h1>CUTTING THROUGH THE ZEN WITH KJV ONLYISM</h1>
        <div id="content">
            One learns much over the years through street witnessing. One Friday night in Dallas, a Christian who was also out witnessing, took a slight offense to our "KJV Onlyism". After our friendly debate, this man began demonstrating to us his method. As he began his discussion of the "Bible", some kids started gathering around. Immediately after listening to a few words, a rebellious kid shouted, "Which _____[sware word] Bible!?" Our friend, a bit shaken, replied that all the Christian Bibles were the same and that the young protestor should worry about such things at another time. All mocked.

On another occasion a Wiccan priest debated for quite a long time. As he gathered the many young zealous Christians around him, he stated in a devilish grin: "You do not even have a Bible! Have you read the back of a Ryrie Study Bible? Even your conservative scholars admit there is no perfectly preserved Bible without errors!"

We began to explain to this arrogant Wiccan that God has preserved His Bible and resurrected His Word in the universal language of these last days and that this perfect Bible proves him to be dead in trespasses and sins and in need of a Saviour.

What is going on? Anyone who has spent very much time witnessing will know that the unbelievers are laughing and mocking at the so-called "conservative" Christian stand for perfect original manuscripts that are not here anymore! If they do not become atheists, they develop a form of godliness having no respect for any final authority besides their own lusts. Why should they? If you were a teenager with temptations and you read in what you thought was God's Word, "This verse is not in the most reliable manuscripts", would you not get just a bit frustrated? What if you then went to Sunday School and studied Acts ch.8 and the girl next to you was called to read verses 30 to 38. She read, but the verse numbering in her N.I.V. went from 36 straight to 38, skipping 37. So the whole class had to stop in confusion. Afterwards you hear the pastor in the Sunday Sermon read from his KJV:

Revelation 5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;

But the pastor says, "Now these Beasts and Elders do not represent Christians, because in the original Greek it says 'men' instead of 'us'. (You then wonder why the pastor, of all people, didn't read from what he thought was real Bible to begin with.) In your confusion you then go home and decide to study what other godly teachers say about Revelation 5:9, and you find that these godly men also have degrees in Greek, but they say that the original Greek in Revelation 5:9 reads like the KJV! At this point you decide to drop the whole mess and simply "go with your feelings" about right and wrong.

Sound absurd? This is not how it happens? If you say that, then one guesses where you have been. You have been right there in front of the television set watching "Married With Children". If you had been witnessing you would know what excuses and frustrations people have met with.

One replies, that everyone does not respond with rebellion. Are there not many involved in street witnessing who are not KJV Onlyists? I am sure. Yet, we also hear what they believe and how most answer the common objections they encounter on the street:

"The Bible has been corrupted. You have no perfect copies. I have been to Christian school. I have my own higher power. The Bible is just a bunch of writings by men!"

Answer: "You have to have 'faith'. You are trying to reason it all out. That's why God says to have faith. Don't you know that you are special and God wants to fill that void inside of you? Can I pray for you?... 'God, bless Timmy, and let him know how much you love him. Fill him with your Spirit. Satan, I command you to flee, in Jesus' name!' Well, Timmy, how do you feel now?"

What was it that the Wiccan read in school that made him grin ear to ear? What is it that people are picking up on in Christian schools that cause them to be without fear? Why in the world is all of Christendom either opening their arms really, really wide to hug a fat Buddha statue, or else embracing the false security of a self-proclaimed, so-called "infallible" Catholic Church? One might find the answer in these words by Christians who are not liberal Sadducees, but profess themselves to be very conservative:

"Nothing less than the full inerrancy of the original manuscripts of Scripture can serve as the basis for the infallibility of the Holy Bible as the true Word of God...Throughout the history of the Christian church, it has been clearly understood that the Bible as originally given by God was free from error...Even the earliest and best manuscripts that we possess are not totally free of transmissional errors...It may be true that we no longer possess any perfect copy of the inerrant original manuscripts of the Bible. But it is equally true that we have only imperfect copies of the Lord Jesus available to us today...All the observer has to look at now are imperfect representatives and agents of His, in the form
of sanctified and committed Christians."
Gleason L. Archer, Encyclopedia Of Bible Difficulties, pp.11,19,27-29

That was not an Atheist publication. It was a book supposedly written to help saints defend the Bible from the attacks made by infidels! Notice another:

"All this sounds alarming. If no two manuscripts agree, how can we know what the Holy Spirit inspired the New Testament authors to write? The matter is, on the face of it, very difficult. All agree that one cannot simply take the oldest manuscripts and trust them, for they may conceivably be very poor copies,...Before taking the discussion further, I should pause and set at rest the troubled concern of anyone who, on the basis of what I have written so far, concludes that the manuscript tradition is entirely unreliable, or that we cannot really be certain of any of it. There is no need for such a rigorous pessimism... Moreover, many of the theologically significant variants can be sorted out quite easily by
comparing manuscript with manuscript."
D.A.Carson, The King James Version Debate, p.18,24

Let's face it. A "reliable" Bible with errors is not much of a threat. Nor is it very believable. One may mock at a true, perfectly translated Word from England, yet, remember,...the conservatives and liberals mocked at the Word Himself of Galilee. (Jn.7:47-52) Maybe you are missing something. "Come and see". (Jn.1:46)

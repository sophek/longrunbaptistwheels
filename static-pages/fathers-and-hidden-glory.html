TEXT: Psalms 4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

Luke 8:27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes...
35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind...

Revelation 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

1 Corinthians 11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.

Psalms 3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory...

Jeremiah 2:11 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.

Psalms 106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

Romans 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

Psalms 30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent...

9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people...

Psalms 108:1 O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

Man's tongue of praise is his own glory! And what has Satan done to man?: "O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?"

Psalms 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.

Acts 2:26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:

Psalms 149:5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;

Proverbs 28:12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory...

Proverbs 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.

Luke 17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
18 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.

Philippians 2:14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

Proverbs 20:29 The glory of young men is their strength...

Proverbs 17:6 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.

"...the glory of children are their fathers."

"...men become less relevant to both reproduction and parenting..."
(Prof. Greg Hampikian, The New York Times, Aug., 2012)

"...the father [was] the primary authority of the family for many centuries. His word was unquestioned, his decision final, his influence dominant in all matters relating to the family...Another factor in the diminished role of the father was psychology...psychology became part of the problem...The pendulum slowly began to swing back in the 1970s with newly designed studies beginning to support the impact of fathers..."
(Psychology Today, "The Importance of Fathers," June 23, 2011)

1 Thessalonians 2:11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,

Hebrews 12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence...
7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

Revelation 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.

        <h1>SURPRISE: ALCOHOL LEADS TO CANCER</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote>â€œReport reveals alcohol cancer linkâ€¦One in 10 cancers in men and one in 33 in women across Western Europe are caused by drinking, according to new research. While even small amounts increases the risk, drinking above recommended limits causes the majority of cancer cases linked to alcohol, experts saidâ€¦NHS guidelines are that men should drink no more than three to four units a day while women should not go over two to three units a day. But the new research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), found cancer risks at even lower levelsâ€¦Cancers of the pharynx, oesophagus and voice box were most commonly caused by alcohol, followed by liverâ€¦even more cancer cases would be prevented if people reduced their alcohol intake to below recommended guidelines or stopped drinking alcohol at allâ€¦Alcohol creates a chemical when it is broken down by the body which can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancerâ€¦â€

The â€œsurpriseâ€ is pure sarcasm. The Holy Bible teaches that â€œwineâ€ is a word that can mean fermented or unfermented beverages (â€œwineâ€ is said to be found â€œin the clusterâ€ of grapes in Isaiah 65:8). Â When wine is alcoholic, the Bible commands people to not even look at it!:
<blockquote><strong>Proverbs 23:31</strong> Look not thou upon the wineâ€¦32 At the last it biteth like a serpentâ€¦</blockquote>

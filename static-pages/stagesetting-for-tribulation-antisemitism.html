        <h1>STAGESETTING FOR TRIBULATION ANTISEMITISM</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli army has released a photograph of a toddler dressed as a suicide bomber that it says was discovered in a Palestinian militant's house in the West Bank city of Hebron....Ordinary Palestinians said if the photograph were genuine it was likely the child had been dressed up for fun and did not mean Palestinians were about to use children in suicide bombings - something they have never done. Children have been seen dressed up as suicide bombers at school ceremonies and rallies supporting militants spearheading a 21-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation." (June 28, 2002)

In the first book in our canon of the Old Testament, the Lord gives His promise and warning concerning the Jew:

Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

Genesis 27:29 ....cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

In response, Satan rages against the Jews for bringing forth the sacrificial Saviour, who will soon return to judge and rule the earth, and send Satan to Hell. He desires to exterminate the Jew to obliterate the prophecies. The nations, inspired by Satan, will likewise respond to God's promises and warnings by uniting against the Jews.

Psalms 83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of ISRAEL may be no more in remembrance.
5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

Psalms 74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

God will use these mad nations for His purposes; and then He will answer them swiftly:

Zechariah 1:14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
15 And I am VERY SORE displeased with the HEATHEN that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and THEY HELPED FORWARD THE AFFLICTION.

Joel 3:2 I will also gather ALL NATIONS, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage ISRAEL, whom they have scattered among the nations, and PARTED MY LAND.

Indeed, from the time that God promised to bless the world through Abraham's seed, Satan has sought to annihilate the offspring of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This devilish hatred will continue to increase until it reaches a climax in the Tribulation period. Catholics persecuted the Jews in the Inquisition. And who dares to forget the venomous hatred of the Nazis? Notice these murderous, malicious words from Hitler and his minions:

"This Jewish contamination will not subside, this poisoning of the nation will not end, until the carrier himself, the Jew, has been banished from our midst." (Hitler, Aug. 1920, D Irving, "The War Path: Hitler's Germany")

"As National Socialists we see our programme in our flag. In red, the social aspect of the movement; in white, the national; in the swastika emblem...the mission to fight for the victory of the Aryan man and likewise for the triumph of the idea of productive work; an IDEA ETERNALLY ANTISEMTIC. NO JEW SHALL BE A CITIZEN." (Hitler, "Times," June 10, 1932)

"The Jew has caused our misery, and to day he lives on our troubles. That is the reason why as Nationalists and as Socialists we are enemies of the Jew. He has ruined our race, rotted our morals, corrupted our traditions and broken our power. We are Jew-haters because we admit that we are Germans. The Jew is our greatest calamity." (Dr. Goebbels)

"The drive against the Jews is increasing in ferocity....The ordinary Jews have less chance of employment in Germany than has the habitual criminal in this country. About a third of the Jewish population is already faced with destitution. The persecution has given Hitler something like half a million jobs with which to reward his followers." ("Contemporary Review," Nov., 1933)

"There will be no peace for the nations, unless the Jews are expunged. From a moral point of view the Jews are, for the white race, what plague, consumption, and syphilis are to the health of humanity, and part of our bequest to our children must be the fight to annihilate Judea." (Herr Kobe, Nazi leader, "Manchester Guardian Weekly," May 25, 1934)

Hating the Jew Leads to Direct Hatred of God and His Word

To hate anyone for their race is to hate God's commandments. Hatred of the Jew, inevitably, matures into an OPEN hatred for God and the Bible:

"....a London editor ("Church of England Newspaper," Aug. 18, 1933) reports 'an almost unbelievable rumour we heard the other day from a well-informed source that a section of the Nazis is urging Herr Hitler to wage war on Christianity on the ground that Jesus was a Jew.' When all that emanates from Jewry becomes so fiercely obnoxious that the Old Testament is rejected because Jewish, a like fate awaits the New; and the refusal of the 'salvation that is of the Jews' (John iv. 22) is a refusal of the only salvation that saves."
(D.M. Panton, "The Dawn Magazine," Oct. 16, 1933)

"Jehovah is the desert demon of the Jews, and, once for all, the so-called Old Testament must be abolished as a book of religion; while our movement seeks to eliminate from the New Testament some of its obviously misplaced and superstitious gospel accounts. The Christian Churches are a prodigious conscious and unconscious falsification. Therefore one of the greatest tasks of the century is to give expression to the Nordic soul in the German National Church built up on national and individual honour." (Herr Rosenberg, Commissioner of the Fuhrer for the Supervision, Instruction, and Education of the Whole National Socialist Movement)

"The word 'heathen' is not regarded by us a term of reproach, but as an honored name. We are proud of our German belief and our Nordic heathenism. We believe that God has revealed himself to us in our German blood and German conscience...Our Holy Land is no longer Rome or Palestine, but Germany alone. We do not believe in the Holy Ghost, we believe in the holiness of blood ties. In the Evangelical Church Jews and semi-Jews are no longer allowed. Consequently, nowadays, neither Paul nor Christ himself would be allowed to be pastors....We will abolish Christian festivals and celebrate Yuletide, Eastertide, Whitsuntide, the summer solstice, harvestide, the gathering of the clans and the day of mourning for the dead." ("The A.B.C. of the German Heathen," published in Germany in 1935)

"Throw away from you the last remnants of your Christian education, which destroys the character of Nordic man. Hurl from you the Jewish-Christian ideas of sinfulness, pity, love for your enemies. Carry before you the conquering symbol of the swastika. We must be hard if we would conquer. A curse upon sympathy and mercy!....Youth! do you not feel the spirit of your fathers that aroused them to fight against that foreign doctrine - Christianity? Does not your heart burn to renew this struggle?...."("Nordland," Nazi magazine, Hitler Youth press)

The Jew: God's Dial

"The Jew first?....The world says No. God says Yes. The world has tried to cast down the Jew and cast him out, but in the plan and purpose of God he has been first and he will be first....there is the Jew first - as the Clue to God's Plans. The budding of the fig tree, the re-awakening of the Jewish nation, the return (in unbelief) of the Jew to his own land, this is to be THE sign that the end of this dispensation is near, and that the coming of the Lord is at hand....The Jewish nation, now in part blinded, shall yet be the head and not the tail (Deut. xxviii.13), the first which is now the last shall yet again be the first....Where are you putting him in your missionary thought, your prayer, your evangelistic effort? First? May the Lord Who has redeemed us with His blood, and sent us out to witness for Him, give us a greater love for the Jew and a greater desire that he may be reached with the message of the Gospel." (Dr. C.K. Mowll, "The Jew First;" in "Trust and Toiling," 1933)

"It is manifest that the granite Jew is being reserved for a gigantic destiny which slowly unfolds before our eyes: for the Jew is God's dial; and when he is in the Land, the Dawn will be in the sky. Dr. Herzl told a friend that it was the despair created in his soul by universal Anti-Semitism in which Zionism was born....Rabbi Levy, of Tresmont Temple, New York, says: - 'The Temple at Jerusalem will be rebuilt, or possibly the Mosque of Omar which now stands upon that site, will simply be cleansed and rededicated to Jehovah; for according to the strictest Jewish Law, any place of worship may be transformed into a Jewish synagogue or Temple by removing all idols, and rededicating it to the God of Israel.'" (D.M. Panton, "The Dawn Magazine," Aug. 15th, 1924)

The fact that Israel is in the promised land with the world growing weary is a sign that the time of Jacob's Trouble is drawing near. Let us resist the spirit of the world and the various cultic movements that deny the literal Millennial Kingdom, deny the literal Jews a place in future prophecy, and generate suspicion or hatred for the "brethren" (according to the flesh) of our sinless Saviour. We are not called to agree with everything that every Jew believes or does. We certainly must not consider Jews automatically saved. Christians must also avoid the snare of "Jewish" movements and traditions that undermine the King James Bible and spoil the saints (Col. 2). But we must equally resist the spirit of Satan that seeks to attack the system of literal, premillennial interpretation by stirring up prejudice and hatred for the modern Jews. We are not ignorant of his devices. Therefore, let all Christian Gentiles resist the Devil and fear God in these last days:

Romans 11:18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, BUT FEAR:
21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.

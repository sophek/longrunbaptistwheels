WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED TO BAPTIST FUNDAMENTALISM? ********************************************************************

In light of the recent accusations against the elderly Bob Gray in Florida (some apparently admitted by his church), we must hang down our heads in sorrow. He is accused of sexually abusing children. He has been seen as a pillar of modern fundamentalism. He joins a growing list of fallen heroes. It has actually become a sort of badge of honor among some younger Baptists to have moral problems like some of their aged heroes. What are the reasons for this sad state of affairs? What went wrong with Baptist fundamentalism in the last fifty years?

First of all, the men of my generation (40 years old) are indebted to the former generation. The former generation built large, Fundamental works for God at a time when the 1960's had promised to destroy the last traces of Biblical, traditional Christianity. While others mocked their work and scorned their fruit, they did not come down off the wall. They continued to build and evangelize. Their energy; their zeal, their love for souls, their evangelistic mind frame, their fire, has been largely lost today. And it would greatly benefit younger men in the ministry today to sit at the feet of these men who are still alive, and hear what they discern to be their mistakes, as well as their victories.

I would like to share my analysis of some of the weaknesses - not so we can puff ourselves up, but so we can do what we can to avoid repeating the same errors. Leaders must fix these problems with manly diligence and firmness, regardless of who it hurts or who raises a protest. Extreme times call for measures that appear extreme to the squeamish - and especially to those who are comfortable in Sodom. First, I will summarize some of these problems, with some brief comments, and then focus on an important, foundational root problem (i.e. no place for the fear of God in their doctrinal system).

1. The institution of the Family was not properly dealt with in a Biblical fashion by much of Baptist Fundamentalism in the latter half of the 20th century. "Dating" had replaced courting. Teens were not discouraged from having "boyfriends" and "girlfriends." Godly discretions such as never being alone with the opposite sex were too often seen as outdated and old-fashioned. Preachers often smirked and openly discussed unseemly or sexual topics before mixed audiences. Mothers were allowed or even encouraged to work outside the home (in direct disobedience to the Bible). In fact, some of the greatest churches of this time period were built by money that came from running Day Care Centers during the week (for the children of working mothers!). Women were indeed encouraged to submit; yet the Biblical prohibitions against women speaking in the church, and against their short hair, were ignored. Great preachers often boasted of the fact that they were so caught up in traveling the!

  world for Christ, and winning souls, that they did not have time to attend their son's basketball games, etc. This was seen as praiseworthy and sacrificial! Later years would soon reveal the devilish carnality that was left to develop in many of their children:

Proverbs 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.

2. The "high places" of Hollywood and TV were not removed! In the Bible, there were sometimes great revivals, when, even so, the idolatrous high places were left in place:

1 Kings 22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

2 Kings 15:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

4 Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

Although God rose up some preachers to sound the alarm against worldly television, etc. (1 Cor. 15:33), such men were largely ignored. "That's just Roloff. He is a good man, though he has some peculiar beliefs. He is extreme in some things." Meanwhile, the world had entered the living rooms and bedrooms of the majority of Christians, to spread its infections and diseases.

One cassette sermon I heard from this time period manifests the mind frame of many preachers. A preacher of a large, fundamental work reminds his church to come back for the evening service. He then says, "I know there is an important ball-game on the TV, but we will be bringing a TV into the fellowship hall so you can check it out before and after church." He was not laughing; nor did the audience laugh. This was "Fundamentalism 101" of that time period. Other such examples manifest that many were deceiving themselves, thinking that they could view filthy programs, yet not have their lives changed by them.

What did this produce in the saints? It produced a certain type of bitterness and coldness. It numbed the saints and desensitized them, while it enflamed them with the fires of worldly desire. It produced a profanity that lacked sobriety. Fasting and prayer were seen as "charismatic." Gluttony became a joke among the brethren, contrary to the Lord's warning against the spiritual dangers of surfeiting (Luke 21:34-36).

3. A confused, misguided teaching on the new man and the old man has also led to much sin. In many fundamentalist circles, it is taught that all sin is the old man sinning, and that the new man never sins. Instead of teaching that the believer is to put on the new man, and avoid walking in the old man, they end up teaching that all sin in the old man sinning (not the believer putting on the old man!). Therefore, when they mix this unbalanced, confused teaching with their loose teachings on the Judgment Seat, there is no end to the lawlessness that may result. Since they teach that only the new man will be judged at the Judgment Seat, and the new man never sins, there is therefore nothing the believer can be judged for doing! They teach that since the old man is incurably evil, he can do nothing but sin. They teach that "he" will be judged by Jesus, leaving the believer free from any punishment or accountability: "That's not me sinning, that is just my old nature!" "How can I!

  ever come into judgment at the Judgment Seat? I am a new man and the new man never sins!" I do not have time to develop this here, but the reader should understand that many of these people who commit fornication or adultery (or such like), actually think that it is not their own selves sinning, it is just their "flesh"! They do not see that they are making the choice to WALK after the flesh, and that for making that choice, they will have some condemnation by the Lord at the Judgment Seat! Horatius Bonar rebuked these errors concerning the new man/old man in the mid 1800's. Yet, somehow, it became entrenched within modern fundamentalism.

The Root Problem: Fundamentalism without the Fear of God:

In the 1800's, the premillennial hope in the Lord's return blossomed around the world. At the forefront of this movement were the doctrines that the pre-tribulational rapture and Millennial reign were rewards for holy watching (i.e. accountability). By the end of the 1800's, and throughout the first part of the 20th century, men like J. R. Graves, Robert Govett, G. H. Pember, etc., (all who embraced accountability) largely outshined men like Bullinger and Scofield. Even I. M. Haldeman (pastor of First Baptist of New York City in early 1900's) held to stripes, and even Millennial exclusion at the Judgment Seat for unfaithful believers.

But then Scofield placed his notes "in" the Bible. Many good men helped promote it (in spite of his errors) since it included a great defense of premillennialism against the postmillennial Modernists. Even by the time of early 1920's, when Robert E. Neighbour (1872-1945) founded the Baptist Bible Union with men like J. Frank Norris (see note 1 below), Baptist Fundamentalism was not yet defined by "Scofieldism." Neighbour did not believe that the warnings in the Gospels were ONLY Jewish. He applied the various warnings in Hebrews, etc., to true believers. Robert T. Ketcham (1889-1978) was also a leader among early Fundamental Baptists. He was a member with Neighbour in the Baptist Bible Union, and later led in the formation of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC), serving as vice president (1933) and president (1934-1938). Ketcham believed in literal chastisement at the Judgment Seat, and he rightly applied the Biblical warnings to true believers concer!

 ning the Millennium.

But somehow, somewhere, the precious pearl of Kingdom truth (with its warnings and hopes) was lost among most Fundamental Baptists. In the latter part of the 20th century, Scofieldism became the most prominent viewpoint among premillennialists. Therefore, these Fundamental Baptists were left with eternal security with NO ACCOUNTABILITY. They concentrated on soul winning and bus ministry and conferences. But they taught that every believer (even if he dies in blatant sin) will go directly to be with God and immediately experience the glories and pleasures of Heaven. He will later be resurrected at the coming of Christ to appear before an "award ceremony" where ONLY good prizes are given. So you see, Fundamental Baptists were taught that they could only lose some jewels or crowns, yet they were guaranteed all the glories of the New Jerusalem, in the intermediate state and during the Millennium (as well as forever). They could not miss the rapture. They could not miss entrance !

 into the Millennial Kingdom. They could not experience punishment at the Judgment Seat. Their eternal security was praiseworthy and sound. But the pretribulational rapture, the Judgment Seat, and the Millennium are in TIME, not the eternal state!

Of course, some tried to tighten up the situation by reminding believers that there was a sin unto death (in this life). But since the person dying would go immediately to paradise with every sumptuous delight imaginable (regardless of his degree of sin), and was also guaranteed entrance into the coming Millennium (and was even guaranteed a "well done thou good and faithful servant" from the Lord), the threat of an untimely death held little power over them. Furthermore, once a man has lived a certain number of years, some Christians, no doubt, figured that they had tasted enough on this side, and what would it really matter if they died, since they were guaranteed an immediate paradise with no fear or shame or real punishment at the Judgment Seat or during the Millennium?

Others tried to "tighten things up" by hardening the Gospel. Unless a certain standard of holiness was maintained (of course, gluttony and Hollywood were given a free pass), there could be no assurance of salvation. But by front-loading and back-loading the Gospel, such churches were soon filled with unbelievers going about to establish their own righteousness, instead of submitting to the free gift of positional righteousness offered by God. The strength of sin is the law (1 Cor. 15:56, Rom. 7:11). Such Pharisees (under the law of works) are often able to hide their immoralities from men, yet they become Satanically bitter and hostile in their self-righteousness:

Galatians 4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

I am no fan of a "quick-prayerism" that does not fully explain the Gospel (e.g. "invite Jesus into your heart-ism," etc.). But abandoning or perverting the Gospel of grace so it will not be abused by sinners is like throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

I am also aware that the sin of judgmental, hostile self-righteousness can exist in true believers (especially where there are other moral failings). Big, old Eli was very harsh to Hannah, and quick to judge her (1 Samuel 1:14). Yet, notice, in contrast, how nice he was to his own, immoral sons, when they actually deserved the death penalty (1 Samuel 2:24-25). He gave them only a light reproof, and God later judged him for it (1 Samuel 3:13):

Matthew 7:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 

Knowledge and correct standards can puff us up and cause us to be harsh, and mean-spirited, especially when the brethren are praising us and cheering us onward. (Of course, the loose, "Let me do whatever I want," Sadducees can be just as nasty spirited as the Pharisees!)

But let's put aside the debate over exactly what fills church buildings with more unbelievers (whether quick-prayerism or hard-believism). The fact remains that Baptist Fundamentalism is also filled with many TRUE believers who, nevertheless, have no fear of God. They profess to fear Him, yet they have no real place for it in their doctrine, other than the "sin unto death." This faulty teaching on the Judgment Seat of Christ (when mixed with snuggling up close to Hollywood, etc.) has no doubt produced a toxic soup that breeds fornicators, adulterers, and even molesters!

The Bible hinges almost everything a Christian does or does not do on the Judgment Seat of Christ. Should Christians assemble together? The "day approaching" is the motivation (Hebrews 10:25). Should Christian refrain from grudges towards one another? The Lord is coming soon and is at the door (James 5:8-10). The coming day of the Lord's appearing, and His judgment of His saints, is the constant emphasis of the New Testament. But this teaching was not only watered-down, the whole emphasis was lost by much of Baptist Fundamentalism in the latter part of the 20th century. How often did one hear a sermon on the Judgment Seat? Should it not, in some way or another, be the expressed motivation of almost every sermon to the saints?

But what happens when the evangelization of unbelievers becomes the SOLE purpose of every Sunday morning sermon (when most of the church is gathered)? Will not believers become doctrinally anemic? Will they not largely become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal? The Great White Throne will eclipse the importance of the Judgment Seat of Christ in the lives of believers. They will apply sermons to others, since they are already saved. What do they have to worry about? They might go to the altar a few times to make sure their salvation is really "sticking." But in reality, they will live without the fear of God.

Soul winning (i.e. having feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace - Eph. 6:15) is, indeed, a crucial part of our spiritual armor. It keeps us "red hot" in many ways, and mindful of eternal realities. However, it is only ONE part of our armor. The Sword of the Spirit is filled with warnings and hopes in relation to the Judgment Seat of Christ. And he who does not understand these is not truly lifting his Sword, or even the shield of faith. Faith sees that which is not yet seen by the naked eye. And the Judgment Seat of Christ, and the corresponding Kingdom of God, are crucial, unseen, future realities that must be daily beheld with the eyes of faith. Furthermore, the shoes (i.e. the gospel of peace, or soul winning), relate to more than just the revelation about how the soul may live eternally; this gospel also includes the news about how the soul may live with Christ in His coming Millennial Kingdom, as a "child of the Kingdom." Therefore, much of Baptist Funda!

 mentalism in the latter half of the 20th century has had FAULTY OR INCOMPLETE ARMOR.

The Kingdom of God is usually the Millennial Kingdom in the New Testament:

1 Corinthians 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up THE KINGDOM to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

25 For he must reign, TILL he hath put all enemies under his feet.
26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

The Bible teaches that "the kingdom" in the New Testament is usually the temporary, "Millennial" Kingdom. This is the Kingdom that is focus of the warnings and hopes set before believers in the Bible. The "Gospel" teaches that one must be born again, and thereby assured of everlasting life when the New Jerusalem descends upon the New Earth (for good) after the Millennium. Without this new birth one cannot even enter or see the Millennial Kingdom. But there are other requirements and qualifications for entrance. One must avoid the "exclusion" sins of 1 Corinthians 6, Galatians 5 and Ephesians 5. And we must hear the words of our Lord on the subject of the Kingdom (e.g. see all of Matthew 18).

In contrast to these warnings, the Fundamentalism of the latter half of the 20th century largely ignored the Gospels, as far as believers are concerned. It taught that the "Kingdom" therein was synonymous with "Heaven" (and this "Heaven" itself was wrongly held to be synonymous with everlasting life - even though God comes down "from Heaven" in Revelation 21, with the city, and He dwells "with men" forever).

In closing, great failings call for a re-examination of our armor. Is it complete? Has the Devil given us an imitation? Did we miss some "high places" when we put on the breastplate of righteousness? Failings also call for more fear, more prayer, more carefulness and more caution:

2 Peter 3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.

When will we turn aside from the false prophets of our time, and hear the rod of God?

Micah 6:9 The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city...hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

Why are so many so dull of hearing in regard to the plain warnings? Is it not that they are drunk with the traditions of the elders? Do they not expect that any "true" move of God's Spirit must approve of them, and never go beyond what they have plainly taught? Do they not say, "If this teaching concerning the fear of God was true, then why have the majority of fundamental men today missed it?"  John 7:48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed...?

MORE HOLLYWOOD CONFUSION: "PG" NOW CAN MEAN "WARNING: PRO-GOD"!
***********************************************************************
For years, many believers have let the world define what is morally dangerous for their children or themselves. But the world is not able to define what is moral or immoral, any more than it can tell you what institution of learning is worthy or unworthy. Its standards have no basis. The word will label nudity "PG," and many Christians jump for joy, and view such movies, not realizing that if the world thinks something is dangerous for children, it is probably actually dangerous for adults! (Now believers often view "R" movies with no shame). But the MPAA's ratings cannot be trusted. They will label something "PG" that should be labeled "R." Or they might label something "R," that a few years ago would have been labeled "X"! To add to this insanity, they are now placing Christianity in the same light as nudity, violence and profanity! Notice the following news report. The MPAA has now used "PG" to warn against Christianity!:

WASHINGTON (BP) - The Motion Picture Association of America is crystal clear when it describes why its 'PG' rating exists - it's a warning flag. 'The theme of a PG-rated film may itself call for parental guidance,' the online explanation of the rating system states....The Christian moviemakers behind a low-budget film called 'Facing the Giants' were stunned when the MPAA pinned a PG rating on their gentle movie about a burned-out, depressed football coach whose life - on and off the field - takes a miraculous turn for the better. 'What the MPAA said is that the movie contained strong 'thematic elements' that might disturb some parents,' said Kris Fuhr, vice president for marketing at Provident Films, which is owned by Sony Pictures. Provident plans to open the film next fall in 380 theaters nationwide with the help of Samuel Goldwyn Films, which has worked with indie movies like 'The Squid and the Whale.' Which 'thematic elements' earned this squeaky-clean movie its PG? 'Fac!

 ing the Giants' is too evangelistic..."

The solution?:

Psalms 101:3 I will set NO wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

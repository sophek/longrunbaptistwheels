            <blockquote>AUSTIN â€” A House committee heard pleas Tuesday to ban corporal punishment in Texas schools, with critics denouncing the disciplinary tool as a legalized form of child abuse that leaves lasting emotional scars.

Rep. Alma Allen, D-Houston, who spent nearly four decades in the Houston system school system, is pushing legislation that would ban paddling in schools. One of Allenâ€™s leading allies is Rep. Barbara Nash, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Arlington and a former member of the Arlington school board.

â€œThereâ€™s enough violence in the world without it coming into your schools,â€ Nash said.

Nash and Allen sit next to each other in the House and teamed up after discovering they share the goal of outlawing corporal punishment.

Nash is a joint author of the proposed ban.

A two-part series in the Star-Telegram this month examined corporal punishment in Texas, one of 20 states that allow school officials to paddle students. More than a dozen opponents of the practice gathered at a rally before the hearing, circulating graphic pictures of paddling injuriesâ€¦â€ http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/03/15/2924494/paddling-in-schools-is-subject.html</blockquote>
These feminist, Dr. Spock lawmakers need to find something better to do with their time. Their ways have already been tried for 50 years and they have brought nothing but rotten fruit. Even in the late 60â€²s, an article in the New York Times called for people to ignore Dr. Spock and begin healthy spanking. And now, after another 4o years of watching the rotten fruit of psychobabble manifest itselfâ€¦these women want to ban schools from using paddles. I am sure the drug companies are all too happy about such bills. DRUGS ARE THE NEW WAY OF KEEPING THE PEACE!

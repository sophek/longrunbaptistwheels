        <h1>RESPONSE TO JAMES W. KNOX'S "WILL SOME CHRISTIANS MISS THE KINGDOM?"</h1>
        <div id="content">
            James W. Knox of Deland, Florida seems like a nice enough fellow. He has placed in print an 81 page booklet called, "Will Some Christians Miss the Kingdom?" Knox embraces many true doctrines; however, he has erred in falling for a radical hyper-dispensational antinomianism that is entirely new to fundamental Baptist theology. He even views John 15 as applying to Israel! It is important to understand that Knox is responding to an article written by brother Bill Jackson called "If," which is only meant to be an overview and primer for understanding accountability teaching. I recently (July 15, 2002) mailed Knox a copy of my 440 page book. But his booklet was written months before he ever read one page of my book. In fact, every objection Knox raises is already answered in my book. Knox simply goes further than most hyper-dispensationalists have dared to go in ducking accountability. To Knox, the warnings to believers simply tell professors to become Christians. And any other warning supposedly applies to Israel, even though it is directed to believing disciples, and Christ commissioned His disciples to teach His words to all the nations (Matthew 28). In conclusion, if anyone thinks he may read Knox's booklet and find answers to the arguments of a 440 page book that Knox has never read, filled with 6 years of research, with quotes and arguments from rare books around the world, he is greatly and presumptuously deceived. His booklet is NOT an answer to my book, or even to brother Jackson's article. Knox chose to sidetrack the issue by debating the various views of the KJV's perfection. For the record, Bill Jackson does not believe in CORRECTING the KJV by the Greek, but in getting more insight from Greek definitions (which I have seen many Ruckmanites even do). However, this is not a practice I engage in. I have a large collection of English dictionaries (new and old), and feel that I am able to find the fullness of meaning in English. But the whole debate is beside the point! Brother Jackson's arguments and points stand regardless of the Greek debate. You cannot dismiss them by simply pointing out that brother Bill quoted the Greek. Our dear brother Knox appears to have jumped the gun by attempting to shoot down a subject that is far more complex than he realizes. Ironically, I will help publicize his booklet as an EXAMPLE of what Christians are left with if they try to refute the accountability truths. However, I do warn readers that Knox's booklet is NOT an answer to my book. He has not even read any of my book yet! When he does so - any of it - we welcome and encourage the debate.

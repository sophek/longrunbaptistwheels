EVANGELIST PAUL RADER ON THE COMING JUDGMENT OF CHRISTIANS:
 
Evangelist Paul Rader (1879-1938) was named by J. Vernon McGee as the "greatest preacher this country ever produced...Thousands of people came to Christ through his ministry." Indeed, Rader was often referred to in newspapers as the, "Billy Sunday-style evangelist." He was a former prize fighter who became known as a pioneer in Christian radio (1922). He was the pastor of Moody Church (1915-1921), as well as a church in Fort Wayne, Indiana (1935-36). He was a popular prophecy conference speaker.
 
In 1928, Rader authored a booklet titled, "A Thousand Years of Justice." As with other popular Fundamentalists of his day (Haldeman, Oswald J. Smith, R. E. Neighbour, D. M. Panton, R. T. Ketcham, Nee, etc.), Rader is bold and unapologetic about the punishments believers may experience at the Judgment Seat of Christ (while contending for eternal security). We must remember that these men are writing at a time when liberalism, humanism and psychology had not yet fully saturated most of the churches and ministries. There would come a time, later, when Tozer would write: 
 
"The Bible truth that has been obscured and buried and forgotten as a result, is the doctrine of probation. We seldom hear anything about it any more and a man who wants to consider it and talk about it and turn back to the Bible teaching is made to feel very much like a heretic...In this case, it has gone so far that leading teachers now take the position that the doctrine of probation and spiritual preparation is not Biblical...we are so eager to get out from under all responsibility we kick up our irresponsible heels like an unbroken colt and snort our defiance of all judgment."
But in Rader's day (1928), the "leading teachers" still stressed accountability at the Lord's appearing. Yet, things changed very rapidly in the age of Hollywood. In a few decades, an entire doctrine (the Judgment Seat of Christ for Christians) would be completely altered, along with the true histories of fundamentalism and premillennialism. May this excerpt from Paul Rader stir you to revival and boldness in proclaiming the Lord warnings to His people:
 
 
A THOUSAND YEARS OF JUSTICE, By PAUL RADER:
 
 "The thousand years of Christ's reign on earth with its judgments and justice make the great high peak presented in the Scriptures. It is the subject of the greater part of prophecy. Since it is a time of justice and judgment, and since it is presided over by One who has been thoroughly tempted and tried, One who has suffered and died, to prove His merit - therefore all who take part in this thousand years must also be of proven merit, many of them even proven by martyrdom. Any position held in this regime and reign is upon individual merit, and individual merit alone. No position in this Kingdom is held because of grace alone. Everyone in this reign with Christ, of course, is a born-again, saved, Christian; but, more than that, everyone, beside being a saved individual, is an overcomer, a Christian, Spirit-filled, and one who has walked in spiritual victory, a worthy.
 
Everything that has to do with this thousand years must meet the most terrific fires of testing. Only that which can pass through the fire test at the Judgment Seat of Christ can be admitted into this thousand years of millennial splendor. This millennial splendor of a thousand years is not salvation, is not eternal life, is not heaven. It is a manifestation of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, and an earthly manifestation of the kingdom of the heavenlies. There are Scriptures that would almost lead one to believe that a regenerate believer can be lost, because of the terrific tests upon character and conduct at the Judgment Seat of Christ, which prove a believer worthy of a place in this kingdom reign and blessing. The excluding of believers as unfit to take part in this kingdom and in this thousand year reign cannot be the casting out of believers from eternal life which is given on the ground of grace and faith alone in the merits and work of Jesus Christ.
 
...the believer does not enter this kingdom simply because he is a believer, but because as a believer he has walked in the will of God, and is worthy of a place in this kingdom. The kingdom is the place of rewards for worthy Christians, and the most fiery tests are to be given during his present life and at the Judgment Seat of Christ to determine who are worthy to enter the kingdom, and just what position they shall occupy because of their worth; and just what crown they shall wear, because of their individual merit as faithful Christians. The test at the Judgment Seat is not a test of whether one is lost or damned; for only the truly born again and saved appear there, and the "accounted worthy" will be resurrected at the 'first resurrection' and given a place in this coming, glorious kingdom, (Luke 20:35,36; Rev. 20: 5, 6).
 
With these truths of the millennial judgments and the reign of justice, we can now bring into bold relief the teaching of the Scripture concerning salvation by grace alone apart from works. The outstanding Scripture is Ephesians, the second chapter, the eighth and ninth verses: For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no-one can boast. Even a sinner's works not only come very far from saving him, but these works actually have to be repented of. When we truly see salvation through the merits of Jesus Christ alone, works (before salvation) appear before God as filthy rags from which we are to turn away as from things that have no value. Can we take a dead tree and prune the branches, expecting that it will bring forth fruit?...It is only the living believer, made alive in Christ, who can be chastened and pruned, in order that he may bear fruit. We are made a new creation in Christ, when we by faith accept Him as our new life. It is by faith alone that the life of the Lord Jesus Christ is given to us. This life is the gift of God, and is called 'eternal life.'
 
God has provided a method of bringing believers from their habits and natural ways and from their sins of omission and commission by a wonderful system of chastening: and the reason for this chastening is stated in Hebrews 12:10 thus: He chastens us 'for our good, that we may share in His holiness.' The chastening, then, of God is not to get us saved by making us walk right, but by making us walk right through chastening because we are saved, to make us 'share in His holiness'...The Judgment Seat of Christ, with its punishments, is to fully bring about final perfection in those who have received this gift of eternal life. God has promised to perfect those to whom He has given God's life. They cannot be lost. Therefore they must be judged and perfected. If they are found at the Judgment Seat of Christ - because of their walk as a Christian - unworthy of a place in the thousand-year reign of Christ and are held for judgment, it is only that they show up perfected after the thousand years are finished. 
 
We see that the incestuous believer (1Cor. 5) was excommunicated, but not damned, even before the dawning of the Judgment Seat of Christ. Believers were to hand this man over to Satan that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord. This man, so terribly handed over, turns back again in obedience to Jesus Christ: for again in 2 Cor. 2: 7, 8, we find Paul telling them to forgive and comfort him and to reaffirm their love for him. This shows us that all severe chastening is that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord, even though he may not share in the future reign of the Lord Jesus Christ, because of his checkered walking - for we have this passage: 'If we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him.' The opposite, of course, becomes true: if we will not forsake sin and suffer with Him, we cannot reign with Him.
 
Some of the withered branches (that is, branches that had formerly life-giving power by the indwelling Holy Spirit) in the Vine are cast away early by judgments that Christ lets happen in this life - even before they get to the Judgment Seat of Christ. Their very withering is Christ's judgment and chastening, that He might burn up their self-sufficiency, their thought that they can abide in themselves. He has said plainly :- Apart from Me you can do nothing (John 15:5). What gathering men have made of these disgraced and backslidden, 'branches'! What a burning there will be of all their branch growth and work - outside the will of God, by deliberate sin and defiant disobedience to the principles and commands of Christ, - at His Judgment Seat! It will all be shown for what it is - wood, hay or straw, (1Cor.3:12). Paul speaks of those who are weak and sick (1Cor. 11:30) because of some cherished, selfish, sin. God speaks of those who have been killed early - and this death sentence is from Christ, though they are believers. It is not eternal death, but a premature natural death, (Acts 5:1-11). Surely these, after this awful burning at the Judgment Seat, who were given no opportunity to repent, will be the variety spoken of previously, who are saved but only as one escaping through the flames (1Cor.3:15); they will certainly not be 'accounted worthy' to rise at 'the first resurrection' to rule over two, five or ten cities, during the thousand year rule of Christ.
 
All sin finds terrific judgment with God, and though the worldly servant (Luke 12:46) is not to loose his eternal life, his judgment for walking like an unbeliever and like a sinner is to taste a portion of the sinner's judgment. Such verses as have been quoted here can be held up against the great mountain peaks of salvation eternally secured by faith and faith alone. Such verses do not shake in the least the principle of eternal security and salvation by grace built upon a foundation which is Christ and His righteousness and His merit; but it does let the Christian know that his walk is to be circumspect, that he is to seek holiness, that he is to seek all the fullness of the Spirit, and have an excess of oil in his vessel with his lamp, and to watch for and walk with Jesus, if he is to escape judgment, and if he is to receive for overcoming a great reward.
 
Let me say in closing that at the judgment seat punishment is passed out to the guilty. If punishment is not to be passed out, a judgment throne would be a joke. Remember, the great crisis hour is called by God, 'The Judgment Seat of Christ.' It is not just a reward seat of Christ. To hear some Christians who believe in eternal security and in sure salvation by faith alone talk, you would think that they can walk to suit themselves and then come up to this great hour, as if all they had to do was to walk up and receive a 'well done' from God. We are coming to a throne of judgment. We are coming to have the white light of God fall upon every act of our lives, and even the motives which were responsible for them, since we have become Christians. The appearance of all these servants and these stewards and these backsliders and these Christians who have not walked properly at the Judgment Seat of Christ, and not at the judgment of sinners a thousand years from that time, proves their conversion, and that they were born again people who must be judged as Christians and not as lost sinners.
 
We must look into the face of Him who has suffered for us, who has died for us, who lives for us, who can do all things for us, and be judged for what we have allowed Him to do in us, through us, and for us. Almost unthinkable judgments are to be passed upon Christians. Think of the words, 'torment,' 'outer darkness,' 'weeping and gnashing of teeth,' (Matt.8:12), until you have paid the utmost farthing, (Matt.5:26). O dear Christian friend, how dare you live a careless moment in sin, in unforgiveness, in self will? We are those who have received much, oh! so much, and from us much is expected.
 
Such promises as the following should cause any real Christian to forsake anything in order to be one who gets all that is here promised. Jesus Christ says in Rev.2, and at the end of the chapter: 'he that overcometh, and keepeth my works' (look in Acts for his works) unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter they shall be broken to shivers (Rev.2: 26,27). And here again. Could anything be above this? Oh soul of mine, reach forward for this: 'Lay aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily beset us' (Heb.12:1). Let us gain this: - 'To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne' (Rev. 3:21).
 
Ours is a fight for fellowship, so that Christ can do in us, and for us and through us all that He has planned. One of the saints of God has said: 'If I can be thus crowned, can I be otherwise than a fool, if I am not prepared to sacrifice all to win it?' Hear Christ say: To him that overcometh will I give a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it (Rev. 2:17). Oh, to have a secret like this with Christ! What an entry it must be into life's deepest joys!"

KILLER USES NO-ACCOUNTABILITY TEACHING AS AN EXCUSE
 
"'Once saved, always saved' - Deacon says killer rests in heaven - Sodini wrote in his online diary that the pastor...convinced him it was possible to commit mass murder and still be welcomed into heaven."
(www.pittsburghlive.com, Aug. 8, 2009)
 
This murderer joins the growing list of self-murderers who committed suicide when told they would go immediately to the bliss of Heaven, if they killed themselves, with no future judgment (e.g. John Macarthur's church was once sued for his teaching that, "even if a believer takes his own life, the Lord will still receive him into His presence"). Certainly, many modern Christians go to the other extreme and say that no one could ever be truly regenerate and commit murder of any kind. Many have not considered that their abusive eating habits, etc., are a form of slow self-murder. 
 
I certainly do not maintain that every wicked sinner who calls himself a Christian is truly regenerate. On the other hand, the Bible is not shy about warning us that believers can fall greatly, and refuse to repent. Believers do not always submit to God's chastisement - they may faint or despise it:
 
2 Corinthians 12:20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: 
21 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.  
 
The Bible gives the unfruitfulness of saints as a sad possibility:
 
1 Corinthians 3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. 
14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 
15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 
16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 
 
Mark 4:17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. 
18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 
19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
 
Titus 3:14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
 
2 Peter 1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 
7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 
8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
 
1 Peter 4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. 
17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? 
18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? 
 
God has made every provision necessary for saints to bear fruit. Yet, they are commanded to abide and walk in the Spirit, so they may bear fruit. As saints of light, they are commanded to walk as saints of light, and not walk as men (Ephesians 5:8, 1 Corinthians 3:3). 
 
One way the Lord perfects fruit in His people is through the preaching of pastors (Ephesians 4:12). But what happens when pastors no longer preach the Word of God?: 
 
Psalms 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
 
When the warnings of the Word are not preached, people will not be stirred to fear the Lord. Therefore, few will "move" like Noah, and depart from evil:
 
Proverbs 16:6...by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.
 
This is one reason that the Bible teaches that pastors (and anyone who teaches others) are in danger of receiving a greater condemnation (James 3:1, Matthew 5:19-20).
 
Therefore, the plain, unadulterated truth needs to be constantly preached. By all means, let us preach the truth of salvation by grace through faith alone in the blood of Jesus (along with eternal security). Let us preach these truths without compromise. Let us not pervert this truth to guard it from abuse. Instead, let us obey God and ALONGSIDE these truths, let us proclaim the warnings to believers about this life and the Judgment Seat of Christ. It is God's way. It is the Bible way. If people don't like it, they can write their own "bible." But for those wise souls who desire to follow the Holy Bible, inspired and preserved by God, let them hear these dual truths.
 
 
DOES GOD LOVE WICKED SINNERS?
 
Recently, Pastor Anderson of Arizona is back in the news. A brother of one of our church members attends the church he pastors. This pastor made the news by saying that he prays for the death of Obama. The pastor did give a good statement to the media about their hypocrisy concerning abortion - considering his words so horrible, yet viewing the whole subject of abortion as sane and proper. In Anderson's sermon, he discussed the fact that God hates some people. Pastor Anderson misses the fact that, first, "hate" sometimes means to "love less" than something or someone else (Genesis 29:30-31, and compare Matthew 10:37 with Luke 14:26). Secondly, there is more than one type of love. God can love all people benevolently, yet love only some people complacently. This distinction was commonly understood at one time. The following is from an older article I penned, that may be useful for some today:
 
Malachi 2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and HE DELIGHTETH IN THEM; or, Where is the God of judgment?
 
When God-fearing Christians begin to take a public stand for God's truth and commandments, inevitably, some people respond: "But God loves everyone; you are filled with hate!" Such emotional responses are often rooted in GREAT CONFUSION concerning the nature of God and His Scriptures. They are a product of our post-Christian culture, which has been so negatively influenced by humanism and immoral entertainment that many have become grossly ignorant of the Bible, Christian history, and sadly, the ENGLISH DICTIONARY.
 
Does God love homosexuals? Should obedient Christians love homosexuals? The answer is plain enough in the Bible: God hates sodomy, AND GOD HATES HOMOSEXUALS! But God also LOVES homosexuals; and it is His desire that they be not only saved, but also delivered from the power of their horrible sin. 
 
The above statements will not appear contradictory when one realizes that there are multiple meanings for the Biblical word "love." Therefore, to ascertain whether or not God LOVES homosexuals, we might start by looking up the word "love" in an ENGLISH DICTIONARY! The Oxford English Dictionary, in defining "love," states:
 
"Theologians distinguish the LOVE OF COMPLACENCY, which implies approval of qualities in the object, and the LOVE OF BENEVOLENCE, which is bestowed irrespective of the character of the object."
 
The Oxford Dictionary then quotes Sir Edward Leigh in 1650:
 
"There is a two fold love in God...1. Amor Benevolentiae, a love of well willing...2. Amor Complacentiae, a love of complacency." ("Annot. New Testament")
 
Noah Webster, in 1828, defined "complacency" as: "Pleasure; satisfaction....The cause of pleasure or joy." (Webster, "An American Dictionary of the English Language," 1828)
 
Therefore, according to these definitions, God does NOT love any practicing, unrepentant sinner with the LOVE OF COMPLACENCY. In other words, God gets no pleasure, satisfaction, or delight in sodomites, adulterers, thieves, pedophiles, etc. God does, however, love ALL sinners with the LOVE OF BENEVOLENCE:
 
Matthew 5:45...he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 
 
God has demonstrated His loved to all persons in the world by sending His Son to atone for their sins so they might be saved:
 
John 3:16 For God SO LOVED THE WORLD, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
 
Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his LOVE toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
 
Sadly, some sinners reject this free gift. They will not believe the Gospel. And God's benevolent love for all mankind will not stop Him from one day throwing the unbelieving sinner into a Lake of Fire for all eternity (Revelation 20:15). This present age is the time of God's mercy and patience. It is the day of warning. But sinners die. And one day, this age of grace will end, and the day of vengeance will begin! God does not want this to happen (in His benevolent love). His benevolent love for sinners is seen in the fact that it is not His will that any should perish:
 
2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
 
But this benevolent love of God for sinners has been interpreted in this modern age in such a manner as to teach that God does not see sin! The truth is that God not only sees sin, He abhors it! And He abhors whoever commits it! This has to do with His love of complacency. Therefore, in one sense, GOD HATES HOMOSEXUALS. Notice how the Bible makes this clear:
 
Psalms 11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the WICKED and him that loveth violence his soul HATETH.
 
God hates "wicked" people. And sodomy (i.e. homosexuality) is a WICKED sin:
 
Genesis 13:13 But the men of SODOM were WICKED and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. [see Genesis 19:5]
 
Psalms 5:5 ...thou HATEST ALL WORKERS OF INIQUITY. 
6 ...the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
 
Psalms 5:5 teaches that God hates all workers of "iniquity." Sodomy (homosexuality) is great INIQUITY:
 
Genesis 19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the INIQUITY of the city [i.e. Sodom].
 
Proverbs 11:20 THEY that are of a froward heart ARE ABOMINATION to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.
 
The above verses make it clear that, although God desires homosexuals to be saved and delivered from their sins, He in no way DELIGHTS in their sins OR their persons! In regard to His complacent love, HE ABHORS THEM. Other verses teach this same truth (Psalms 10:33, Proverbs 12:22, James 4:4, 1 John 2:15, etc.) There are also many verses that say the same thing in a different manner. Notice:
 
John 14:21 He that hath my commandments, and KEEPETH THEM, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me SHALL BE LOVED OF MY FATHER, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
 
John 14:21 teaches that people (even Christians) who do not keep the Lord's commandments are not loved by God in THIS manner. God does not delight in them (Hebrews 10:38, Ecclesiastes 5:4). Instead, He is GRIEVED (Ephesians 4:30).
 
In regard to this subject of GOD'S LOVE, many in this perverse age would do well to take some time to study the words of Christian theologians from former days. They would understand that the Bible teaches us to love homosexuals - but not in such a manner that they are made to feel comfortable in their sin!:
 
Richard Turnbull (in the 17th century) shows that it is SIN to delight in sinners and refuse to reprove their sins:
 
"To wink at their wickedness, to uphold them in their iniquity, to fawn upon them and flatter them, to praise them when they deserve just reproof, is, as it were, an honouring of them; to which, as to a most grievous sin, the prophet denounces a most bitter curse: 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!' Isaiah 5:20."
(Quoted in Spurgeon's, "Treasury of David")
 
Thomas Manton (1620-1677) writes:
 
"It is a smart question that of the prophet, 2 Chron. xix. 2, 'Shouldest thou hate the godly, and love those that hate the Lord?' Surely a gracious heart cannot take them into his bosom: he loveth all with a love of good will, as seeking their good, but not with a love of complacency, as delighting in them....it is complacency we are speaking of and so 'the wicked is an abomination to the righteous,' Prov. xxix. 27. The hatred of displacency is opposite to the love of complacency, as the hatred of enmity to the love of benevolence. We cannot enter into a confederacy and intimate kindness with them." 
("Christ's Transfiguration")
 
Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) writes:
 
"Psalm 139:21, 22. 'Do I not hate them, O Lord, that hate thee! And am I not grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred.' Not that he hated them with a hatred of malice or ill will, but with displacency and abhorrence of their wickedness. In this respect we ought to be the children of our Father who is in heaven, who, THOUGH HE LOVES MANY WICKED MEN WITH A LOVE OF BENEVOLENCE, YET CANNOT LOVE THEM WITH A LOVE OF COMPLACENCY." 
("The Nature and End of Excommunication")
 
Charles G. Finney (1792-1895) has written extensively on this subject:
 
"God loves all men with the love of benevolence, but He does not feel the love of complacency toward any but those who love holy." 
("Revival Lectures," Lecture II)
 
"Let us next consider attentively the nature of this love. The text [John 3:16] lays special stress on this - God SO loved - His love was of such a nature, so wonderful and so peculiar in its character, that it led Him to give up His only Son to die....Unless we understand this, we shall be in danger of falling into the strange mistake of the Universalists, who are forever talking about God's love for sinners, BUT WHOSE NOTIONS OF THE NATURE OF THIS LOVE NEVER LEAD TO REPENTANCE OR TO HOLINESS. They seem to think of this love as simply good nature, and conceive of God only as a very good-natured being, whom nobody need to fear....1. This love in its nature is NOT COMPLACENCY - a delight in the character of the race. This could not be, for there was nothing amiable in their character. For God to have loved such a race complacently would have been infinitely disgraceful to Himself. 2. It was not a mere emotion or feeling. It was not a blind impulse, though many seem to suppose it was...He had emotion, but not emotion only."
("God's Love for a Sinning World")
 
"God is not angry merely against the sin abstracted from the sinner, BUT AGAINST THE SINNER HIMSELF. Some persons have labored hard to set up this ridiculous and absurd abstraction, and would fain make it appear that God is angry at the sin yet not at the sinner. He hates the theft, but loves the thief. He abhors adultery, but is pleased with the adulterer. Now this is supreme non-sense. The sin has not moral character apart from the sinner. The act is nothing apart from the actor. The very thing that God hates and disapproves is not the mere event - the thing done in distinction from the doer; but it is the doer himself....The sinner himself is the direct and the only object of His anger. So the Bible shows. God is angry with the wicked - not with the abstract sin....We sometimes hear men say, 'God is too good to be angry at sinners.' What do men mean by this language? Do they mean that God is too good to be opposed to all evil - too good to be displeased with all evil-doers? This were indeed a strange goodness! God too good to hate sin - too good to oppose sinners! What sort of goodness can this be?....God's anger against the sinner does not exclude love - real, compassionate love. NOT HOWEVER THE LOVE OF COMPLACENCY, but THE LOVE OF WELL-WISHING AND GOOD-WILLING; not the love of him as a sinner, but the love for him as a sentient being who might be infinitely happy in obedience to his God." 
("God's Anger Against the Wicked," 1849) 
 
"You are to bear witness to the reality of the LOVE of Christ, by the REGARD YOU SHOW FOR HIS PRECEPTS, HIS HONOR....You should act as if you believed that He died for the sins of the whole world, and as if you blamed sinners for rejecting His great salvation. THIS IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN IMPRESS SINNERS WITH THE LOVE OF CHRIST. Christians, instead of this, often live so as to make the impression on sinners that Christ IS SO COMPASSIONATE THAT THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE TO FEAR FROM HIM. I have been amazed to see how a certain class of professors want ministers TO BE ALWAYS PREACHING ABOUT THE LOVE OF CHRIST....they care nothing at all for the love of Christ, only to have it for a cloak, that they can talk about it, and so COVER UP THEIR SINS." ("Revival Lectures")
 
"...how universalists have stumbled for want of consideration upon the subject! God is love! Well, without considering the attributes of this love, they infer that if God is love, he cannot hate sin and sinners. If he is merciful, he cannot punish sinners in hell, &c. Unitarians have stumbled in the same way....Severity is another attribute of benevolence. 'Behold,' says the apostle, 'the goodness and severity of God.' They greatly err who suppose that benevolence is all softness under all circumstances. Severity is not cruelty, but is love manifesting strictness, rigor, purity, when occasion demands. Love is universal good-will, or willing the highest good of being in general. When, therefore, any one, or any number, so conduct themselves as to interfere with and endanger the public good, severity is just as natural, and as necessary to benevolence, as kindness and forbearance, under other circumstances. Christ is not only a lamb, but a lion. He is not only gentle as mercy, but stern as justice; not only yielding as the tender bowels of mercy, but as inflexibly stern as infinite purity and justice. He exhibits the one attribute or the other, as occasion demands....God is represented in the Bible as being slow to anger, and of tender mercy; as being very pitiful; long-suffering; abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands; forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; but also visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and that will by no means clear the guilty; AND as being angry with the wicked every day. These are by no means contradictory representations. They only express the different qualities of benevolence, and represent it as manifesting itself under different circumstances, and in different relations....It is one of the most shallow of dreams, that the Divine character is all softness and sweetness, in all its manifestations and in all circumstances. Sin has 'enkindled a fire in the Divine anger that shall set on fire the foundations of the mountains, and shall burn to the lowest hell.' Severity is also always, and necessarily, an attribute of benevolence in good angels, and in good men. When occasions arise that plainly demand it, this attribute must be developed and manifested, or benevolence must cease. It is, indeed, impossible that good-will to the whole should not manifest severity and indignation to the part which should rebel against the interests of the whole....Why, then, should we seek to represent God's character as all made up of one attribute? It is, indeed, all comprehensively expressed in one word, love. But it should be for ever remembered, that this is a word of vast import, and that this love possesses, and, as occasions arise, develops and manifests, a great variety of attributes; all harmonious, and perfect, and glorious. This attribute always develops itself in the character of holy men, when occasions occur that demand it. Behold the severity of Peter in the case of Ananias and Sapphira. Witness the rebuke administered by Paul to Peter, when the latter dissembled and endangered the purity of the church. Witness also his severity in the case of Elymas the sorcerer; and hear him say to the Galatians, 'I would that they who trouble you were even cut off,' - and many such like things in the conduct and spirit of holy men. Now, I know that such exhibitions are sometimes regarded as un-Christlike, as legal, and not evangelical. But they are evangelical. These are only manifestations of an essential attribute of benevolence, as every one must see, who will consider the matter. It very often happens that such manifestations, whatever the occasions may be, are denounced as the manifestations of a wicked spirit, as anger, and as sinful anger. Indeed, it seems to be assumed by many, that every kind and degree of anger is sinful, as a matter of course. But so far is all of this from the truth, that occasions often, or at least sometimes arise, that call for such manifestations; and to be any otherwise than indignant, to manifest any other than indignation and severity, were to be and manifest anything but that which is demanded by the occasion. I know that this truth is liable, in a selfish world, to abuse. But I know also that it is a truth of revelation; and God has not withheld it for fear of its being abused. It is a truth of reason, and commends itself to the intuitions of every mind. It is a truth abundantly manifested in the moral and providential government of God. Let it not be denied nor concealed; but let no one abuse and pervert it." ("Lectures on Systematic Theology," 1851)
 
"The love required toward our neighbor is certainly not complacency in his character. Complacency is approbation and delight in character; but our Lord makes no distinction between the good and the bad, and therefore He requires us to love them all. But it cannot be that He requires us to approve and delight in the character of bad men; and hence we must conclude that the love of complacency is not in His mind, and is not the thing He requires. To have complacency in the character of wicked men as wicked, IS TO BE AS BAD AS THEY. This no reasonable man can suppose to be what the Savior requires, or what He interprets the law of God to require. Again, it is not the love of fondness which we sometimes feel towards particular individuals. Some persons are naturally pleasing to certain other persons; some are so to all, being naturally amiable and adapted to awaken pleasing emotions. But this is not the love referred to in the text....Positively, this love to our neighbor is and must be good-will. God's love to man is good-will - a pure and strong interest in his welfare, a desire for his happiness, and the positive willing of his happiness as the object dearest to his heart. The way in which His great love has manifested itself proves this. Our very reason affirms that this is the love God has borne and now bears to our race. Consequently we must conclude that this is the love which He requires men to exercise towards each other." 
("On Love To Our Neighbor," 1860)
 
J. C. Ryle (1816-1900) writes:
 
"But what kind of love is this with which the Father regards all mankind? IT CANNOT BE A LOVE OF COMPLACENCY, or else He would cease to be a perfect God. He is one who cannot bear that which is evil. Oh, no! The world-wide love of which Jesus speaks is a love of kindness, pity, and compassion....While as a righteous Judge He hates sin, He is yet able in a certain sense to love sinners!"("Do You believe?")
 
James P. Boyce (in 1887) writes:
 
"The second kind of love, is the love of benevolence, which corresponds to the idea of God's goodness towards his creatures. This is the product of his wishes for their happiness. It is not dependent on their character, as is the love of complacency, but is exercised towards both innocent and guilty."
("Abstract of Systematic Theology")
 
Arthur Tappan Pierson (1837-1911) writes: 
 
"So there are two kinds of love. We call them the love of complacence and the love of benevolence. Complacence means a feeling of pleasure. You love a beautiful person, a lovely character, because you see something in the person and in the character that draws out your love. But that is not the kind of love that we call the love of benevolence, for such love is bestowed on people in whom we do not see anything beautiful or lovely. We love them for the sake of the good that we may do them, and for the sake of the beautiful character that, by grace, we may help to develop in them."
 
In conclusion, the following Scriptures show that it would be SIN for Christians to "love homosexuals" in the manner in which many people mean it today. To love homosexuals in this fashion (i.e. delight in them) would be to hate the Lord:
 
Psalms 97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil...
 
Psalms 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. 
 
Psalms 119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
 
Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
 
Psalms 15:1 LORD, WHO SHALL ABIDE in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 
3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 
4 IN WHOSE EYES A VILE PERSON IS CONTEMNED; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD....
 
James 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a FRIEND OF THE WORLD is the ENEMY of God.

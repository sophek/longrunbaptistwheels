            AMERICA: JOSEPH'S EGYPT FADING

Revelation 3:8 I know thy works: behold, I HAVE SET BEFORE THEE AN OPEN
DOOR, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast
kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

Genesis 47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also
our fathers.
4 They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to SOJOURN in the land are we come;
for thy servants have no pasture for their FLOCKS; for the famine is sore
in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell
in the land of GOSHEN.
5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are
come unto thee:
6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy
father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwellâ€¦

We must be careful to avoid the erroneous method of interpretation that
misses the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Israel in the
Tribulation Period, and the subsequent blessing of literal Jews in the
Messianic, Millennial Kingdom. These prophecies are found presented in the
Old Testament in both a literal and typical manner. For example, it should
be obvious that Daniel in the Lion's Den (and his subsequent restoration
and exaltation) is a picture of "Jacob's Trouble" in the coming
Tribulation Period, followed by the regathering and receiving of the Jews
as predicted in Romans 11, Zechariah 12, etc. We also see in Daniel a
picture of the death, burial, resurrection and exaltation of our Lord. But
it would be a dry, stale interpreter, indeed, that could not also find
devotional teachings and illustrations for modern Christians (in this age)
in the Old Testament:

Romans 15:4 For whatsoever things were WRITTEN AFORETIME were written for
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
have hope.

2 Timothy 3:16 ALL SCRIPTURE is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness:
17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good
works.

1 Corinthians 10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples:
and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world
are come.

The Old Testament reveals to us the ways of God in regard to His people.
God does not change in regard to His holiness, perfection, etc. Therefore,
it is no wonder, that although we are in a new dispensation, and there are
some changes in this age of God's grace and patience, there is also much
that is the same. For example, Godâ€™s dealings with Gentile nations and
cities in the Old Testament was not much different than how He deals with
them today. Things are perhaps a bit more complicated, since in the midst
of the nations today, we have both natural Israel in blindness and
judgment, as well as the spiritual family of God (i.e. Christians, both
Jews and Gentiles). Christians are now the Lordâ€™s lightbearers in the
world, called to shine forth His truth and righteousness. We are called to
be pilgrims or sojourners, passing through this brief, wicked age in
patience and holiness. And this brings us to the above verses in Genesis
47.

Jacob and his sons were suffering under a terrible famine. After the
revelation of Joseph, they were called to Egypt where they were nourished
and preserved. Egypt is, therefore, both a type of the world and its
bondage, as well as a means of Godâ€™s preservation in the midst of trials,
famine, etc. Our Lord Himself was temporarily preserved as a child in
Egypt:

Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into EGYPT, and be thou there until I bring thee
word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

Joseph's brethren confessed to Pharaoh that they were only "sojourners" in
Egypt (47:4). By God's wonderful, amazing Providence, they receive the
best of the land in Egypt for their FLOCKS, and they are preserved from
the worldwide famine.

The same God who preserved and blessed His people in the Old Testament is
still alive in this age of grace. In the midst of persecution, famine and
trial, He led our forefathers, and their flocks, to a new land in America.
For example, Baptists, who had been persecuted in every other land, began
to THRIVE (along with other, American Christians) after the American
Revolution. Just as Joseph's brethren petitioned Pharaoh for Goshen, these
early American Christians secured the First Amendment through their
importunate prayers to God, and importunate petitions to civil leaders.
The provincial Congress of 1774 declared on December 9th:

"On reading of the memorial of the Rev. Isaac Backus, agent of to the
Baptist Churches in this government, 'Resolved, that the establishment of
civil and religious liberty to each denomination in the province is the
sincere wish of this Congress; but being by no means vested with the
powers of civil governmentâ€¦they therefore recommend to the Baptist
Churches that when a General Assembly shall be covened in this Colony,
they lay the real grievances of said churches before the same; when and
where their petition will most certainly meet with all the attention due
to the memorial of a denomination of Christians so well disposed to the
public weal of their country - by order of Congress, John Hancock."

Subsequent events pushed the issue aside until an address was presented to
Washington in 1789:

"In August, 1789, therefore a committee of the Baptist churches in
Virginia presented an address to General Washingtonâ€¦wherein they
expressedâ€¦'a fear that our RELIGIOUS RIGHTS were not well secured in our
new Constitution of government.' In answer to this he assured them of his
readiness to use his influence to make these rights indispensableâ€¦In the
following month, accordingly, an amendment to the Constitution was passed
declaring that Congress should 'make no law respecting any establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'"
(Curtis, "Progress of Baptist Principles," 1855)

It is for these reasons (and others) that the Baptists, long persecuted
and depised, were nevertheless, soon "standing before Pharaoh," reaping
the praise of scholars and historians as the chief defenders of religious
liberty!:

"Freedom of conscience, unlimited freedom of mind, was from the first the
trophy of the Baptists." (George Bancroft, "History of the United States,"
1840)

"The Baptists were the first propounders of absolute liberty, just and
true liberty, equal and impartial liberty." (John Locke)

As Joseph, after a life of sore persecution, was exalted in Egypt to be a
blessing to the entire world, so were Baptists, for the first time in
history, permitted to thrive unmolested. Christianity (especially Bible
Christianity) prospered abundantly. Like Israel, Baptists were given a
place for their FLOCKS to thrive in America, and they began to multiply
exceedingly:

Genesis 47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
GOSHEN; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and MULTIPLIED
EXCEEDINGLY.
 
Baptists (who had almost no churches in the South in the 18th century),
soon became the largest denomination in America at the start of the 19th
century! They were very influential.

We should not miss this picture. The Egyptians (with Joseph in their
midst) had never fully repented of idolatry. The whole land never fully
adopted the Hebrew religion. The pagan, Egyptian priests were still in the
land, enjoying the physical blessings wrought by Joseph's wisdom:

Genesis 47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this
day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the
PRIESTS only, which became not Pharaoh's.

But the amazing thing is that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were MIGHTILY
INFLUENCED by Joseph and his God. They did not owe their physical
salvation (from the famine) to any Egyptian deity, AND THEY KNEW IT!

What a precious parallel this is. It cannot be denied that many of the
famous forefathers of this country were Masons, Deists, etc. (e.g.
Washington was a Mason, and Franklin was both a Mason and a Deist). But,
like Pharoah, and much of Egypt, they had experienced miraculous blessings
from the God of the Bible. Many of the Founding Fathers were truly
converted. And those who were not, nevertheless were quick to confess
their debt to Godâ€™s Providence. By "God" they meant the God of the Bible.

Although Joseph was probably surrounded with images of Horus (the
falcon-headed, Egyptian god), and his eye, (Eye of Horus), the INFLUENCE
Joseph had upon Egypt and its leaders was God-ordained and miraculous! In
the same manner, whatever pagan forces were at work when America was
founded, and whatever pagan or Masonic symbols were utilized (e.g. the
Great Seal, etc.), it should not be denied that God ordained America to be
a GOSHEN to Christians. Like Egypt under Joseph, America soon became a
miraculous "open door" to spread the "BREAD OF LIFE" into all the FAMINED
lands:

Genesis 41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people
cried to Pharaoh FOR BREAD: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go
unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened
all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed
sore in the land of Egypt.
57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
that the famine was so sore in all lands.

Egypt was not able to provide this bread through its own power or wisdom.
It was only able to be a blessing to the whole world BECAUSE OF JOSEPH
(who was simply an instrument of God).

How could it be that Hebrew shepherds could one day thrive in Egypt?
Shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians:

Genesis 46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
shall say, What is your occupation?
34 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our
youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in
the land of Goshen; for EVERY SHEPHERD IS AN ABOMINATION UNTO THE
EGYPTIANS.

Nevertheless, God was able to ordain things in such a manner that these
shepherds were given the BEST land of Egyptian in which to prosper in, and
multiply. As Egypt was used as an instrument to protect the men of Israel,
Egypt was also, in turn, greatly blessed by Joseph and Jacob. Without
Joseph, Egypt would have starved to death in the famine. Jacob also
"blessed" Pharaoh:

Genesis 47:10 And Jacob BLESSED Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

Now notice the parallels with America. Is it not obvious that any indepth
studies of Egyptian paganism, in order to prove that GOSHEN was a PAGAN
kingdom, would be greatly beside the point? Goshen was a GOD-ORDAINED land
of nourishment and protection for God's people in the midst of famine. The
pagans were used as instruments, and instead of the paganism influencing
Jacob and his sons, the reverse was, in fact, the truth (at least at
first). By God's power, Pharaoh had to let go of the reins! He let Joseph
drive, and whatever Joseph, with his Divine wisdom, wanted, he received.
The land of Egypt was temporarily, indirectly ruled by a small band of
Hebrews who had the true religion. In the same manner, any indepth studies
of early America, in order to prove that America was founded by occult
forces and pagan Masons, etc., is greatly beside the point. God used a
gathering of Christians, Deists, Masons (and who knows what else?) to form
a country that was as much aware of its dependance upon the God of the
CHRISTIAN religion, as Pharaoh and all of Egypt was aware that they were
dependant upon Joseph and his Hebrew God! The speeches, the prayers, the
documents, the letters, the public sermons in early America, all reveal a
nation deeply impressed and aware of its dependance upon the God of the
Bible.

Who could have imagined that such a thing could transpire? Joseph as the
leader of Egypt? Jacob and his shepherd-sons given royal treatment and
privileges in the mightiest kingdom on earth? And likewise, who could have
imagined BAPTISTS in early America being blessed and protected to such a
degree that they soon MULTIPLY and become the largest Christian sect (in
the 19th century)?

Based on this typical analogy, let us now notice the tension that must be
held between two extreme views. Jacob and his sons confessed that they
were only "sojourners" in the land (Genesis 47:4). Jacob made Joseph sware
that he would not bury him permanently in Egypt:

Genesis 47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called
his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with
me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt,
and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast
said.

And Joseph, likewise, made a similar demand upon the children of Israel:

Genesis 50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will
surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he
sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will
surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

Therefore, although Egypt was a great blessing to Jacob and his sons, and
although it was greatly used in God's Providence, Israel in these early
days of prosperity never lost the greater hope! Is it not amazing that the
"glory days" of premillennialism and hope in the Second Coming, coincided
with America's independence and prosperity? In this we see our first
warning and lesson. What if Jacobâ€™s descendants would have started seeing
Egypt as "the land of promise"? What if they would have forgotten the
promises and the prophecies? Did God intend Egypt and Goshen to be the
fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? Certainly not!
Did God intend them to lose sight of their future and "settle down" in
Egypt? Certainly not.

In this we see the post-millennial, dominionist errors, the old Roman
Catholic error, and the preterist error. These teachings focus on THIS
world to such an extent that they would have Jacob and their sons
abandoning their shepherding occupation in order to â€œintermingleâ€ among
the Egyptians. They would tell Jacob and his sons, "Dominion is your
obligation. Egypt, in the present, is your ultimate goal. Intermingle
among the Egyptians and rule them. Egypt is the fulfillment of the
prophecies to your forefathers. Cast off the pilgrim spirit! It is too
negative." In other words, this erroneous view makes TOO MUCH of America.
It is patriotism perverted into idolatry. Samuel Davies Baldwin, a
Methodist minister, in 1858, was an example of this extreme view
concerning America:

"Our country is true and faithful. It has never enacted a single law
unauthorized by the DIVINE constitution; nor have the decisions of our
supreme judiciary ever been counter to the revealed legislation of
heaven."
("Dominion; or, the Unity and Trinity of the Human Race," 1858)

This is the view that is blind to the evils that run rampant in a nation
and its government. It is very gullible. It ignores the prophecies.

There is, however, an extreme view on the other side. It would tell Jacob
and his sons, "Stay out of Egypt. If you must go, do not appear before
Pharaoh. Rebuke Joseph. This whole journey down to Egypt is a plan created
by Satan. The bread of Egypt is poison. It is a trick. Pharaoh is wicked,
and we should have no dealings whatsoever with him or the Egyptians." But
this view would not be in harmony with Scripture:

Genesis 45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and
to save your lives by a great deliverance.
8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me
a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all
the land of Egypt.

Genesis 50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.
And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

In other words, this view would totally miss the wonderful Providence of
God, in turning the heart of Pharaoh towards Israel, and sustaining God's
people. In regard to America, this view would see the whole founding of
the country as a Satanic conspiracy. It would scoff at the open door of
opportunities. It would say, "See, there is a Pharaoh is coming that will
not even remember Joseph. Therefore, Joseph should have never went down to
Egypt. He should have let his family starve to death in the Promised Land.
He should have let the whole world starve. God is in control. If God wants
people to be fed, He will take care of it. If God wants babies delivered
from abortion, He will do it. If God wants souls delivered from eternal
damnation, He will take care of it. America has been a terrible mistake.
Let's just stick our heads in a hole, live for pleasure, eat, drink, and
be merry, and keep everything easy-going as the world starves."

No, God has always used kings and leaders for His wonderful purposes IN
SPITE of their evil intentions (real or imagined):

Proverbs 21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers
of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

On this 4th of July, 2004, we must therefore be thankful that the Lord has
raised up America, and has allowed an open door of religious liberty in
order for His people to multiply and prosper, and raise up their "flocks."
We must certainly never lose sight of the coming of the Lord and HIS
Kingdom. We must never forget that we are called to be sojourners:

1 Peter 1:17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of YOUR SOJOURNING
HERE in fear:

1 Peter 2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as STRANGERS AND PILGRIMS,
abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

But we should recognize God's hand of Providence in our country and be
thankful for it. We must tell our children the great things God did in
this country. We must remember the amazing, wonderful miracles of His
Providence that brought so many leaders and people to confess their faith,
dependance and gratitude to the God of the Bible, and therefore found
their nation on Christian principles. We must not allow this incredible
history to be altered, denied or perverted.

But we also must not be carried away into a false idealism, a
hyper-patriotism that is unbiblical. We must not lose sight of the
prophecies and the promises. Egypt under Pharaoh (even with the blessings
of Joseph) is NOT the Promised Land. We must remember the END of the
story:

Exodus 1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
8 Now THERE AROSE UP A NEW KING OVER EGYPT, WHICH KNEW NOT JOSEPH.
12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
 
Jacob stayed in Goshen - "in" Egypt, but not really "of" it. As
Christians, we must also keep ourselves separate (2 Corinthians 6) in a
Biblical manner, without retreating into laziness, burying our talents
into the earth, hiding our light, letting the salt lose its savour. Let us
pray and strive for the Biblical balance. Let us avoid, on one side, the
extremes of Preterism, Roman Catholicism and Dominion/Post Millennial
theology, and on the other side, the view of a few dispensationalists that
since the whole world ends in apostasy and the Antichrist, any attempt to
do anything at all to better people is sin. But our Lord went about doing
good, WHILE He preached the Gospel, and called people to hope in the world
to come:

Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
power: who WENT ABOUT DOING GOOD, and healing all that were oppressed of
the devil; for God was with him.

Let us pray for or country, and do what we can to take advantage of the
liberties that are still left. And when the door shuts, and we have done
all to stand, let us continue to STAND!

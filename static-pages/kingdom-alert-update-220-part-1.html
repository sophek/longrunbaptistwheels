"PRAY DAY" OUTSIDE THE BALLPARK! 
****************************************

Christians will be gathering outside the Ranger stadium in Arlington, TX,
at 6:00 pm on Sunday, September the 14th, to preach, pray, and be a
testimony for Jesus against, "Gay Day at the Ballpark." The Rangers helped
organize this "Gay Day" while at the same time playing the same game that
Disney and others have played: Having a "gay day," but not recognizing it
"officially." This keeps everyone passive, who might otherwise be stirred
to take a stand. We recently discussed the double-speak of the Rangers on
American Family Radio (for an hour on Friday); we alerted listeners to
this event that is being called a "showdown" by the local media:
http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/opinion/6707634.htm Some pastors are
coming to pray outside the ballpark at 6:00pm, instead of having a normal
evening service. Others will be preaching and holding signs, etc. Please
come! Below is a new article from the homosexual community which sums up
the details of the past few weeks. Please pray.

HOMOSEXUALS EXPLAIN GAY DAY SHOWDOWN
******************************************************

THE DALLAS VOICE: "Gay Day set for Sunday at Ballpark - Independent
Baptist church in Venus organizes protest; gay groups see gains in
promotion - By Angela Geralds - The Texas Rangers and Oakland A's will
take the field Sunday evening, but the battle between two other
longstanding rivals â€” the gay community and the religious right â€” has
generated the most pre-game hype. Game time is scheduled at 7:05 p.m. on
Sunday at The Ballpark in Arlington. But the controversy about a ticket
sales promotion involving gay community groups has raged for at least two
weeks. Earlier this summer, a representative of the Texas Rangers sales
force contacted Gil Flores, service director of the John Thomas Gay and
Lesbian Community Center, and asked if Flores would organize a group
ticket sale to the gay community. Flores agreed and enlisted six other gay
organizations to participate with the Resource Center of Dallas, which
operates the community center. 'They [the Rangers] said we could market it
any way we wanted,' Flores said. 'So we told them we'd market it as Gay
Day at the Ballpark.' Representatives of the gay groups met to coordinate
the event in a suite provided by the Rangers. That was too much for Rick
Warden and others affiliated with Kingdom Baptist Church in Venus, who
have organized a protest of the event. Warden, who owns a Mansfield house
painting and drywall repair business, has railed against the event on
local talk radio programs and on a Web site set up by the protesters,
called Protestgayday.com. Warden said his group is protesting Gay Day at
the Ballpark because his group sees the event as an effort by the gay
community to use a family-oriented environment to 'legitimize their
perverted lifestyles.' The group is also protesting the Rangers for
working with the gay community to organize the promotion. Rangers
representatives said such group promotions are common, ranging from the
Jewish Community Center to the Boy Scouts of America. Warden and Flores
faced off Monday night on Sports Radio 1310 AM....A Texas Rangers
representative was invited to appear on the two-hour program, but the team
declined, e-mailing a statment that said the gay community is being
treated no differently than any other group that buys tickets. Warden and
Texas Rangers president and CEO Mike Cramer appeared Tuesday evening on
The Scott Wilder Show on The Word 100.7 FM, a religious-oriented station.
On the program, Cramer said the Texas Rangers are not holding a Gay Day
but confirmed the organization is selling a block of tickets to gay
groups. A Dallas Voice headline over a July 25 story about the event was
raised during the program. Cramer said the headline, 'Rangers to hold Gay
Day,' was untrue, but the Rangers president said he would not formally
request that the newspaper issue a correction. Dallas Voice editor Dennis
Vercher said the newspaper would not issue a correction or retraction. 'A
Rangers representative got this promotion going.' Vercher said, 'The team
said the groups could promote it any way they wished, and the gay groups
informed the team early on of their intention to market it as Gay Day at
the Ballpark. It was only after the protest began that the Rangers
developed cold feet about the particular name.' In an e-mail exchange, the
Rangers president spoke of Warden's 'misguided, personal vendetta against
the gay community and the Texas Rangers' and expressed thanks that
Warden's '15 minutes of abused time on a very narrow stage will soon be at
an end.' Flores called Warden 'an uneducated person who is a little
misguided,' and said he has misstated some facts regarding the event. And
he said despite Cramer's statements, the team continues to support efforts
by the gay community groups. 'The big-wigs panic at anything, but they're
still being very supportive,' Flores said of Rangers. Flores said staff
members affiliated with the team have assured him that 'this stuff
happens' and 'it's no big deal.' The Rev. Joey Faust, pastor of Kingdom
Baptist Church, said just as gays have the right to organize an event at
the ball park, his church has the right to protest homosexuality. Kingdom
is an Independent Baptist church, with views similar to the Southern
Baptist Convention....On the church's website, www.kingdombaptist.org,
Faust directs mothers to stay home and raise their children, and says
children should be home-schooled. Members are admonished to 'refrain from
worldly TV and movies' and are advised, 'The safest way to accomplish this
is to totally remove the TV from the home.' Women are instructed to 'be
silent in the mixed assembly (except for singing)' and members are
encouraged to be involved in 'door-to-door evangelism or street witnessing
weekly.' Faust said other churches are planning to send busloads of
protesters, and Warden said several Christians will kneel in prayer
outside the ball park for a 'Pray Day.' Flores said he is never surprised
when a gay event attracts demonstrators, because people have 'very strong
feelings about sexuality.' But Flores added, 'I didnâ€™t think it was going
to be this big of a deal.' Although the event has received more flak than
gay community coordinators expected, 'I don't think it's necessarily all
negative,' Flores said. Coverage of the controversy has caused more
'middle-of-the-road heterosexual people' to become allies of the gay
community, Flores said. 'When they realize there are people out there so
far to the right, they really want to stand up and support us,' he said.
'We've actually had heterosexual people call us and buy tickets because
they wanted to stand up and speak out.' Flores said the organizations had
originally hoped to sell 1,000 tickets, but have pared back their
expectations. As of midweek, about 200 tickets had been sold, he said.
Rangers tickets are regularly $12, Flores said, and tickets for Gay Day
will also be $12. But since the Rangers are selling the tickets to the gay
organizations for half-price, the gay community groups get to keep $6 from
each ticket sold. Other groups selling tickets include the Dallas
Independent Volleyball Association, Dallas Diablos rugby team, Pegasus
Slowpitch Softball Association, North Texas Women's Sports Association,
Texas Gay Rodeo Association and Series 2004, the committee responsible for
organizing next year's gay softball world series. The game was originally
scheduled in the afternoon, but game time was changed to 7:05 p.m. so ESPN
can televise playoff-bound Oakland. According to the Texas Rangers Web
site and ESPN listings, the game will be seen on ESPN 2. To purchase
tickets in advance, contact a participating organization or call
214-540-4425. To purchase tickets at the game, ask for seats in sections
330 or 331."

"Worlld's smallest microchip unveiled - Malaysia has bought the rights
from a Japanese firm to the world's smallest microchip that can be
embedded in everything from currencies to human bodies.
Announcing this on Thursday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Muhammad
said the microchip would boost the global 'anti-terror' war....Measuring
0.5 of a square mm and produced at less than 0.38 ringgit (10 cents) each,
the chip - the size of a dot - uses the radio frequency identification

ONE EFFECT OF TV ON CHILDREN
**********************************
"Going steady at the age of seven - Children as young as seven are 'going
out' with each other - sometimes for years at a time. Sociologist Emma
Renold, from Cardiff University, says relationships between primary
school-age children are common. She thinks as many as a fifth of primary
school children 'go out' together...." (BBC News)

YAWNING, BLINKING, SMILING, CRYING....IN THE WOMB!
**********************************************************
"Pioneering scanning techniques have produced astonishing images from
inside the womb which show babies apparently smiling and crying. Experts
believe the breakthrough could lead to advances in baby health for a whole
range of conditions, including Down's Syndrome....The ultra-sound scanning
techniques capture images which show the foetuses yawn, blink, suck their
fingers and seem to cry and smile. Up to now, doctors did not think
infants made such expressions until after birth and believed they learned
to smile by copying their mother. The procedure has been pioneered by
London obstetrician Professor Stuart Campbell at the Create Health Centre
for Reproduction and Advanced Technology. His pictures reveal foetuses
moving their limbs at just eight weeks."

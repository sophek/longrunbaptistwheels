HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE: WHY IT IS TRULY SATANIC (Pt.2) 

This is a continuation of last week's review of Rowling's Harry Potter series. If a pastor preaches against worldly TV and worldly movies and books, Harry Potter is not a problem. The families in his church will not be blown about by every wind of entertainment that flies through. But right now, around the world, there are FUNDAMENTALISTS with multiple families in their churches who allow their children to read the Potter books. As an aid to these pastors, fathers and mothers, I have put together these studies. Please do everything you can to reprove and rebuke this evil: 

Ephesian 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. 
12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 

I have done my very best to reprove the trash in these Potter books while keeping the crude details to the barest minimum. 



HARRY POTTER: ALEISTER CROWLEY'S MODEL SORCERER 

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was a heroin addict, sodomite, pervert and witch. He also stalked around in black cloaks. He called himself "the Beast" of the Book of Revelation: 

"Before I touched my teens, I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose number is 666." (Crowley, "Magick In Theory and Practice," pp.xi, xii) 

Crowley has been idolized by rock groups such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Ozzy. There is an even greater interest in his works today that has been spawned by the Harry Potter books: 


"Outside the workplace, the Harry Potter series of adult-read children's books has helped fuel a revival of British interest in the occult. The British Satanist Aleister Crowley and his growing band of disciples were recently featured in a television documentary on witchcraft as a kind of lifestyle choice."(May 9, 2001, James Woudhuysen, Spiked-Online) 

There is indeed a deep connection between Crowley and the Potter books. It was Crowley's goal to make magic "acceptable": 

"I found myself at a loss for name to designate my work, just as H.P. Blavatsky some years earlier...I chose therefore the name 'Magick'...I swore to rehabilitate magick...to compel mankind to respect, love, and trust that which they scorned, hated and feared...I must make magick the essential factor in the life of all." (Crowley, "Magick In Theory and Practice," pp.xi, xii) 

Rowling names a character after Blavatsky. No one can read the first few chapters of the first Potter book without realizing that it is also Rowling's agenda to make magic acceptable! She mocks those who fear it or despise it as evil. By doing so, she mixes fiction with reality in a manner that makes a statement. She does the same elsewhere: 

"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago...They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution." ("Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," p.150) 

Since her books are set in the present, Rowling is mixing real historical witchcraft with the witchcraft in her fiction. She thus places her philosophy in the strategic framework of fiction, just like Albert Pike says all true occultists have done for centuries. 

Notice another connection between Potter and Crowley. Crowley explains the maturation process of a sorcerer: 

"Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers. Even his idea of his limitations is based on experience of the past, and every step in his progress extends his empire." (Ibid., p.xvi) 

Harry Potter, in Rowling's first book, lives his life in total ignorance of his past and his true ability until he finds out he is a wizard (p.50). He finds this out at the exact same age Crowley found out he was supposedly "the Beast" of Revelation. Harry goes through the next few years in a clumsy sort of way, "discovering himself." 

Harry began to find out he was a wizard at age eleven: 

"It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard...." ("Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," p.20) 

Why eleven? Is there any other connection to Crowley other than the fact that this was the same age he supposedly discovered his occult identity? Yes. But first notice the length of Harry's wand: 

"Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop...at last he had found one that suited him - this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long and contained a single feather from the phoenix..." ("Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," p.310) 

Now notice the following words of Crowley concerning the number 11: 

"...11 is the number of Magick in itself..." (Ibid, p.86) 

In 1904 in Cairo, Crowley was supposedly contacted by a spirit guide (i.e. devil) called Aiwass. Aiwass dictated the "Liber AL Legis" or "The Book of the Law" to Crowley. The book announced that mankind had now entered a new Aeon (i.e. the Age of Horus). Crowley writes: 

"...[eleven] is the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon. As it is written in the Book of the Law: 'Eleven, as all their numbers who are of us.'" (Ibid., p.86) 

But there is an even greater connection between Potter and Crowley's Satanic philosophy. In every Potter book, Potter is presented as a sort of rebel. He does not obey his step-parents. But then when he gets to school, he doesn't obey his wizard teachers either! But in spite of all their scolding, they usually end up "winking" at Harry's refusal to follow orders. In fact, we find out later, that all the "good" wizards who are Harry's role models also have a streak of independence and rebellion. Before we examine the connection between this and Crowley's witchcraft, let's document Harry's rebellion: 

"'Very well,' said Professor McGonagall prompting him as he paused, 'so you found out where the entrance was - breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way...Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles...'I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore. Ron opened his mouth in horror. 'Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,' Dumbledore went on, smiling. 'You will both receive Special Awards for Services...'" ("Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", p.328-331) 

"'Don't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter's determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here." (p.276) 

"You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all..." (p.677) 

This same streak of rebellion is seen in all the "good" wizard role models in Harry's life: 

"'It's all right,' said Moody, sitting down...'Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been." (p.343) 

"'Who's he, to lecture me about being out-of bounds?' said Harry...'After all the stuff he [Sirius] did at school!'" (p.572) 

"Wouldn't Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we'd seen the curses?' Harry asked...'Yeah, probably,' said Ron. 'But Dumbledore's always done things his way, hasn't he, and Moody's been getting in trouble for years, I reckon..." (p.220) 

Notice now the connection between Potter and Crowley's philosophy. Not only is a sorcerer ignorant at first, and must find his way to self-discovery (like Potter), but he must also disobey ANY rules that get in the way of this self-discovery: 

"One of the many attractions of Crowley's type of Magick, was this advice to follow one's own way and create your own life style. You don't need a priest or a judge to tell you how to act - work it out for yourself...." ("Fact Sheet on Crowley") 

Crowley writes: 

"Every man and woman is a star. That is to say...every man and woman has a course, depending partly on self, and partly on the environment...Anyone who is forced from his own course, either from not understanding himself, or through external opposition, comes into conflict with the order of the Universe, and suffers accordingly...Man is capable of being and using, anything which he perceives, for everything that he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being. He MAY thus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is conscious to his individual Will." (Ibid., pp. xiv-xvii) 

Don't miss that paragraph. It is crucial to understanding Harry Potter. Potter has been bound up in ignorance through living with Muggles. Once he finds his proper path, Potter then uses the castle, the students, and whatever else he finds in his way, without regard to rules or regulations, in an effort to find himself and "progress". 

Crowley continues: 

"Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is...To insist that any one else shall comply with one's own standards is to outrage, not only him, but oneself...Every man has a right to fulfill his own will without being afraid that it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in his place, it is the fault of others if they interfere with him...If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny to control Europe, he should not be blamed for exercising his rights...I trust that they will understand, not only the reasonableness, but the necessity of the fundamental truth which I was the means of giving to mankind: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law...One must find out for oneself, and make sure beyond doubt, who one is, what one is, why one is....In the course of this TRAINING, he will learn to explore the Hidden Mysteries of Nature, and to develop new senses and faculties in himself..." (Ibid., pp. xvi-xxv) 

The reader of the above sentence will now understand Harry Potter, and also understand why the Devil has allowed it to become so amazingly popular. Harry Potter is Crowley's ultimate child! People (especially children) are taught not to "interfere" with the New Age occult transformation of society that is upon us. This is indeed the "moral" lesson that Rowling gives in her fourth book: 

"Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open...'It is my belief - and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken - that we are all facing dark and difficult times." (pp.723-24) 

The "dark times" will no doubt include the RESISTANCE that many will be making to this New Age philosophy perverting the minds of our precious children. In reality, the Bible says the "dark times" are the present revival of witchcraft and sorcery and God's imminent judgment of the world because of it (1 Tim.4:1)! 

Finally, Crowley's ideas concerning death also find their way into Rowling's Potter books. 
Crowley writes: 

"It is followed by the arising not of Isis, but of Osiris. The ancient condition is not restored, but a new and superior condition is created, a condition only rendered possible by the process of death. The Alchemists themselves taught this same truth. The first matter of the work was base and primitive, though 'natural'. After passing through various stages the 'black dragon' appeared; but from this arose the pure and perfect gold. There is no attempt to get rid of death by denying it, as among the once-born; nor to accept death as the gate of new life, as among the twice-born...life and death are equally incidents in a career, very much like day and night in the history of a planet." (Ibid., p.30) 

"...death is but through accident; thou hast hidden thyself in the shadow of thy gross body, and, taking it for reality, thou hast trembled." (Crowley, "Concerning Death") 

"In the next ceremony I show how the individual, released by death from the obsession of personality, resumes relations with the truth of the universe. Reality bursts upon him in a blaze of adorable light; he is able to appreciate its splendour as he could not previously do, since his incarnation has enabled him to establish particular relations between the elements of eternity. Finally, the cycle is closed by the reabsorption of all individuality into infinity...forming the starting point for new adventure of the same kind." (Crowley, "What Is Freemasonry") 

Rowling ends the plot of her first Potter book with these words: 


"Dumbledore smiled....'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure..." (p.297) 

Crowley does not believe in "resurrection". Rowling symbolises Crowley's occult view of death by the phoenix. Harry sees it turn to ashes and then a new bird is born before his eyes. The phoenix always plays a part in saving Harry: 

"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry...they make highly faithful pets." ("Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", p.207) 

"He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back...his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed..." ("Harry Potter and the Goblet...", p.665) 

Rowling's fifth book (not yet released) is called "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix". 

Albert Pike writes: 

"All the masters of Alchemy who have written of the Great Work, have employed symbolic and figurative expressions...to repel the profane from a work that would be dangerous for them, as to be well understood by Adepts...the entire work has for its symbols the Pelican and the PHOENIX." ("Morals and Dogma", p.774) 

"The Dove, the Raven, and the Phoenix are striking Symbols of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, and the Beauty resulting from the equilibrium of the two." (Pike, Ibid, p.792) 

If I have interpreted all this trash correctly, the phoenix represents the "beauty" that arises when good and evil, life and death, male and female, etc. are merged in a perverse, unbiblical manner (as in "Yin and Yang"). This is all part of Satan's (the Serpent's) original lie. Satan desires to be "like the Most High" (Isa.14:14). 


HARRY POTTER, OCCULTISM AND THE NUMBER FOUR 

In regard to the number four, Crowley writes: 

"Below this abyss we find the moral qualities of man, of which there are six. The highest is symbolized by the number Four. Its nature is fatherly." (Ibid. p.2) 

Albert Pike writes: 

"Four symbolizes a man bearing with himself a Divine principle." (Ibid, p.633)

"A divine number...Four represents the generative power." (Ibid, p.61, Index) 

Rowling continues to remind her readers that Harry's address is "number four": 

"As he pulled into the driveway of number four..." ("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," p.5) 

In Rowling's Hogwart's school of witchcraft there are four headmasters, four founders and four houses. In the fourth book in the series, Harry is the FOURTH challenger chosen to enter an occult contest. When they must all pick a "dragon" to get around, Harry pulls out the FOURTH one: 

"...Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four..." ("Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", p.350) 

It therefore is obvious, that in a true occult fashion (the real stuff), Rowling is describing Harry Potter as a "messiah" (i.e. antichrist): 

"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad....I wish he was mine, he's really divine. The hero who conquered the Dark Lord." ("Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets", p.238) 



HARRY POTTER AND THE OCCULT HERMES 

Crowley joined the occult "Hermetic" Order of the Golden Dawn in 1898. Where did this Hermetic wisdom come from? Pike explains that they believe Enoch (in the Bible) is the same person the Greeks called Mercury or Hermes: 

"The ancient Greeks declare that Enoch is the same as Mercury...[Hermes]...He discovered the knowledge of the Zodiac..." (Ibid, p.363) 

"Of Hermes, the Mercury of the Greeks, the Thoth of the Egyptians, and the Taaut of the Phoenicians, we have heretofore spoken sufficiently at length. He was the inventor of letters and Oratory, the winged messenger of the Gods, bearing the Caduceus wreathed with serpents..." (Ibid, p. 586) 

Supposedly this ancient Hermes was like a "messiah" whom God gave great, secret wisdom. Enoch ("Hermes" according to Masons, etc.) after teaching some occult priests, then ascended into Heaven: 

"From the bosom of Egypt sprang a man of consummate wisdom, initiated in the secret knowledge of India...named Thoth or Phtha....Hermes Trismegistrus by the Greeks...The Deity had, so to say, infused into him the sciences and the arts, in order that he might instruct the whole world...he taught men how to write down their thoughts and arrange their speech....In Egypt he instituted hieroglyphics...The Egyptian Priests related that Hermes, dying, said '....Do not weep for me: I return to that celestial country whither each goes in his turn. There is God. This life is but a death.' This is precisely the creed of the old Buddhists...who believed that from time to time God sent Buddhas on earth, to reform men..." (Ibid, p. 364-365). 

The original occult wisdom was supposedly delivered to Hermes on an EMERALD GREEN TABLET. This GREEN tablet supposedly contained the "key" to understanding the allegories, veiled fiction or symbols of the alchemists, etc.: 

"[The] Hermetic tablet of emerald contains the Key to their allegories." (Pike, Ibid, p.80, index) 

"The Hermetic Art is, therefore, at the same time a religion, a philosophy, and a natural science...as a science, we must inquire for its processes of Paracelsus [and] Nicholas Flamel....for the grand agent of the operation of the Sun, is that force described in the Symbol of Hermes, of the table [tablet] of the EMERALD; it is the universal magical power; the spiritual, fiery, motive power...Therein is the secret fire, living and philosophical, of which all Hermetic philosophers speak with the most mysterious reserve....The disciples of Hermes, before promising their adepts the elixir of long life or the power of projection, advised them to seek for the Philosophic STONE...To find the immovable bases of true religious Faith, of Philosophical Truth, and of Metallic transmutation, this is the secret of Hermes in its entirety, the Philosophical Stone...In all maladies of soul and body, a single particle from the precious stone, a single grain of the divine powder, is more than sufficient to cure him...He who desires to attain to the understanding of the Grand Word and the possession of the Great Secret, ought carefully to read the Hermetic philosophers, and will undoubtedly attain initiation..." " ("Morals and Dogma," Albert Pike, pp 774-777) 

Now one can understand the title of Rowling's first Potter book: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." The British title is "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone." One can also understand what lies behind the name "Hermione" (who is the main girl character of the books). Rowling allows children to become familiar with these words and terms. An owl is named "Hermes": 

"'So then I tried to borrow Hermes --- ' 'Who?' 'The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy...'" ("Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", p.30) 

One may also now understand why Harry Potter's eyes are GREEN and why the color green appears continually throughout the whole series. The original secrets of occult wisdom, that which unlocks the mysteries, was written on the ancient Emerald Green Tablet: 


"Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours...he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light..." (1st book, p.29) 

"Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!" (1st book, p.3) 

"She, too was wearing a cloak, an emerald one." (1st book, p.9) 

"Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes." (1st book, p.20) 

"The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink." (1st book, p. 34) 

"Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with happy Birthday harry written on it in green icing." (1st book, p. 48) 

"Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out..." (1st book, p.75) 


"Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair...He was wearing long green robes..." (2nd book, p.38) 

"With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred..." (2nd book, p.47) 

"...Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine." (2nd book, p.77) 

"...Snape took charge. 'Finite Incantatem!' he shouted...A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene." (2nd book, p.192) 

"...as he crept around the bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds." (2nd book, p.304) 

"There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled." (4th book, p.15) 

"A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes [Harry's] puzzled under his untidy black hair." (4th book, p.16) 

"'That's better,' panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes...." (4th book, p.44) 

"Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green..." (4th book, p.47) 

"...a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them." (4th book, p.122) 

"Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in haze of greenish smoke...'It's the Dark Mark, Harry!' Hermione moaned...." (4th book, p.128) 

"...Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons..." (4th book, p.175) 

"...Dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes..." (4th book, p.558) 

Therefore, "green" is the color of the dark magic; but it is also the color of the robes worn by the "good" wizards, etc. 

HARRY POTTER: THE BLASPHEMOUS POTTY MOUTH! 

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book, 1999) and "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (fourth book, 2000) continue to display language that not even a Christian ADULT should ever be found using. Yet these books are also marketed to CHILDREN. In the first book, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", the main characters (Harry, Ron and Hermione) are 11 years old. These characters age a year with every new book in the series. The latest book (the fourth) deals with the children at the age of 14. The fifth book in the series ("Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix") has not yet been released for sale (as of August 25th, 2001). 

In the first of Rowling's Potter books, the examples of profanity, swearing, and taking the Lord's name in vain, have already been documented (see pages 12, 23, 41, 69, 115, 152, 290 of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", PB). Such Biblical words as "damn" are used as profanity, and the Lord (or Heaven) is used in vain as an exclamation. Far worse profanities are implied by a blank after the words "What the". 

In the subsequent books in the series these occurrences begin to multiply rapidly. In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book), "What the ---" occurs at least three times (pages 24, 171, 337). The use of "heaven" or "Lord" in vain occurs at least twice (p.39, 197). Profanity is sometimes implied in other ways: 

"...Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly." (p.253) 

"Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore." (p.259)

In "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (fourth book, 2000, HB), "What the ---" occurs at least twice (p.128, 560). The Biblical word "damn" (used as profanity) occurs at least SEVEN TIMES (p.43, 127, 193, 232, 344, 470, 561). The Biblical word "hell" (where all witches will surely go when they die if they do not repent) is used as profanity at least twice (p.159, 626). "Heaven", "Lord", "good Lord" or "God" is used in vain as an exclamation at least eleven times (p.58, 101, 114, 169, 248, 351, 352, 538, 671, 683, 706). Profanity is sometimes implied in other ways as well: 

"Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley." (p.121) 

There are also British exclamations all through Rowling's works that are considered to be profanity. For example, in this book (4th), the word "blimey" occurs many times. (Examples can be found on pages 78, 131, 171). An "Anglicanism and British Slang Guide" states that "blimey" is the abbreviated form of "Gorblimey". "Gorblimey" means "God blind me". Thus, we have millions of children throughout the world wanting to be just like Harry, Ron and Hermione. They are now walking around saying "God blind me" as they pretend to practice spells to solve all their problems! What is worse is that some writers have pointed out that in England, words such as "bloody," "blimey," etc. that begin with the letters "BL" are offensive because they refer to the blood of Christ and His Cross. Therefore, they are commonly used as profanities. How sad it is that such British exclamations are so common throughout Rowling's books marketed toward children! 

One should also realize that (especially in later books of the series) Biblical words such as "damn" and "Hell", etc, are used by (supposed) GOOD TEACHERS and GOOD PARENTS who are the role models. The children (Ron, etc.) also begin to use such words. 

Now I ask: fathers, mothers, PASTORS, how can you refrain from preaching against these books that have taken the world's children by storm? How can you allow your children to read these books for entertainment? There is only one answer: 

Romans 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but HAVE PLEASURE IN them that do them. 

In the last days, perilous times shall come, for men shall be: 

"...lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God..." (2 Tim.3:4). 

HARRY POTTER BOOKS CONTAIN OBSCENITIES AND PERVERSIONS 

For the sake of my readers, I did not document many crude references in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in last week's article. Scenes such as a man drinking a dead unicorn's blood (p.256), etc. are too graphic and sick to quote. Many of the jokes aimed at depraved children (references to vomit, etc.) I also left out for the same reason. Such scenes only increase in later books. In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book) there is a graphic scene where the popular character Ron (12 years old) vomits slugs (p.112, 113). References to graphic death or suffering are found on pages 132 and 322, etc. Other references too crude to even mention are found on page 133. Also, in this book, "mandrakes" are plants that resemble HUMAN BABIES with plants coming out of the top of their heads. (There is an illustration of a crying baby at the head of the chapter on p.86). Notice the following quote: 

"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,' Harry heard her telling Filch....'And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them." (p.234) 

"...in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy. 'The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature, she told Harry..." (p.251) 

If you think that is clever or funny, you watch too much worldly trash on TV and your mind is perverted and warped by the Devil. 

In the fourth book, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" this type of trash continues. At a ballgame the following event occurs: 

"The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed...." (p.111) 

In this book Ron also gets in trouble in class for uttering a perverse obscenity so crude it cannot be named here (pp.201, 202). 

There is blood and gore graphically described to such an extent it cannot be quoted here on pages 642, 646, 648. 

And the "good" Christian parents continue to smile and buy these books for their precious children because they are not extremists like the fundamentalists. What sad days we are living in! 

HARRY POTTER BOOKS MIX GIRLS AND BOYS IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPROPER 

Rowling's imaginary school "Hogwarts" enrolls students from 11-17. Therefore these students are going through puberty. To preserve virginity and innocence in a Biblical manner, obedient Christians put up many "fences" for their children. Yet, Rowling presents scenes that will only incite the new desires of young teenagers. I have already revealed that in the first book, boys and girls as old as eleven walk around at night in bathrobes. Perhaps this is nothing shocking to some who are very naive and ignorant in regard to modern children. Yet, there are other examples throughout Rowling's books that go much further in indecency. The pure minds of 8-14 year old children should not be exposed to such scenes as "normal" and "acceptable". 

In the second book, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" the following scenes occur: 

"Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in...'Wake up,' she said loudly, pulling back the curtains...'Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -' said Ron..." (p.211) 

These children are supposed to be 12 years old in the above scene. Notice another scene: 

"..she spotted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody." (p.287) 

The reference is to an 11 year old girl who accidentally walks in on an older boy. He is embarrassed and asks her not to tell anyone what she has seen. Rowling allows the imagination of her young readers to wonder until the end of the book. There she reveals that the boy was kissing a girl. 

In another scene, Harry discovers that Ron and Hermione (female) are together in an abandoned bathroom, in a locked stall: 

"He couldn't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again...he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall." (p.183) 

While they are only trying to make a "potion" to transfigure into other people (as if that is not bad enough), later books reveal a romance between these two. Young teenagers should not think such conduct is acceptable - regardless of the reason. 

One of the last scenes of the book is an all night, co-ed "pajama" party for all the students (11-17): 

"Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night." (p.339) 

Such scenes increase in the fourth book, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (2000). On page 103, strange "cheerleaders" (i.e. half women, half something or other) dance before a ballgame. All the men go into a lustful trance, including Harry and Ron (14 years old). 

During a school dance (where there is much lusting) the following scene occurs; 

"Fleur [female] and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes." (p.429) 

"Fleur" (a magically beautiful, blonde girl-creature), later notices an older boy: 

"Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother's shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them." (p.616) 

The next scene crosses every line in regard to what should acceptable in so-called children's books: 

"...Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need....he also decided to use the prefect's bathroom...The door creaked open...His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom...there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she snored...Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water...Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle...'Myrtle!' Harry said in outrage, 'I'm - I'm not wearing anything!'...he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived. 'I closed my eyes when you got in,' she said...'Well...anyway [said Myrtle]...I'd try the egg in the water. That's what Cedric Diggory did.' 'Have you been spying on him too?' said Harry indignantly. 'What d'you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?' 'Sometimes,' said Myrtle, rather slyly, 'but I've never come out to speak to anyone before.'...'Myrtle, there aren't merpeople in there, are there?' 'Oooh, very good,' she said, her thick glasses twinkling, 'it took Diggory much longer than that! And that was with her awake too' - Myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face - 'giggling and showing off and flashing her fins...." (pp.458-464) 

In Rowling's magical world of witchcraft, pictures have real people in them who talk, look at you at wink back, etc. Therefore she presents the idea of a giggling, blonde mermaid in a bathroom for older boys. The rest is obvious. The female ghost is jealous of the blonde mermaid. The whole scene is perverted, especially when realizes how many impressional, young teenage boys and girls are reading these books. 

Romans 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and MAKE NOT PROVISION for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. 


REBELLION CONTINUES IN ROWLING'S LATER POTTER BOOKS 

In regard to "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", Harry's constant rebellion against all authority has been documented. There are NO good role models who obey authority anywhere in the book. Those that do obey authority are presented as hypocrites, or else Pharisaical (holding rigidly to small laws while breaking larger ones). Things only get worse in later books. 

In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book), Harry continues his obsession with lying to authority (see pages 129, 143, 159, 209). His friend Ron states: 

"'That,' said Ron fervently,' was the best story you've ever come up with.'" (p.288). 

Hermione also continues in her corruption: 

"'I never thought I'd see the day when you'd [Hermione] be persuading us to break rules,' said Ron. 'All right, we'll do it.'" (p.166) 

In "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (fourth book, 2000), Rowling continues to appeal to the innate rebellion of children: 

"'I will not be spoken to like that!' said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage. But Harry wasn't going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursely's stupid rules." (p.33) 

Harry continues to lie, once every few pages (see pp. 229, 443, 456, 577, 581, etc.). 

Ron tells his mother to "shut up". In the book she is presented as a good, model mother: 

"Mum, shut up! Ron yelled..." (p.712) 

HARRY POTTER BOOKS DEFINE SIN AND EVIL IN AN UNBIBLICAL MANNER 

Rowling often raises the concept of evil. In her second book, she writes: 

'...but Miss Hermione Granger knew my [Lockhart's] secret ambition is to rid the world of evil..." (p100) 

In the fourth book, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", plundering in other people's possessions is defined as acceptable behavior: 

"Dumbledore shook his head. 'Curiosity is not a sin,' he said." (p.598) 

But the real problem is when Rowling brings up the whole concept of sin to begin with. This is deceptive. The concept of "sin" is raised by a "good" wizard in a book filled with divination, spells, witchcraft, etc. Although this is fiction, Rowling cannot help but deal with "good" and "evil" throughout her books. This tends to teach children that people that people who practice sorcery are NOT rebellious "sinners" before God - unless they use it for blind ambition. 
The concept of morality is raised elsewhere, as well: 

"'Most of the judges,' and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, 'feel that this shows moral fiber..." (p.507) 

In a contest Harry chooses to rescue a girl his competition was supposed to rescue. Rowling then has "good" wizards (the teachers) praising Potter's morality. Children must realize that not only are things such as blind ambition, hypocrisy, partiality, and malice terrible sins - but so are sorcery, divination and witchcraft (Acts 8:9, Rev.9:21, 1 Sam.15:23, Gal.5:20)! But this is the very thing that is NOT presented. Harry lies, cheats, hates, despises authority, plots and enjoys revenge, etc. But these things are not even presented as wrong. In fact, they are the things that make Harry so "special". Thus, they become virtues. Christians must realize that Rowling IS making moral statements with her characters. And her view of morality is in great contradiction with the Bible's view of morality! 

THE POTTER BOOKS CONTINUE TO MAKE DRINKING ACCEPTABLE

Last week, I presented how the first Potter book presents moderate drinking as acceptable behavior. Her later books continue to do so. 

In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book), parents that are supposedly "good" drink continually: 

"Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink." (p.57) 

The "good" teachers also drink and it is presented as something to chuckle at: 

"...though I [ Lockhart] wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey!" (p.100) 

In "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (2000), it gets even worse. The book opens with a bar scene: 

"'Always thought he was odd,' she told the eagerly listening villagers, after the fourth sherry...'Ah, now,' said a woman at the bar...'" (p.3) 

The boy who is presented as a terrible role model by Rowling (for following rules strictly) also drinks: 

"Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine...." (p.62) 

The Weasley parents continue to drink: 

"...Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewshiskey..." (p.147) 

One teacher (from another school) offers fermented wine to an older student: 

"Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?'" (p.257) 

The head schoolmaster (who is presented as the "good" wizard and adult role model) drinks regularly: 

"You'll come and have a drink before you go, at least?' said Dumbledore." (p.281) 

The young students drink something called "butterbeer" that they order from real bars: 

"She's gone,' said Hermione...'Why don't we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks...'" (p.319) 

"The pub was crowded as ever...he [Harry] went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers..." (p.444) 

We find out later that "butterbeer' is indeed fermented; yet it is not very strong:

"She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool...As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup. 'Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,' Dobby whispered to Harry. 'Well, it's not strong, that stuff,' Harry said. But Dobby shook his head. 'Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,' he said." (p.536) 

POTTER BOOKS PRESENT WEAK HUSBANDS AND FATHERS WITH NO AUTHORITY 

I understand that this is a worldly book. I do not expect Christian morality to be found within its pages. Anything about witches should be rejected without another word. But I am presenting the evils of these books in detail due to the fact that so many CHRISTIANS are letting their children read these books. 

Harry's step-parents present a weak husband/father with no authority in his home. When we meet with Ron's model parents (the Weasleys), the "man of the house" continues to be a pathetic joke. In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book), Mrs. Weasley is the leader of her home: 

"I said no, Arthur..." (p.67) 

In "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", Mr. Weasley's older boys are gambling. They laugh off his feeble attempts to keep them from doing so (pp.88, 117). He is helpless to stop them. In fact, it appears that the main reason he wants to stop them is that their mother will be mad at him! 

Rowling has done her best to make sure she does not present an "old fashioned" (i.e. Biblical) view of women. Notice her response to a question on this subject: 

"This is a question from Bridget from Toronto, and she's 12. Bridget's wondering, 'Why did you create a magical society where men and women play such traditional roles? It seems most of the women Wizards pitter and patter around the house while the men do all the dark work.' Rowling: [laughs] That's not entirely true, because if you look at Professor McGonagall, she's a very, very powerful witch, and she's in a position of power. And in fact, if you look at the Hogwarts' staff - I had this discussion with someone the other day - it is exactly 50/50. Although it is true that you do have a headmaster as opposed to a headmistress, but that has not always been the case. As you will find out, there have been equal numbers of headmistresses..." (Radio.CBC.ca, Oct.23, 2000) 

POTTER BOOKS MOCK NEW TESTAMENT COMMANDS FOR OUTWARD APPEARANCE 

I have already shown how the first Potter book presents Muggles (those that despise magic as dangerous) as also people that believe that boys and men should have short hair. In the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (2000), the subject of hair is brought up again: 

"...Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule breaking...However, Bill was - there was no other word for it - cool. He was tall, with long hair that he tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert..." (p.52) 

Mrs. Weasley (presented as a model mom) does not "like" this appearance. Her "cool" son tells her what HE thinks about it: 

"'Mum, no one at the bank gives a _____ [obscenity] how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,' said Bill patiently....'I like it,' said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. 'You're so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it's nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore's..." (p.62) 

Dumbledore is the "good" wizard and headmaster of the school. He has long hair. The other adult role model (who children like) is Hagrid the half-giant. He also has long hair: 

"...Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair..." (p.179) 

The New Testament teaches that men should look like men and women should look like women. It teaches that in the "last days" people will even lose NATURAL affection (2Tim.3:1-5); thus, among other things, they will be so morally dull, they will not be able to tell the basic things that are right and wrong from the light of nature (conscience, etc.). Paul teaches that long hair on women and short hair on men is one of these natural things: 

1Corinthians 11:14 Doth not even NATURE itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 
15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 

Potter books teach children that it is okay to dress like a rock musician if that is what one desires. But this also leads to greater sins. 

HARRY POTTER BOOKS TEACH CHILDREN REVENGE AND HATRED OF ENEMIES 

Notice the following quotes from "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (second book): 

"It's not possible to live with the Dursely's and not hate them,' said Harry." (p.200) 

"'I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got award for special services to Hogwarts either.' 'Could've been anything,' said Ron...Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor...'" (p.232) 

"...irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw 'Gadding with Ghouls' right in Lockhart's stupid face." (p.270) 

"I hate that Skeeter woman!' she [Hermione] burst out savagely." (p.546) 

The Lord teaches Christians to act in a different manner: 

Matthew 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 

ROWLING'S USE OF THE NAMES OF REAL HISTORIC PEOPLE FOR HER CHARACTERS 

Last week I showed how Rowling names the "faithful" pet of the great wizard "Fawkes". I linked this with the Fawkes that attempted to blow up the English Parliament and stop the King James Bible from being translated and printed. Some may have thought that such a link was a "stretch". Yet, this past week I found where Rowling admits to the link: 

"How do you feel about Halloween and Guy Fawkes day? Rowling: 'That's unusual that you know about that. You got the joke about Fawkes, the Phoenix.'" (cbc4kids.ca) 

Therefore, it "probably" is not a stretch to say that when Rowling names one of the good wizards (who are zealous to capture the Dark wizards) "Moody" (see book four) it is another one of her "stabs" at fundamentalists: 

"'Mad-Eye Moody?' said George thoughtfully..'...He was an Auror - one of the best -...a Dark wizard catcher...'Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him..." (4th book, p.161) 

We would prefer her not to mingle the names of real life sorcerers with the names of real life soul winners! 

HOW ROWLING FEELS ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIANS 
"How do you feel when people try to censor your books because of their religious beliefs about witchcraft? Rowling: 'I just think they need psychiatric help. I say, honestly....can they read some of them? I think they [my books] are moral...By and large they [the characters in the book] go with their conscience which is a powerful thing....(sigh) there you go.'" (cbc4kids.ca) 

ROWLING USES SOME REAL SPELLS 
Rowling: "I decided on the school subjects very early on. Most of the spells are invented, but some of them have a basis in what people used to believe worked. We owe a lot of our scientific knowledge to the alchemists!" (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/feature/6230/002-8948111-7250419) 

Crowley said it didn't really matter anyway. As long as the witch has something to blank out the mind and blaspheme against God's power, it is enough to attract the devils! 

CONCLUSION 

These are just a sample of the problems with these Potter books. In the 20th century, it became fashionable to present "real life characters" in literature. This meant that children who knew to stay away from bars and brothels, had to meet these same types of people in their school books! However, they are not only "in" the books, they are the characters that the authors want their readers to "identify" with. Rowling is no different. She claims she just "writes" and that she has no particular audience in mind. She claims she has no moral agenda. However, it is absurd to look at literature in this manner. Adults are responsible before God for what they write to children, whether it be fiction or non-fiction. If fiction did was not able to INFLUENCE people, the Lord Jesus would have never spoke in PARABLES. Miss Rowling, and all who recommend her books to children need to hear the words of Jesus: 

Matthew 18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 

These words, Miss Rowling, are not FICTION.

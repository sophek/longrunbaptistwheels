THE CORNERSTONE OF ANGLO-SAXON CIVILIZATION: EVERYDAY SAYINGS DERIVED FROM THE KJV
************************************************************************
"Have you ever been at wit's end? Fallen flat on your face? Met a person with a holier-than-thou attitude? Engaged in a labor of love? Told someone to rise and shine? Or to eat, drink and be merry? If so, whether you knew it or not, you were borrowing figuratively from the King James Bible. A professor in Australia scholar who has spent 10 years re-editing the King James has compiled a list of phrases that the English language owes to that venerable volume. We reprint the list, courtesy of The Chronicle of Higher Education."

(DallasNews.com, Religion Sneak Peek: August 5, 2005)

Comments: The KJV does not need re-editing. However, it is good to hear this testimony of the influence this Bible has had on our language. However, a better testimony was given in the Dallas Morning News, in 1941:

"The King James Bible is the cornerstone of Anglo-Saxon  civilization....Our economic systems, our literary and cultural pursuits are rooted in this single fructifying source."

LET HER ALONE: ARE CHRISTIAN WOMEN FORBIDDEN TO WRITE BOOKS?
************************************************************************

Pharisees forbid what God does not forbid (Matthew 15:3), while they permit what God does not permit (Matthew 15:4-6). As Christians, we must study and pray so that we do not get things upside down in this manner.

Recently, I have heard it implied that a woman who writes a book is breaking the Scripture in 1 Timothy 2:12:

1 Timothy 2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

Yet, this same brother believes it is proper for women to ask questions (in an orderly manner), and give their testimonies IN THE CHURCH.

In other words, the command to be "in silence" is wrongly applied to writing books, while at the same time it is NOT applied to SPEAKING in the church (the very reason it is given in the Bible).

The claim is made by some that it only refers to "preaching" from the pulpit. We are told that the command to the Corinthian women against even asking questions, only refers to "disorderly" questions. Do we not see that the "Christian" homosexuals, in the same manner, teach that Paul is only forbidding a "promiscuous abuse" of homosexuality? In fact, there is no end to the modern use of this fallacious interpretive device. I believe this method of interpretation forbids what God allows, and permits what God forbids.

The true interpretation of these Scriptures concerning women is to take them exactly as they are written, while simply applying the qualifications found in the context:

1 Corinthians 14:18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
19 YET IN THE CHURCH I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.

I begin with this phrase "yet in the church," in verse 19, since it immediately shows us that what is sometimes permissible outside the church, is not proper inside the assembly:

1 Corinthians 14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep SILENCE in THE CHURCH; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

This man does not have to keep silence outside the church. He only has to keep silent (if there be no interpreter) IN the church. What does "in the church" mean? It is defined in previous verses by the phrase "when ye come together" (14:26, 11:17,20).

This brings us to the Biblical command concerning women:

1 Corinthians 14:34 Let your women keep silence IN THE CHURCHES: for it is not permitted unto them to SPEAK; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.

35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ASK their husbands AT HOME: for it is a shame for women to speak IN THE CHURCH.

The word "silence" is explained by "speaking." Women are not permitted to speak. They can't even ask questions (their modesty, orderliness, etc. does not grant them liberty to ignore the precept). However, they ARE permitted to speak (ask questions, etc.), AT HOME (v.35). Why? It is because HOME is not "in the church." The whole church is not together (mixed assembly).

Therefore, the dear brother who allows women to ask questions and testify in a regular, mixed-assembly church service, yet forbids them to write books, has things backwards!

The command in 1 Timothy 2 is guided by this clear teaching in 1 Corinthians 14:

1 Timothy 2:11 Let the woman LEARN IN SILENCE with all subjection.
12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be IN SILENCE.

We are told that this command to learn in "silence" forbids writing books (since that would be "teaching"), yet the command supposedly ALLOWS testimonies and orderly questions. However, the command here in 1 Timothy 2 is, again, referring to the conduct of women IN THE CHURCH:

1 Timothy 3:14 THESE THINGS I WRITE unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
15 But if I tarry long, THAT thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, WHICH IS THE CHURCH of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

Paul wrote the command in 1 Timothy 2:11-12 so Timothy would know how to conduct the affairs IN THE CHURCH. Women are to be silent in the mixed-assembly church service. They are forbidden to speak or to even ask questions.

Yet, outside the regular mixed-assembly church service, women may freely speak. Certainly, they should submit to their husbands outside of church, as well as inside it. And the Bible teaches that women should not be sinfully, rebelliously LOUD:

Proverbs 7:11 (She is LOUD and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

Proverbs 9:13 A foolish woman is CLAMOROUS: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.

Proverbs 27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

They are to have a meek and quiet spirit (1 Peter 3:4). They are to be shame-faced (not impudent-faced). Yet, these Scriptures do not forbid speaking, or even instructing others outside the church. They refer to the godly, feminine manner in which such things should be done.

What is happening today is that these Scriptures on how women are to act and behave at all times (such as outside the church), are being used to describe how women should testify or speak INSIDE the church. But this is a great error. Inside the mixed-church meeting, women are to be silent (as a picture of Christ's humble submission to the Father, and man's call to submit to Christ). Outside the mixed church meeting, women are permitted to speak, ask questions, testify, witness, etc. The attempt to separate testifying, witnessing, etc., from general "teaching" brings great confusion, since there is no clear line of separation. Women are told by some that they CAN tell someone about Jesus, but they are not allowed to write books and tell someone about Jesus! They are told that they can testify, exhort, admonish, and encourage from the pulpit, but they must not get "preachy." Some women can preach better than the preacher in a "testimony." Poor women! This reminds me of the tim!

 e I saw a black church let a woman preach a sermon, as long as she didn't stand a few feet back, in the pulpit. This was not technically at "church," but it does show the confusion that exists. It also reminds me of the time, years ago, when the city wanted to charge us a large fee for having a small "stage" in the church (pulpit area). After much contention, another official told us that if we simply called it a "platform" there would be no fee! I believe that much of this confusion arises from trying to permit what God forbids, and from forbidding what God permits.

I remember a few years ago when they first invented "chat rooms." I have not used these for many years, but there was a time when I tried them as a means to teach, edify, etc. There was one man that used to visit various, fundamental chat rooms, and whenever a woman did not agree with him, he would command her "to be silent," on the basis of 1 Corinthians 14, etc. He was applying this command to typing letters on a keyboard in a chat room! It seems that many like to keep this command very vague; this way they can use it whenever they want to discipline a Christian woman and keep her "in line."

I do not believe in women pastors. How can a woman be a pastor if she cannot speak in the mixed church assembly? Plus, she would wrongly be in an office of authority over men. I do not believe in women deacons (a deacon is an office).

But perhaps we should take some time to notice what women CAN do. Many have noticed that WISDOM is likened unto a VIRTUOUS WOMAN in the Book of Proverbs (31:10, 3:15, 8:11). It might be argued that whatever we see Mrs. Wisdom doing, virtuous women are also permitted to do:

Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words...

Proverbs 8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

Proverbs 9:3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

Proverbs 31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.

Such a woman, crying out on the streets (not in the mixed church assembly), brought the late, great radio preacher M.R. DeHaan (1891-1965), to the Lord. The Samaritan woman brought many to Christ (outside the church):

John 4:28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way INTO THE CITY, and saith TO THE MEN,
29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the SAYING OF THE WOMAN, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

This was public testifying outside the church. And this repentant woman was used by God to bring many to Christ!

In the same manner, the women at the tomb, went and testified to the disciples:

Luke 24:9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.

11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

They did not testify in church.

There is no record of the daughters of Philip prophesying inside the mixed church assembly (Acts 21:8-9). There is no record of any women doing so in the early church (except for perhaps the evil woman whom Jesus called Jezebel in Revelation 2:20).

Priscilla taught Apollos (along with her husband). But she did not speak in a mixed church assembly:

Acts 18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, THEY took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

Manoah's wife opened up her mouth with wisdom, and encouraged him in the Lord. But she was not speaking in a New Testament mixed church assembly:

Judges 13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
23 But HIS WIFE SAID UNTO HIM, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.

The wise woman in 2 Samuel 20 CRIED unto Joab with great wisdom. She spoke to all her people in her wisdom, and saved her city from destruction. But she was not speaking in a New Testament mixed church assembly:

2 Samuel 20:16 Then CRIED A WISE WOMAN out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

22 Then the woman WENT UNTO ALL THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM. And they cut off the head of Sheba...

Abigail reasoned with David, and opened her mouth with wisdom. But she was not speaking in a New Testament mixed church assembly:

1 Samuel 25:23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,

24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and HEAR THE WORDS Of THINE HANDMAID.

Mary rightly advised the attendants at the wedding in Cana. But she was not speaking in a New Testament mixed church assembly:

John 2:4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
5 His mother SAITH UNTO THE SERVANTS, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

We see many women in the Bible greatly used of the Lord (Deborah, Esther, etc.). None of these are examples of women speaking in a mixed church assembly. Yet, all of these Scriptures, together, provide us with abundant proof that there is no prohibition against a godly woman, in submission to her husband (if she is married), writing a Christian book to encourage, edify, teach, etc.

It is true, that the endeavor must not take her away from her home responsibilities (if she has a husband and children). And I do not think it is expedient for women to ignore the Scriptures on modest dress, glorious hair, being keepers at home, being silent in the church, etc., and then get involved in teaching others on doctrinal or prophetic subjects. I do not think it is proper for a woman to disobey her husband, and disobey her pastor, and teach divisive things, simply because she feels she has the gift of teaching. I think aged women are called to teach younger women the things listed in Titus 2.

On the other hand, a woman who is in submission to her husband, and has the blessing of a godly pastor and church, is obviously at liberty to write Christian books. Such Christian books do not usurp the authority of men, since husbands can decide whether their families will read them, and pastors (i.e. men) can decide whether or not to recommend them, etc. 

In conclusion, we should remember that zealous men once rebuked a woman for pouring costly oil on the head of the Lord (Matthew 26:8). And they were then rebuked by Jesus! At another time, mothers brought infants to Jesus, and were rebuked by the Lord's zealous male disciples. Again, they were then rebuked by the Lord. Perhaps those who would rebuke a godly lady for writing a godly book, would also be told by the Lord: "Let her alone..." (John 12:7)

******************************************
RESPONSE TO TED BAEHR'S "MOVIEGUIDE"
*******************************************

My words below are strong. But please know they are meant in love for what is happening today in our churches.

In a recent article in WND (Aug. 12, 2005), Ted Baehr asks the question, "Is the church being corrupted?" The very existence of such a question, in the face of the fact that so many "conservative" Christians are "R-rated movie junkies," answers itself! Baehr writes:

"Almost every day recently, someone e-mails us about a study done by MarketCast supposedly showing that conservative, red state, fundamentalist Christians go to more violent, R-rated films than do liberals. Our wonderful editor, Dr. Tom Snyder, asked what movies they used in the study, expecting to hear 'The Passion,' 'Amistad,' 'Dead Man Walking,' and other movies with redemptive violence, but instead found that they were talking about movies like 'Kill Bill' and 'American Pie,' which are abhorrent." (WND)

"Redemptive violence"? I guess this is the new phrase to hide the BLOODLUST of the "new Christianity." I guess we just didn't "understand" the Roman Circus. It was "art." (Remember, they didn't just watch lions eat Christians. They dressed them up like characters, and had them unwillingly play parts in theater! This was ancient REALITY TV). Notice, that it has been documented that more MODERN CHRISTIANS are addicted to the sicko, perverted violence in R-rated films than the unbelievers. I have been continuously warning about this depravity for many years. It is supposedly seen as "manly" to watch blood splatter on the screen, and eat popcorn as we "enjoy" seeing people scream and suffer. And these movies are not just filled with sinful violence, they are also usually filled with nudity and profanity.

I have also been reproving Christians who see it as their "ministry" to watch every wretched, defiled movie that Hollywood puts out, so they can "warn" or "help" the saints make "wise choices." These people ALWAYS end up downplaying FILTH, and adding, "You might not want to bring little children to view these ADULT themes." This teaches people that it is OKAY for "adults" to watch perversion.

The amazing thing in all of this is Baehr's next statement:
 
"The nature of this study can be interpreted in various ways, so it may not be as dark and gloomy as it appears."

This is relative, subjective doublespeak if you have ever heard it! Baehr then states:

"Therefore, even if it's not as bad as it seems, it underlines a very serious problem, the drum that we have been beating for a long time: Christians need to be involved in culture - shaping, changing, redeeming and reforming the culture."

Bible verse? Proof-text? We can show some verses on the need for Christians to RESTRAIN culture, and HINDER through the Holy Spirit, the Antichrist and his spirit. But how can Christians hinder evil, convict and reprove the world of sin, when they are the FIRST ONES TO DIVE INTO THE SLIME-PIT? Christianity had more of a restraining influence upon the evils of theater, when saints had nothing at all to do with it! And this is a fact. We have had decades of people like Baehr encouraging Christians to JUMP INTO THE FIRE. And as the fire burns hotter, we are told, "SEE, WE NEED MORE CHRISTIANS TO JUMP INTO THE FURNACE!" This reminds me of the welfare argument by the Left Elite. The more they VICTIMIZE certain groups, the weaker and more dependent these groups become.

Baehr thinks that the situation at least calls for a Biblical warning. Yet, he misses the most important warning!:

"Not everybody is going to be negatively influenced by some of these abhorrent movies, but the Bible says not to even give an appearance of evil."

He is correct in saying that Christians should stay away from evil movies for the sake of their testimony. However, he boldly contradicts the Holy Ghost in the above statement. And he fails to give the NEEDED WARNING that the Bible provides. If there was any time to give it, it would be now, when the world is LAUGHING at the bloodlust of Christians. Yet, this warning is not given. Instead, it is implied that the warning is wrong, and that we are wiser than God! No, everyone will not necessarily become an axe murderer for watching a movie that glorifies such murder as entertainment. However, EVERYONE will be "negatively influenced." This is why the more evil movies that these Christian people at MOVIEGUIDE continue to watch, THE LESS QUALIFIED they will be to instruct Christians about them. The more they view, the more deluded they become. They become calloused and hardened. They begin to tolerate more and more evil. Soon, they are no longer blushing at abominations. THIS is !

 what the Bible teaches:

1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

But they are deceived. They think they can view nudity and carnality and profanity, and they will continue to have a GODLY HATRED of these things:

2 Corinthians 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,

Proverbs 22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

Yet, many are having fellowship with FURIOUS men, in ungodly, violent movies:

Proverbs 23:31 LOOK NOT thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.

Proverbs 23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

2 Timothy 3:5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such TURN AWAY.

Psalms 101:3 I will set NO wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.

These are just a few of scores of Bible verses that could be cited. They show that many modern Christians are wrong about the nature of evil. They have replaced God's wisdom with modern psychological ideas, and pragmatic rationalizations to justify their unholy addictions.

Sadly, Baehr ends his article with the following words:

"This shocking study confirms what we've already known for years and re-emphasizes the need for MOVIEGUIDEÃ‚Â® and 'The Media-Wise Family.' We are here to help you and the church. Please let us do just that."

Let's get this straight! This study - that shows that modern Christians are more addicted to bloody, gory, sleazy movies than non-Christians - actually shows Christians why they need MOVIEGUIDE? No! It shows modern Christians why they need to SEPARATE from HELLISH HOLLYWOOD, altogether. The folks at MOVIEGUIDE do not have true Biblical standards. I do not doubt that they are sincere, and they are only trying to help. Yet, they approve movies that no God-fearing Christians should be viewing.

What is occurring is that many sows, who would like to return to wallowing in the mire, are finding that they can simply FANATICIZE about the mud by going to the movies. They think this will be acceptable to God. But God teaches us not to make provision for the flesh. And that FEEDING the lusts of the heart will soon cause these lusts to conceive into sin (James 1:15):

Hebrews 11:15 And truly, if they had been MINDFUL of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

Luke 9:62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and LOOKING BACK, is fit for the kingdom of God.

Lot's wife did not turn and run back to Sodom. She only LOOKED back. This desire to live a pretend life of rank sin through the "unholy stars" on the screen is abominable before God. And the state of modern Christianity proves that multitudes are not just stopping at the unholy fantasy. True to Scripture, their manners and lifestyles are being corrupted, and they are LIVING what they are learning on the screen:

Proverbs 13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.

Psalms 106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

STAGE-SETTING FOR REBUILT TEMPLE
****************************************

"Arabs, Israelis prepare Temple Mount showdown - Jewish, Muslim groups plan major protests at same time on explosive holy site next week - JERUSALEM - A Palestinian Temple Mount leader with alleged links to Hamas has called on Arabs to flood the holy site next weekend to protect it from 'Israeli protesters,' while a Jewish group is urging Jews to ascend the Mount en mass the same day....Sheikh Raed Salah, head of the Islamic Movement, a Palestinian Temple Mount activist group, called on Arabs Friday to 'defend the Al-Aqsa Mosque' Aug. 14, the day Jews commemorate the destruction of the First and Second Temples with a 25-hour fast..."

(WND, Aug.6, 2005)

COMMENTS: The desire to rebuild the temple will be realized in the Tribulation Period (if not before). Scriptures such as Matthew 24:15, Revelation 11:1 and 2 Thessalonians 2:4 will have a literal, future fulfillment, just as the prophecies related to Christ's first coming had a literal, grammatical fulfillment. The spiritualizers had "the appearance of things" on their side, in the 19th century. Even so, men such as Govett, Peters, Pember, Fry, John Wilkinson, etc., walked by faith, instead of sight. They predicted (from the Scriptures) that Israel would be restored to the land as a nation "in unbelief," and that the literal temple would be rebuilt, to be desecrated by the Antichrist. With so much already in place, and the stage being rapidly set all around us, the very existence of spiritualizers, in this day, baffles the mind!

INFAMOUS SINAITICUS SOON ONLINE
***************************************

"Oldest known Bible to go online - A manuscript containing the oldest known Biblical New Testament in the world is set to enter the digital age and become accessible online.

A team of experts from the UK, Europe, Egypt and Russia is currently digitising the parchment known as the Codex Sinaiticus, believed originally to have been one of 50 copies of the scriptures commissioned by Roman Emperor Constantine after he converted to Christianity. The Bible, which is currently in the British Library in London, dates from the 4th Century....The original document is so precious that it has only been seen by four scholars in the last 20 years. The Codex Sinaiticus contains the whole of the Christian Bible; specifically, it has the oldest complete copy of the New Testament, as well as the Greek Old Testament, known as the Septuagint, which includes books now regarded as apocrypha. It is named after the place it was written, the monastery of Saint Catherine in Sinai, Egypt, set beneath the mountain where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments. It remained there until the middle of the 19th Century when a visiting German scholar, Constantin von !

 Tischendorf, took parts of it away to Germany and Russia. To this day, the monastery officially regards it as stolen. In total the codex is now in four portions, the largest of which - 347 of the 400 pages - is that at the British Library. The rest are split between Leipzig University Library, the National Library of Russia in St Petersburg, and the monastery. - Free website - All four institutions are co-operating to digitise the entire text, as well as using hyperspectral imaging to photograph it, in order to find any hidden or erased text. 'To do it also in infra-red or ultra-violet photography, as in forensics, you'll find out any hidden aspects of it as well,' explained the British Library's digitisation expert Lawrence Pordez...."

(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4739369.stm ; Aug. 3, 2005)

COMMENTS: This manuscript contains readings that are corrupt (along with corrupt books that should not be in the Bible canon). The manuscript had been discarded by Bible believing Christians. It (along with Vaticanus) is the manuscript that is used by the Greek texts the new versions rely upon. I have said before, that this new technology of "hyperspectral imaging" will have many surprises in store for us, and will soon open up a world of controversy. Will they find the readings of the King James Bible behind the text?

*******************************
DAVID'S PALACE FOUND?
*******************************
"King David's fabled palace: Is this it? - JERUSALEM - An Israeli archeologist says she has uncovered in east Jerusalem what she believes may be the fabled palace of the biblical King David. Her work has been sponsored by the Shalem Center, a neoconservative think tank in Jerusalem, and funded by a American Jewish investment banker who would like to help provide scientific support for the Bible as a reflection of Jewish history. Other scholars who have toured the site are skeptical that the foundation walls Eilat Mazar has discovered are David's palace. But they acknowledge that what she has uncovered is rare and important - a major public building from around the 10th century BC with pottery shards that date from the time of David and Solomon and a government seal of an official mentioned in the book of Jeremiah. For nearly 10 years, Mazar thought she knew where the fabled palace built for King David, as described in the Bible, might be - just outside the walls of the ancie!

 nt city of Jerusalem. Now she thinks she's found it, and if she's right, her discovery will be a new salvo in a major dispute in biblical archaeology - whether or not the kingdom of David and Samuel was of historical importance...."

COMMENTS: The infidels and Scripture scoffers will not be persuaded though a fellow critic rises from Hell to reason with them. I do hope that this archeologist is able to prove that David and Solomon's kingdoms were as the Bible teaches. It is reasonable to expect that she will be able to do so. But the Bible has already been proven to be correct so many times, in the face of scoffers, that one more time will matter little to these blind guides. They once doubted Belshazzar (Daniel 5). They do not doubt him any longer. Then they pretended that the Hittite Kingdom (in the Bible) was only mythological. Today, you can take an online course on the Hittite language! God is right. The Bible is right. And when the views of Bible mockers and scoffers are long dead and disproven, with their fuzzy, figurative, higher criticism - the views of literal Bible believers (despised by the "educated" world), will still be standing, and shining in glory!

WHAT'S NEW AT KINGDOM BAPTIST?
******************************************
We had a blessed Lord's Day this past weekend with visiting Pastor Geurrero. He preached on the danger of experiencing the terror of the Lord if we do not persuade men (i.e. go soul winning). Brother Lewis Pritchard was baptized the former Sunday.

        <h1>THE COMMON MAN'S DEFENSE OF KJV ONLYISM</h1>
        <div id="content">
            INTRODUCTION

The objections of the many scholars, pastors and Christian leaders who oppose KJV Onlyism often have more in common with "political doublespeak" than rational argumentation. Therefore, the goal of this first book is to simply expose these objections for what they are. To understand the real difference between KJV Onlyism and the view of those who oppose it, we do not need knowledge of the original languages or classes in textual criticism. We simply need to compare the KJV with what these scholars call their written Word of God. Any Christian who may be intimidated or confused by this latest assault on the KJV, will at once be relieved when the smokescreen is cleared away, and these scholars are called to present and defend their preserved "bible."

This book presents the basic, foundational proofs of KJV Onlyism that may be immediately observed by anyone truly seeking the brightest revelation of God in these last days. (The next book in this series will examine the internal, miraculous proofs that reveal that the KJV is the perfect, preserved Word of God.)

        <h1>THE MEANING OF THE WORD "BAPTISM"</h1>
        <div id="content">
            The word "baptize" has been transferred into our English Bible from the Greek copies. Baptists have historically argued the fact that the word, in its primary meaning, means "to dip." Many lexicons and English dictionaries make this fact clear. However, some dictionaries (even some of the better ones) have refused to enter into religious controversy. Therefore, instead of actually defining the word "baptize," they simply state how the word has come to be used in the various branches of Christendom. It is good that these dictionaries reveal how many commonly use the word. Yet, they should do this only after strictly defining the word. If we allow theological, Bible words to be defined by the religious climate, it will not be long before "God" will be defined as "she"! (In fact, I recently read of some liberal, rebellious Baptists doing this very thing at a recent conference.)

First, we can glean the fact that "baptize" means to "dip" by simply noticing the context of its usage in Scripture:
<blockquote>John 3:23 And John also was BAPTIZING in Aenon near to Salim, because there was MUCH WATER there: and they came, and were baptized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Acts 8:38 ....they went DOWN both INTO THE WATER, both Philip and the eunuch; and he BAPTIZED him. 39 And when they were come UP OUT OF THE WATER...</blockquote>
We do not need "much water" to sprinkle. And there would be no need for BOTH parties to go "down" into the water and get all wet if "baptism" is by sprinkling. Why not just fill up a cup?

Secondly, baptism is said to include the idea of a BURIAL with Christ (Rom.6:4, Col.2:12). How can this precious truth be associated with "sprinkling"? Govett writes:
<blockquote>"Baptism is the burial that follows on death...Baptism, according to the mind of God, must be immersion. For in it there are both burial and resurrection. In pouring on the face, or sprinkling, there is neither burial nor resurrection." (Robert Govett, "Govett on Colossians," 1890; pp.115, 118)</blockquote>
Notice the word "baptize" as defined by various dictionaries, historians and scholars:
<blockquote>"Gr. baptizein, to dip under water."
(Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary; 1956)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"...the Greek word, whence comes 'baptize,' signifies immerse..." (Robert Govett, "Govett on Colossians," p.123)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"In respect to the form of baptism, it was in conformity with the original institution, and the original import of the symbol, performed by immersion..." (Neander, "History," Vol. I)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"...baptism was administered in convenient places...by immersing the candidate wholly in water." (Mosheim, "Ecc. Hist.")</blockquote>
<blockquote>"To dip repeatedly, dip under, middle voice, to bathe; hence to steep, wet, to pour upon, drench..." (Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon; 1843)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Baptize" can mean "pour upon"; yet only when a person has been drenched to such a degree that he can be said to have been completely COVERED. For example, in a storm, a wave of the ocean can "pour" down upon a ship and "baptize" it (Mat.8:24).</blockquote>
The next quote is very interesting:
<blockquote>"...the Baptists are, from the Protestant standpoint, unassailable, since for their demand of baptism by submersion they have the clear Bible text." (J. Dollinger - cited in "Baptist Principles Reset," Jeter).</blockquote>
Dollinger was a popular, 19th century Roman Catholic scholar. He could freely argue the truth of the Baptist position since he also erroneously argued that the R.C.C. has the "authority" to change or add to the Bible through its tradition! Nevertheless, we appreciate his "confession" in regard to the Biblical truth of the Baptist position.

It is therefore clear (even to our Roman Catholic opponents) that the primary meaning of the word "baptize" means to "dip." Yet, have we ever thought about what the word "dip" fully means? Webster's 1828 defines "dip" as:
<blockquote>"1. To plunge or immerse, for a MOMENT OR SHORT TIME, in water or other liquid substance; to put into a fluid and WITHDRAW."</blockquote>
Therefore, "dipping" includes the idea of "withdrawing again." The Oxford Dictionary agrees. It defines "dip" as:
<blockquote>"1. To put down or let down TEMPORARILY..."</blockquote>
John Clark (known by many as the father of American Baptists), in 1652, notes that the idea of "raising again" is indeed a large part of the definition of the word "baptism":
<blockquote>"In that the word [baptize] by which it is so frequently expressed, doth in proper English signify to dip, to plunge under water, and as it were to drown, but yet so as with SAFETY, so that the party (as to the manner) may be drowned again, and again, see the instance of Naaman...[2 Kings 5:14]." ("Ill-Newes From New England," London; 1652)</blockquote>
Indeed, if we define the word "baptize" directly from its usage in Scripture, we must of necessity include the idea of "resurrection," since everyone who was immersed was brought to the surface again:
<blockquote>Mark 1:10 And straightway COMING UP OUT OF THE WATER, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Acts 8:39 And when they were COME UP OUT OF THE WATER...</blockquote>
Paul therefore includes the idea of resurrection in his concept of baptism, as assuredly as he does death and burial:
<blockquote>Romans 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by BAPTISM into death: that like as Christ was RAISED UP from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Col. 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, WHEREIN ALSO ye are RISEN with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</blockquote>
The word "wherein" reveals that the idea of "baptism" includes a resurrection or a raising. The word "dip" itself is never used in Scripture in any other way but to specify a submerging with a subsequent rising again. Therefore, the technical definition of "baptism" is not just "immersion," but TEMPORARY immersion (or covering). The single, best definition is to "dip," since it, in itself, is only a temporary immersion.

Every Bible verse that utilizes the word "baptize" (or one of its forms) reveals an immersion or covering with a subsequent raising. We therefore have no warrant to depart from this definition in regard to those Scriptures that use the word with something other than water. Notice these scriptures:
<blockquote>1 Cor. 10:2 And were all BAPTIZED unto Moses IN the cloud and IN the sea;</blockquote>
The immersions into the "cloud" and "sea" (Ps.78:13) were only temporary. The cloud temporarily "covered":
<blockquote>Ps 105:39 He spread a cloud for a COVERING; and fire to give light in the night.</blockquote>
The next verse reveals a baptism into suffering:
<blockquote>Mat. 20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.</blockquote>
The immersion of our Lord into suffering, death and burial was only temporary. It was a total "dipping," and not a "sprinkling." Nevertheless, it was accompanied by a subsequent raising. This is why it could correctly be called a "baptism."

There is also a baptism with fire:
<blockquote>Mt 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall BAPTIZE you with the Holy Ghost, and with FIRE:</blockquote>
The Lord shall try all men with fire at His coming. Unbelievers will be slain by fire at the Lord's appearing (2 Thess.1:8). All the men who have experienced (or will experience) the fires of Hell will all COME OUT to stand at the Great White Throne (Rev.20:5, 13-15). Unbelievers will at that time be cast forever into the Lake of Fire. Therefore, there is indeed a "temporary" immersion in fire (before the final judgment day after the Millennium). Yet, this in no way argues against the truth of endless punishment in the final Lake of Fire on the Last Day.

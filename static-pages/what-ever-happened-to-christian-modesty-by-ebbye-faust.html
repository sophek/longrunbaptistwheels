What ever happened to Christian modesty? This is a question I fear that not many women ask themselves. Who cares about such things like that anyway? Aren't we under the liberty of Christ? It is a shame that Christian modesty has become a "non issue" for most women. If the world decides on a new fashion, for some reason Christian ladies follow along. Women today are so "timid" that they feel they need to follow a leader. If the leader decides that she wants to expose her knee and show her thigh, then they do also. If their leader decides that it is best to dress as seductively as possible, then so will the Christian women. Women of God, what are we doing? The world is lost in the darkness and we are to be its light! The world isn't here to show us how to live and dress and act, but we are here to save those in the world by preaching the Gospel of Christ! Why are we so caught up with the fashions and fads of this world when there are millions of people dying every day without the knowledge of Christ? I'm sorry dear sinner, I know you will die soon, but before you go, will you please impart to me your knowledge of fashion? Will you show me just one more trick so that I may be admired by men? How ridiculous that sounds to our ears, but not to our eyes! The world has taught you well.

Pastor's wives all around the country are wearing mini skirts that expose their knees (legs are one of the most sexy parts of the body to a man's eyes) and low cut dresses to church. What do you think that the other women in the churches look like? They remain without a godly example to learn by. Though your intentions may be pure, and you meant no harm, the Christian brother for whom Christ died can't even look at the praise and worship leader as he leads in song because you are in the way in your tight and seductive clothing.

Let me ask you a question: if you were alone with a wicked man, which parts of your body would you wish to be covered? Do you think that a low cut dress or short skirt would be acceptable then? What if your clothes were tight and revealing? Surely you would then desire to be as modest as possible. You are in the presence of wicked men daily, and in the presence of struggling Christian brothers. Is the Lord pleased with our way of dressing? Please ask yourself that question the next time you leave the doors of your own home. You too will have to "stand before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." 2 Cor. 5:10 Are you loving your brother as your self? Are you pleasing the Lord that died for you by your modesty? Please remember Paul's admonition in 1 Cor. 8:13: 1 Corinthians 8:13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

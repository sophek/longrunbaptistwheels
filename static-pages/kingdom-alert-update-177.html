DOES GOD LOVE EVERY PERSON?

Does God love every person in the world? This subject, believe it or not, is often debated among fundamentalists. The reason is that there are two seemingly opposing sets of Scriptures. As is usually the case in such circumstances, the answer to the question is therefore "yes" AND "no." Instead of jumping to one side and then trying to "argue out" of the Scriptures on the other side, we should simply notice that there is more than one definition or usage of the word "love" in Scripture (as in the English language in general). Therefore, God hates proud sinners. Yet, He also loves them.

Notice, it is clear that God hates open sinners. To deny this fact is to close our eyes to multitudes of Scriptures.

Psalms 11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul HATETH.

Psalms 5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou HATEST all workers of iniquity.

Psalms 10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD ABHORRETH.

Proverbs 6:16 These six things doth the LORD HATE: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
19 A false WITNESS that speaketh lies, and HE that soweth discord among brethren.

Leviticus 20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I ABHORRED THEM.

Psalms 78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:

It is equally clear that God loves sinners:

John 3:16 For God so LOVED the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Romans 5:8 But God COMMENDETH his LOVE toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Titus 3:4 But after that the kindness and LOVE of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

1 John 4:9 In this was manifested the LOVE of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

Luke 6:32 For if ye LOVE them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.
35 But LOVE ye your ENEMIES, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be THE CHILDREN OF THE HIGHEST: FOR he IS KIND unto the unthankful and to the evil.
36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also IS merciful.

2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, NOT WILLING that ANY should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

God does not have good feelings of delight, pleasure and approval in His soul when He beholds proud sinners (saved or unsaved). He only delights in obedience:

Hebrews 10:38 ....if any man draw back, my SOUL shall have no pleasure in him.

Psalms 11:5 ...the wicked and him that loveth violence his SOUL HATETH.

However, God does "love" all sinners in the sense that He gave His Son for the whole world (1 John 2:2), desires all to come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9), and daily shows kindness, benevolence, patience and mercy to His enemies (Matthew 5:44-45). Finney (1792-1875) writes:

"God loves all men with the love of benevolence, but He does not feel the love of complacency toward any but those who live holy. Christians love each other with the love of complacency [pleasure, satisfaction, gratification], only in proportion to their holiness. If Christian love is the love of the image of Christ in His people, then it can be exercised only where that image really or apparently exists. A person must reflect the image of Christ, and show the spirit of Christ before other Christians can love him with the love of complacency. It is in vain to call on Christians to love one another with the love of complacency, as Christians, when they are sunk down in stupidity. They see nothing in each other to produce this love. It is next to impossible that they should feel otherwise toward each other than they do toward sinners." ("Revival Lectures")

Webster understands these differing aspects of love when he writes:

"...the Christian loves God with the love of complacency in his attributes, the love of benevolence towards the interest of his kingdom, and the love of gratitude for favors received." (Webster's 1828 Dictionary, "Love")

Let us hold fast the form of sound words in this shallow age.

SHOULD WE ALWAYS WITNESS SOFTLY?: MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF SINNER

One of the greatest delusions of this modern age is that "love" means that sin is to be ignored, lies are to tolerated, and sinners are to be unconditionally accepted in all situations, at all times. This is the "love" that is preached by Hollywood. First of all, notice what the Bible says concerning "love":

Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your LOVE may abound yet more and more in KNOWLEDGE and in all JUDGMENT;
10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ...

People often object to street preaching by calling attention to the fact that Jesus was gentle and nice toward sinners. Yet, they fail to notice that these sinners were already BROKEN. Their hearts were open to God. They knew that they were sinners and they needed to hear the good news of mercy and truth. They had not rejected the strong preparatory preaching of John the Baptist:

Matthew 21:32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the PUBLICANS AND THE HARLOTS BELIEVED HIM...

Certainly, Jesus would not upbraid these tender hearts that were already open to Him:

Isaiah 42:3 A bruised reed shall he not break...

However, when Jesus went street preaching to whole cities that had rejected light, His manner was entirely different:

Matthew 11:20 Then began he to UPBRAID the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

And notice how Jesus dealt with the proud Pharisees:

Matthew 12:34 O generation of VIPERS, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

Matthew 23:33 Ye SERPENTS, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?

Jesus did not break a bruised reed. Yet, it is also clear that Jesus did not quench a rebellious, smoking flax by pampering it with smooth words. He upbraided whole cities. He obeyed the following Proverb:

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.

Sinners must know that they have sinned. And they need to know the penalties for sin. Many people, especially in America, are hardened to the Gospel. They do not need soothing words. They need to agree with God concerning the nature of sin and its penalty. And many Christians have become hardened to their own warnings in the same manner that unbelievers have become hardened to their own. We therefore need more street preachers to contend with the wicked.

It is true that Christians must be guided by reason and the Holy Spirit when discerning what method of preaching to apply to individual sinners (saved or unsaved). But this is exactly the way the Bible commands us to witness! We are not called to witness only ONE way. This is the what the fluffy, emotional spirit (that has neutralized much of Christendom) obviously believes. No, we are called to discern WHO we are dealing with, and apply the APPROPRIATE degree of severity:

Titus 1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them SHARPLY, that they may be sound in the faith...

Jude 1:22 And OF SOME have compassion, making a difference:
23 And OTHERS save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

The spirit of the world (that has largely entered the churches) does not understand Jude 1:22. It pretends that it reads "of ALL have compassion." This is because the Devil has taught Christians that it is "legalistic and mean" to NAME sins and preach that God HATES them. Thus we see that Christianity is largely neutralized in its power. It is through the foolishness of PREACHING that God chooses to work (1 Corinthians 1:21, 2 Timothy 4:2). And the majority of preaching (whether in the pulpit or on the street) is overly soft and anemic today. May the Lord help us to repent of this and be bold to preach His truth. And may we equally be sure to use compassion and gentleness where it is proper to do so.

TELEVISION: WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN UNSAVED "STARS" HAVE GREATER STANDARDS THAN MANY MODERN FUNDAMENTALISTS?

In 1946, there were only 7000 television sets in America. In 1949, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported:

"Television's combination of moving pictures, sound and immediacy produces an IMPACT that extends television as an advertising medium into the realm of PERSONAL sales solicitation."

Satan, knowing the truth of this report, was quick to take advantage of the new medium. Yet, in 1952, many were momentarily awakened to the spiritual dangers of television. Their protests moved a House subcommittee to "investigate" the immorality and offensive influence of television. Nevertheless, in this same year, there were already over 15 million television sets in the homes of Americans. In 1987, 50% of homes would also be wired for cable. A year later, 60% would have a VCR. By 1993, 98% of the homes in the U.S. would possess a television! 64% would have at least two televisions. Satan has therefore successfully compromised a majority of the churches in America through worldly television and movies. These mediums have brought nothing but temptation, destruction and ruin:

1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

Ironically, there are quite a few worldly "stars" who have enough light to at least know that television leads to the corruption of morals and the dulling of the intellect and conscience. This is sad. God does not like it when His own people, who name the name of Christ, have standards below the average non-Christian. He has called us to a standard of living far higher than the average sinner:

2 Timothy 2:19 ....Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

Matthew 5:46 ....what reward have ye? do not even the PUBLICANS the same?

Luke 6:32 ....what thank have ye? for SINNERS also love those that love them.

1 Corinthians 3:3 ....are ye not carnal, and walk AS MEN?

The Lord is especially displeased when His people live BELOW the standards of the average lost person. This brings reproach and blasphemy upon His Holy Word:

1 Timothy 6:1 ....that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.

Titus 2:5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that THE WORD OF GOD BE NOT BLASPHEMED.

1 Timothy 5:14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, GIVE NONE OCCASION TO THE ADVERSARY TO SPEAK REPROACHFULLY.

When unsaved people, who do not have the Spirit of God, are able to discern impurity, danger, and error, better than many fundamental Christians, it certainly means that the preaching in many of our churches has been compromised. It is a grave day when heathens, on the basis of their consciences alone, have more light than many Christians!:

Romans 2:24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

Television, in many ways, has become an idol in the churches:

2 Timothy 3:4 ...lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God...

People may ask, "When will you quit preaching on television and movies?" I will quit when so many fundamentalists quit justifying the sin of viewing this depraved, sick, worldly, bloody, sensuous, violent, corrupt, blasphemous dung for entertainment. Is this offensive language? It is too bad that so many modern Christians are more offended at strong Bible preaching than they are at that vile sin that pours forth from the one-eyed devil in their living rooms every evening. If preachers will not take a stand by word and personal example to totally remove this ungodly idol from the home, individual Christians will feel justified in their sin. Many modern fundamental preachers, deacons and mature church members often publicly applaud and justify their favorite worldly television programs or movies. They allow their children to feed upon the bluish filth. Meanwhile, we hear reports that the unholy "singer" who calls herself "Madonna" does not let her children watch TV! And notice the following recent news report:

"Cruise and Spielberg keep their kids away from TV - Berlin (Reuters) - Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg, two of Hollywood's biggest celebrities, said on Thursday that they strictly limit how much television their children watch and emphasise reading rather than viewing. 'My kids, I really don't like them to watch that much television,' actor Tom Cruise said...'I can actually see the difference when they watch too much television in terms of their education when they're reading, in terms of their attention span, their behaviour,' he said. Spielberg, who directed Cruise in "Minority Report" and spoke at a joint news conference ahead of its Berlin premiere, is as twice as permissive as Cruise when it comes to television....Spielberg, whose films 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List' chronicled dark episodes of World War Two, said he also keeps his children away from contemporary television news. 'I don't let them watch the news because the news is much more uncensored than it was when I was growing up....'..."

If worldly celebrities go this far in protecting their own children from immorality and stupidity, how much further should fundamental Christians go in protecting their families? They should remove the idol from the home, or at least unhook the worldly programming from the television. Don't worry. You will not really miss anything:

1 John 2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

1 Thessalonians 5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

Psalms 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

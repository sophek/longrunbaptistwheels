DID JESUS LOOK LIKE A 1970's ROCK SINGER?
**********************************************
1 Corinthians 11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch
as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the
man.
14 Doth not even NATURE itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair,
it is a shame unto him?

Paul grounds the fact that a man is meant by God to have short hair in
both the creation, and in the law of conscience (i.e. nature). "Nature" is
defined by Paul to be the sense of propriety that man has in his
conscience, apart from the written law:

Romans 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, DO BY NATURE
the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
themselves:
15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
conscience also bearing witness...

Therefore, it is a timeless principle that men are to have short hair.
Only the Nazarites had long hair. This plainly shows that it was not
normal for Jews to have long hair. They were forbidden to grow their hair
long, on one hand; yet they were also forbidden to go to the opposite
extreme and shave their heads (except in great mourning), or possess
mohawks, "punk" haircuts, etc. (like the Canaanites):

Deuteronomy 14:1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not
cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

Leviticus 19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither
shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.

We can see something like this today; it is currently popular for many
worldly kids to leave a little hair on the very top of the scalp, but
shave the entire bottom and SIDES of the head. These types of markings are
rebellious. As our society continues to decline and decay, hairstyles are
growing more savage (like ancient Canaanites). Notice the followings words
in Ezekiel:
 
Ezekiel 44:20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks
to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

According to this verse, The "monkish" or "skinhead" look (if it is
intentional) is just as wrong as the "hippie" look.

Jesus was a "Nazarene," not a Nazarite (Matthew 2:23). He drank of the
pure, unfermented vine (Mark 14:25, Matthew 11:19), which was forbidden to
one who had a Nazarite vow. Although all nations certainly did not live up
to the light of their conscience at all times, there are enough ancient
quotes from poets, philosophers, etc. (outside the Bible) against long
hair on men to show that this is a natural law. We cannot trust Catholic
art! Our Lord did not put on a woman's garment, nor did He wear His hair
in an effeminate fashion. He was not soft. He was not a Hollywood glamour
"star." He possessed a beard (Isaiah 50:6). The short length of His hair
reflected the timeless truth of creation, that man was made in the image
of God, and is a picture of authority.

******************************************************************
WHY I WILL NOT SEE GIBSON'S MOVIE, "THE PASSION OF CHRIST"
******************************************************************
Hebrews 7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, SEPARATE FROM SINNERS, and made higher than the heavens;

"THE PASSION OF CHRIST" (Rated R for sequences of graphic violence.)

Mel Gibson is a traditionalist Roman Catholic. Reportedly, his new film
seeks to portray the last hours of Christ's life and His subsequent
resurrection. Gibson is calling for Christian pastors to stir up interest
in the new film. The movie will be released on Feb. 25, which is
Catholicism's Ash Wednesday. Should Christian pastors view this film and
encourage their churches to flock to the local theaters in support of
Gibson?

Perhaps most Christians would answer that this would be an excellent time
to support a "good" movie. And I am afraid that many of the pastors that
will preview this film will come away "emotionally moved," finding little
wrong with the movie. Why? Because the Bible teaches that "evil
communications corrupt good manners" (1 Corinthians 15:33). In a similar
fashion, it teaches us, "He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but
a companion of fools shall be destroyed." (Proverbs 13:20). In short, when
Christians consume the world's folly, and sit before fools, they soon end
up conformed to the world themselves. Their discernment grows dim. It does
not take long before they are practically, "laughing with the boys" at
bloody, gory, human suffering, complete with all the special effects. They
become unmoved by sexual innuendos (or downright nudity). Then, in an
effort to justify their sinful habit before their own seared consciences,
they begin to find and praise the supposed "redeeming qualities" of
various flicks. Modern movies become the Sunday morning sermon text, and
this, in turn, is justified on the basis of being "culturally relevant"
(this last phrase holds more pastoral iniquity that Ruth's veil could hold
barley - Ruth 3:15).

It doesn't really take much thought to understand that Gibson is simply
capitalizing (what his underlying motives are only God knows) on the
modern trend in the "conservative" movement to take "worthy" historical
themes (such as brutal wars, etc.), and, with the power of modern
technology and special effects, "bring the GORE to life." The "worthy
theme" is the "form of godliness" that these "conservatives" use to
justify viewing the gore, the immodesty, the blasphemy, etc. And they have
had so much of it, that they really think such movies are CLEAN. They are
drunk with the spirit of the world, wherein men are "lovers of pleasures
more than lovers of God" (2 Timothy 3:4). And many true, born-again
Christians are too often right there among these fleshly people. We can
now understand what Paul meant when he predicted that the time will come
when days would be WORSE than they were in his own day (2 Timothy 3:1).
Many years after Paul, Tertullian still testified that the liberal,
Gnostic heretics he was opposing were not so immoral that they viewed the
Roman games or theater! Tertullian simply argued that their irresponsible
view of God would "logically" justify their going to the ungodly theater.
But today, the insatiable lust for more violent gore attracts the worldly
Christians like a devilish magnet. And often, in at least one scene or
two, the sensual lust of the eyes is also fulfilled. As the husband or
wife openly gazes on the exposed flesh, in order to salve the conscience,
he or she says, "I wish they would not ruin these good movies with such
scenes." But the addiction to flesh only grows stronger as the light of
discernment grows weaker.

Indeed, we can reasonably guess that there are thousands of Christians who
cannot wait to gaze their eyes upon a naked, "Hollywood Jesus," and behold
the nails being driven into his bloody hands and feet - with special
effects (as they eat their popcorn with fake, chemical butter). Do I sound
cynical and bitter? I am happy and blessed to be free from this bondage to
the cinema and worldly television. Yet, I am grieved at the Devil's
devouring. I do not want to forget that we are at war. It grieves me to
see professing Christians act like little lap dogs, BEGGING the world to
throw them a doggie-treat with "Jesus" written on it. God forbid! This
illustration reminds me of a quote from Spurgeon:

"I believe that one reason why the church of God at this present moment
has so little influence over the world is because the world has so much
influence over the church!....If you have a hungering after such dog's
meat, GO DOGS, AND EAT THE GARBAGE!....Your duty as a Christian is to
stand fast in your own place, and to stand out for God, hating even the
garment spotted by the flesh....Come, ye children of God, you must stand
with your Lord outside the camp. Jesus calls you today, and says, 'Follow
Me.' WAS JESUS FOUND AT THE THEATER? Did He frequent the sports of the
race-course? Was Jesus seen, think you, in any of the amusements of the
Herodian court? Not He. He was 'holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate
from sinners.' In one sense, no one mixed with sinners so completely as He
did when, like a physician, He went among them healing His patients; but,
in another sense, there was a gulf fixed between the men of the world and
the Saviour, which He never essayed to cross, and which they could not
cross to defile Him....Follow Jesus into the separated state....Unless you
take up your cross, and protest against an ungodly world, you cannot hope
that Jesus will make you fishers of men."
(C. H. Spurgeon)

The Lord calls His disciples to be salt and light. True religion includes
keeping ourselves unspotted from the world.

In summary, as for me and my house, we will not see the Gibson movie for
the following reasons:

1. It is made by Roman Catholics. Mel Gibson, "was raised in the Catholic
faith and considers himself a traditionalist who loves the Latin Mass. He
has a priest on the set who offers a Latin Mass and hears confessions from
whomever wishes to take part." (New York Daily News). It is in dead
languages (to give it that "traditional Catholic mass" feel?). It is
filmed in Italy. The man who plays Jesus (i.e. Caviezel) is a devout
Catholic. And since Catholics do not understand what our Lord meant by,
"It is finished" (John 19:30), I have no interest in seeing a movie from
them about our Lord's Crucifixion! Furthermore, the Bible teaches that
Rome will revive in these last days (Revelation 17), and the movie theater
is playing a large role in promoting this unholy revival.

2. I never trust Hollywood, or anyone associated with "stars," and the
movie industry, to put out a movie without either fornication, lust, GORY
VIOLENCE, or something that compromises the ear-gate or the eye-gate, or
the imaginations (Proverbs 4:23-27). The man who plays Jesus, states:
"'Mel likes to put violence in his movies....By the time [audiences] get
to the crucifixion scene, I believe there will be many who can't take it
and will have to walk out - I guarantee it." They promise that the,
"audience will FEEL it is watching an actual crucifixion." (New York Daily
News).

3. Video causes "someone else" to become our eyes. It is a surrender of
the eyes to another power. But God calls us to be in control of our own
eyes:

Proverbs 4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
straight before thee.

As the camera gazes, with close-ups, on the bodies and faces of these
"stars," the eyes of Christians must view these men and women in a way
that would not be proper if they were simply in the same room with them,
in real life. Furthermore, I have no desire to see a Hollywood "star" (who
has "starred" in other, unwholesome movies and scenes) play the part of my
Lord. Plus, Jesus did not have long hair. And such false, though
influential, representations can supercede the influence of the Scriptures
in our mind's eye.

In conclusion, there are some things we were not meant to "see" in video,
for entertainment. We do not need to "see" a movie about Adam "knowing"
his wife. Those who argue that "violence is in the Bible," forget that
there are MANY THINGS in the Bible! Will such Christians march to the
theater if an R-rated "portrayal" of the Song of Solomon arrives in
theaters near you?! Many Christians do not realize that this modern
addiction to violent gore is simply the outer fringes of a budding revival
of Canaanite cannibalism (Numbers 13:32). This lust will continue to grow
until it will not be satisfied until it views "real life" suffering, as in
the Roman circus (e.g. notice the current success of REALITY shows). And
the carnal Christians who helped fund and promote this lust for blood -
may one day find themselves the victims of it!

CROZER COLLEGE, MARTIN LUTHER KING, AND END-TIME APOSTASY
*********************************************************************

The following excerpts are from a recent article in "Main Line Today,"
wherein I am thankful to be quoted in protest of modern, apostate
Christendom:

"...In 1948, Martin Luther King Jr. came to Chester to study for the
ministry at Crozer Theological Seminary. Crozer began getting ready for
King long before....Loosely affiliated with the Baptists, Crozer - which
merged with Colgate Rochester Divinity School and moved to upstate New
York in 1970 - trained many of the progressive clergy who later carried
the Social Gospel banner and was early a nest of unorthodox ideas.
Crozer's crimes included the absence of a written creed, professors who
questioned traditional doctrine, pacifist speakers and the inclusion of
non-Christian ideas in the curriculum. Wrapping up such craziness in a
neat bow was Crozer's 1951 graduation of Martin Luther King Jr., who would
be Crozer's best-known alumnus and a literal poster-child for social
activism....In the early 20th Century, however, it was Vedder who
attracted the most attention to Crozer....Vedder graduated from the
seminary in 1873, then spent 18 years writing for Baptist papers. He came
to Crozer in the 1890s, but continued to write. And when, in his middle
age, Vedder began to lean toward modernist concepts, those sentiments
inevitably showed up in his work. In 1908, Vedder published 'Our New
Testament: How Did We Get It?' which questioned the Bible's divine
inspiration. Wrote Vedder: 'The true foundation of the Christian's faith
is not a book, but a personâ€¦not the New Testament, but Jesus
Christ.'....Widening the divide were subsequent books, 'Socialism and The
Ethics of Jesus' (1912), which caused consternation among business
leaders, and 'The German Reformation' (1914), in which Vedder criticized
the Bible's elevation to the status of 'paper pope' by Martin Luther and
his fellow reformers. None of this sat well with conservatives and, even
today, conservative Christians - especially southern Baptists - point to
Vedder as an example of what's wrong with liberals. In Venus, Texas,
pastor Joey Faust quotes Vedder on the website of his independent Kingdom
Baptist Church simply to illustrate 'the extent that a man's mind can be
taken captive by Satan.' In 1922, Vedder published 'Fundamentals of
Christianity,' which condemned the concept of vicarious atonement through
the death and resurrection of Christ. 'It is quite in accord with human
indolence that men should look for a salvation to be accomplished in
something done for them,' wrote Vedder. 'The ideal of Jesus is a salvation
accomplished by men, not for them, from within, not from
without.'....Although he was the son of a clergyman, Martin Luther King
Jr. had not initially been attracted to the ministry. As a young teen, he
had shocked his Sunday school teacher by questioning the bodily
resurrection of Jesus. 'I had doubts that religion was intellectually
respectable,' he told 'Time' magazine in its 1964 'Man of the Year' story.
'I revolted against the emotionalism of Negro religion, the shouting and
the stamping. I didn't understand it and it embarrassed me.'....Morehouse
president Benjamin Mays pointed him to Crozer where he arrived expecting
to be a token Negro. Instead, a third of the students were black. Crozer
fed King's hunger for a Christian philosophy not mired in
doctrine.....'From Gandhi,' he [King] later said, 'I learned my
operational technique.'...."

Comments: It is too bad that King did not read or believe the following
verses:

1 Corinthians 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will
bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this
world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,
it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

"....save them that believe." Now, that is something to shout about!

It has been reported that Jack Van Impe has been regularly pushing his new
video against "that book by J. D. Faust" on his television  programs. My
response to this video is on our website at http://www.kingdombaptist.org.
Van Impe is doing the truth of the Judgment Seat a great favor, even
though he is against it. He is unwittingly preaching the Gospel of the
KINGDOM in all the world - even though he is trying to oppose it.

SOME NOTABLE COMMENTS FROM READERS
*********************************************

"I live in Melbourne, Australia, a city of over 3.5 million people.  In
the course of my work I visited the road traffic control room for the
whole of Melbourne and outskirts. Afterwards a fellow nerd showed me
around, including the surveillance room with dozens of screens. They have
surveillance cameras all over Melbourne. I was shown how they can track a
particular car leaving a building, then along all the roads it travelled
(to its next destination if we'd wanted to). Then I was shown the power of
the cameras. On one of the screens there was a car stopped by the side of
the road on a freeway ramp. They zoomed in, and I could see the man
(middle aged, round face, Caucasian, balding) standing by the car &
drumming his fingers on the roof, probably waiting for a break-down
repair. The camera zoomed in again to the front seat & I could see a book
on the passenger seat, which by its design & size was the Melbourne street
directory..."

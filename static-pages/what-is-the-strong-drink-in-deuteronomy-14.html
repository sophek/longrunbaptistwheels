        <h1>WHAT IS THE STRONG DRINK IN DEUTERONOMY 14?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "Just a quick question. Something I cannot seem to understand here. I know the Word tells us we should not use strong drink, and I believe that Jesus didn't even make wine with alcohol, but what is Deut. 14:26 talking about? It seems as though God is giving the ok for strong drink, even though it is denounced other places in the scriptures...De 14:26
'And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household...' If you could help me understand this, I would appreciate it." (Bro. David)

ANSWER: In regard to your question, this comes from the misunderstanding concerning the phrase "strong drink." We naturally think of "strong" as applying to the BITTER taste of fermentation, as in "whiskey" etc. However, "strong drink" can actually be fermented OR unfermented (and is used in both contexts, like the word "wine"), since the "strong" does not refer to the BITTERNESS of alcohol, but to the RICH FLAVOR of the substance. Notice:

Isaiah 24:9 They shall not drink wine with a song; STRONG DRINK SHALL BE BITTER to them that drink it.
12 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.

In this verse, God is saying that because they are JUDGED, the "strong drink" will be "bitter." This shows that it is not ordinarily bitter. It actually refers to the RICHNESS of the drink. You will find somewhat the same language today. A liquid is "weak" when it has been mixed with a lot of water. Thus, in the grocery store, many will buy what they think is "juice," but it is actually colored water with high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavoring, and maybe a wee little bit of real juice. Naturally, they sell this "weak" stuff really cheap. However, at a health food store you will find the "strong drink." It is "strong" because it is 100% pure juice, with no added water. It will have sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The "strong" refers to the richness of the taste and flavor. This strong drink, even in our day sometimes contains alcohol (as in orange juice and vodka, etc.). But it Deuteronomy 14, it is referring to some rich, non-alcoholic substance that will bring true joy and health to the body. It is not "raging," and it does not bite as a serpent!

        <h1>IS WINE HEALTHY?</h1>

            <blockquote>"Red wine could help treat Aids and cancer - ...Scientists from a range of disciplines assembled to discuss the health benefits at the University Victor Segalen in Bordeaux...The health benefits of living in France, noted as early as 1890 by an Irish physician, were thought to lie in the local diet, notably red wine. But alcohol was found to increase the risk of harmful clotting an hour after consumption. However, Prof Serge Renaud of the University Victor Segalen, said that this effect was absent in red wine, probably because it contained polyphenols, substances that had been shown to have remarkable biological properties, responsible for the colour of grapes and found in their skins and seeds..."

Those struggling so hard to find a justification for DRINKING will not give up. Even most of the conservative news sites appear to JUMP ON every report that seems to slightly justify DRINKING. This is no doubt because there are probably many Christians working for these organizations and they are CONVICTED. Here are the facts: If you drink pure red GRAPE JUICE moderately you will then get ALL the healthy benefits of fermented wine WITHOUT the UNHEALTHY physical and spiritual consequences! Alcohol is a poison that hurts the precious organs of the body while it makes the precious mind dull and STUPID (Ho.4:11). The Bible says wine-drinkers have a tendency to take their clothes off (Gen.9:21, 19:32, Hab.2:15). Godly Jews knew that only daughters of Belial DRINK fermented wine: 1Sa 1:15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have DRUNK neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. 16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: Certainly some of these Christians defending wine drinking have seen (hopefully BEFORE their conversion) worldly girls made giddy and tipsy on only A FEW SIPS of fermented wine! If they will preach "moderation" why then don't they also WARN most young women that "moderation" will certainly make them DRUNK? Yet, we hear no such warnings. Plus, who defines DRUNK? Moderate drinkers all have their own ideas about it. And the same amount of alcohol can effect different people in different ways. Are you supposed to experiment and risk getting a little drunk to find how much you can "handle"? Also, how much you can "handle" will often depend on whether or not you have eaten, whether or not you are tired, etc. It is all VERY subjective. Therefore, many "moderate" wine drinkers often get up from a meal with a HEAD RUSH. They do all this, even though the Bible teaches that the KINGDOM OF GOD will be missed for DRUNKENNESS (1 Cor.6:10). The Bible uses the word "wine" in a dual sense. It often means simply unfermented grape juice: Isa 65:8 Â¶ Thus saith the LORD, As the new WINE is found in the CLUSTER, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all. Isa 27:2 In that day sing ye unto her, A VINEYARD of RED WINE. If Jesus made fermented wine, where was the "moderation"? The Bible says He made it after they were WELL DRUNK! (John 2:10) God's wise, obedient servants are not even to LOOK at fermented wine: Pr 23:31 LOOK NOT thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. Fermented wine is dangerous in itself. It is also a picture of sin (Eph.5:18, Jer.51:7, etc.). Messing with a "little" sin almost always leads to BIG sin (Rom.13:14, Gal.5:8). The ancient Jews certainly knew how to preserve juice from fermenting. This has been documented multiple times in this newsletter. One way was to boil it down to a thick syrup and then as water as needed. If you want to be healthy, drink some pure grape juice every so often. If you want to gamble with sin and be a stumbling block for others, drink a little fermented wine.

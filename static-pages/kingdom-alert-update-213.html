Philippians 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.Â 

******************************************
THE BIBLE'S SCIENTIFIC FOREKNOWLEDGE (PART 1)
******************************************Â 

1 Thessalonians 1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and IN MUCH ASSURANCE [i.e. proof]; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.Â 

We live in an age where the word BELIEF is despised. It has been redefined into meaning a BLIND FAITH with no ground or evidence. By raising up RATIONALISTS and DEISTS who worship at the throne of UNAIDED REASON (no Bible as its ground), Satan has been able to chase many Christians into EASTERN MYSTICISM (though called by different names). As we have seen over and over again, this is a common device of the Devil. In earlier generations, Christians were able to meet the objections of so-called "rationalists," without RETREATING from the fort of REASON. They understood the following verses:Â 

Isaiah 1:18 Come now, and LET US REASON TOGETHER, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.Â 

2 Thessalonians 3:2 And that we may be delivered from UNREASONABLE and wicked men: for all men have not FAITH.Â 

Christians who encountered the early Deists wrote such words as the
following:Â 

"I express myself with caution, lest I should be mistaken to VILIFY REASON, which is indeed the only faculty we have wherewith to judge concerning any thing, even revelation itself..." (Joseph Butler, "The Analogy of Religion," 1736)Â 

Notice how Butler, in his attempt to prove that reason alone (without God's revelation) is insufficient, refuses to RETREAT into eastern mysticism. Yet, by the 20th century, many Christians had retreated. They embraced the lie that "faith" means to "believe contrary to any evidence."Â 

In the Bible, "faith" means to believe based on God's promises when the physical eye or outward circumstances "appear" to argue against them. But this is not contrary to true reason! The most REASONABLE thing a person can do is believe God before man and his own limited vision. This is why the Bible describes the final apostasy as being ANIMALISTIC and contrary to reason. It will be based on FEELINGS:Â 

Jude 1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as BRUTE beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
19 These be they who separate themselves, SENSUAL, having not the Spirit.Â 

"Brute" means unreasonable or irrational.Â 

With this introduction, let us notice how God CONFIRMS His revelation to man by EVIDENCE:Â 

Mark 16:20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and CONFIRMING THE WORD with signs following. Amen. (See 1 Thessalonians 1:5)Â 

We do not Apostles who have seen the Lord today. But does that mean we do not have any miraculous demonstrations that the revelation of Scripture is inspired? Absolutely not. While God is free to bear witness to His Word by whatever means He chooses, we have today the BENEFIT of beholding one of the most amazing EVIDENCES of the inspiration of our Bible than could be imagined:Â 

2 Peter 1:19 We have also A MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:Â 

We are certainly living in dark times. But sadly, all around us God is CONFIRMING His Scripture, yet hardly no one is taking heed to it. Just a few "wise men" came from the East after studying the prophecies. And the star appeared to their eyes. Today, the truths of the Scriptures are being CONFIRMED by PROPHECY. We will not even mentioned direct prophecies in this series. We will only deal with SCIENTIFIC FOREKNOWLEDGE. We have in our Bible, multiple amazing statements that were made centuries before modern scientists have been able, by the scientific method, to discover them. A skeptic may could call one or two a "coincidence" or "guess"; but the dozens of examples which could be cited DEFY ALL ODDS. They are truly INFALLIBLE PROOFS (Acts 1:3) of DIVINE INSPIRATION.Â 

Notice a few of these amazing examples below. They are greater evidence for our faith than seeing a young lady raised from the dead:Â

DIFFERING TIME ZONESÂ 

**************************Â 

Luke 17:30 Even thus shall it be in THE DAY when the Son of man is revealed.
34 I tell you, IN THAT NIGHT there shall be two men in one BED; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
35 Two women shall be GRINDING TOGETHER; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
36 Two men shall be IN THE FIELD; the one shall be taken, and the other left.Â 

A person in the U.S. can call the Philippines today and realize that there are different time zones! The Bible (written by the Holy Ghost) understood it centuries ago.Â

STARS TOO NUMEROUS TO COUNTÂ 

************************************Â 

Deuteronomy 4:19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and THE STARS, even all THE HOST OF HEAVEN...Â 

Jeremiah 33:22 As THE HOST OF HEAVEN CANNOT BE NUMBERED, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant...Â 

-Ptolemy (127-151 A.D.) counted 1056 stars.Â 

-Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) counted 777 stars.Â 

-Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) counted 1005 stars.Â 

-Scientists today believe that our own galaxy alone has 100 billion stars!Â 

The college textbook, "Young's Astronomy," in 1898, knew of nothing beyond our own galaxy but EMPTY SPACE. Scientists today believe that there are trillions of other galaxies!Â

FIRE BENEATH THE EARTHÂ 

******************************Â 

Job 28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and UNDER IT IS TURNED UP AS IT WERE FIRE.Â 

Out of the earth comes wheat and other grains from which bread is made.Â 

But UNDER the earth something is "turned up" as it were fire! In the past few years, many scientific magazines have published articles about the fiery "hurricanes" occurring in the heart of the earth! The Bible is always ahead of the scientists by many centuries:Â 

"A few years ago we said the central four thousand miles of the earth were SOLID steel....the revised theory is that the center of the earth is MOLTEN STEEL." (Peter W. Stoner, "Science Speaks," 1969)Â 

The Bible teaches in many places that hell is down, that it has many levels, and that it has fire:Â 

Matthew 11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought DOWN TO HELL...Â 

Mark 9:47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast INTO HELL FIRE:Â 

Today, scientists are discovering that the UNDERWORLD is hotter than they ever imagined:Â 

"Scientists in the UK have calculated the temperature at the centre of the Earth is 5,500 Â¢XC - hotter than many previous estimates and almost as hot as the surface of the Sun....The idea that we are sitting on top of a seething mass of molten iron as hot as the Sun may be pretty scary', remarks Professor Mike Gillan, a theorist in UCL's Physics and Astronomy Department and a co-author of the report." (News In Science, abc.net.au.com; September 30, 1999)Â 

Technology is now being invented to dig deeper than ever before
imaginable:Â 

"....a California researcher is proposing to send a probe that would surf a wave of molten iron on a weeklong journey to the center of the Earth.Â 

CalTech geophysicist David Stevenson knows his proposal is far-fetched.Â 

But billions of dollars are spent exploring space every year, he says, and the planet's interior is equally mysterious and deserves similar study.Â 

The Earth's core, after all, creates the magnetic field that keeps compasses pointing north and deadly radiation in space from reaching the planet's surface. Scientists know from seismic data that the core is solid, and THE OUTER CORE IN MOLTEN, but many questions remain....The grapefruit-sized probe would have to be made of a special alloy that could withstand the molten iron as well as the intense pressure and heat at the center of the Earth....University of Connecticut geophysicist Vernon Cormier said intense heat and pressure makes it impossible to drill down to the core...." (CBSNews.com, May 15, 2003)Â 

Amos 9:2 THOUGH THEY DIG INTO HELL, thence shall mine hand take them...Â 

*******************************************Â 

COLONIES DEEP BENEATH THE EARTHÂ 

*******************************************Â 

Notice the following Bible verses:Â 

Philippians 2:10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and THINGS UNDER THE EARTH.Â 

Revelation 5:3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither UNDER THE EARTH, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.Â 

Amos 9:2 Though they DIG INTO HELL, thence shall mine hand take them...Â 

These Bible verses are interesting in light of the technology and goals of modern science:Â 

"Sub-Urban Renewal - Thanks to new tunneling technologies, real estate trends are down. Way down....The world's cities may be overcrowded, and the suburbs that surround them may be choked by unchecked sprawl, but there's plenty of undeveloped space. It's right at your feet: underground.Â 

There are 100 quadrillion cubic feet of undeveloped metropolitan real estate in this country alone, and that's counting just the first mile down....You won't hear much talk of it outside of specialized engineering circles, but we're at a tipping point. The cost to burrow down is dropping, while the price (and hassle) of erecting a skyscraper in a dense urban area just keeps rising. The breakthrough comes thanks to tunneling technologies that are now being used on huge transportation projects....Over the next 10 years these techniques will be used to hollow out space beneath the world's great cities....Take humans out of the digging process and the price of a hole starts to fall. Automation began in the 1950s...Within a decade, digs will be entirely automated, run by people sitting in aboveground trailers or even in offices a thousand miles away....By 2005, some under-urban highway projects will start to include parking lots. Where there is parking, malls will spring up. By 2008, developers might offer these retailers subterranean warehouse space, then offices, and, finally, full-fledged industrial parks. By 2013, we could see some hotels, probably marketed to international commuters and located just below the financial centers of Tokyo, London, and New York....Some cities have already started to expand underground. Both Toronto and Montreal have extensive downtown retail complexes below the surface....tenants prefer the location because the ambient temperature of Earth's crust - about 57 degrees Fahrenheit year-round - keeps energy costs low." (Wired.com, April 2003)Â 

It is very possible that there will be THOUSANDS living DEEP below the earth's surface when Christ returns.Â 

*******************************Â 

COLONIES IN OUTER SPACEÂ 

*******************************Â 

But the verse in Amos also mentions heaven:Â 

Amos 9:2 ...though they CLIMB UP TO HEAVEN, thence will I bring them down:Â 

Obadiah 1:4 ...though thou SET THY NEST AMONG THE STARS, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.Â 

Psalms 139:8 IF I ASCEND UP INTO HEAVEN, THOU ART THERE: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.Â 

Deuteronomy 30:4 If ANY OF THINE BE DRIVEN OUT UNTO THE OUTMOST PARTS OF HEAVEN, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:Â 

Mark 13:27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall GATHER together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth TO THE UTTERMOST PART OF HEAVEN.Â 

There is no reason to take these verses in a hypothetical or figurative sense. Instead, they are evidences of supernatural foreknowledge.Â 

According to NASA's web site, man INTENDS to place floating space colonies into space. They will one day probably BANISH obedient Christians into these space colonies:Â 

"Space settlements should be a place for ordinary people. Presently, with few exceptions, only highly trained and carefully selected astronauts go to space. Space settlement needs inexpensive, safe launch systems to deliver thousands, perhaps millions, of people into orbit. Note that a hundred years ago nobody had ever flown in an airplane, but today nearly 500 million people a year fly. Some religious groups might prefer to live away from 'unbelievers'....Eventually most people in space settlements will be born there, and some day they may vastly exceed Earth's population..."

THE EARTH HANGS UPON NOTHINGÂ 

**************************************Â 

-The Earth has Foundations:Â 

Psalms 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.Â 

1 Samuel 2:8 ...for THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.Â 

Jeremiah 31:37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.Â 

-Man Cannot Find Any Physical Substance Upon Which These Foundations Rest:Â 

Job 38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
declare, if thou hast understanding.
6 WHEREUPON ARE THE FOUNDATIONS THEREOF FASTENED? or who laid the corner stone thereof;Â 

-The Foundations of the Earth Rest Upon Nothing!:Â 

Job 26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth THE EARTH UPON NOTHING.Â 

Hebrews 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and UPHOLDING ALL THINGS by the word of his power...
10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the FOUNDATION of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:Â 

"The whole earth hangs upon the word of God's power, and shall not our faith hang upon the word of God's truth?" (Thomas Watson)Â 

The Bible knew, thousands of years before scientists could verify it, that the earth hangs on NOTHING. Amazing!Â 

**********************************Â 

HYDROLOGIC (WATER) CYCLEÂ 

**********************************Â 

Ecclesiastes 1:7 ALL THE RIVERS run INTO THE SEA; yet THE SEA IS NOT FULL; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.Â 

How did the Bible know that the water is RECYCLED? Some rivers dump millions of gallons every second into seas. Where does all the extra water go? How did the Bible writers know that the water is evaporated to the sky and falls on the mountains as rain, and then runs into the sea?:Â 

Amos 9:6 ...he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.Â 

Psalms 135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. [see also Jeremiah 51:16]Â 

The Bible's scientific foreknowledge is amazing! God has given us MUCH ASSURANCE (1 Thessalonians 1:5) is our day! Unbelievers and scoffers will therefore be held ACCOUNTABLE for their rejection of the Holy Bible. God has not only inspired it, He has PRESERVED it for us. And almost every day, if we will seek, we will find CONFIRMATIONS that we can use to EVANGELIZE others and break down their oppositions of science falsely so called.Â 

And if God has given us so much assurance of His promises, should we not believe? Should we not respond give Him our all? Nothing awaits us but death (unless the rapture occurs). So let us confess every truth we know on the housetops. Let us hold nothing back. Let us give of our influence, time and funds to support our local churches, and God's work abroad:Â 

"The sea is not a miser's storehouse for a wealth of waters, for as by one force the waters flow into it, by another they are lifted from it....That man is out of joint with the universe who takes all but makes no return.Â 

To give to others is but sowing seed for ourselves. He who is so good a steward as to be willing to use his substance for his Lord, shall be entrusted with more. Friend of Jesus, art thou rendering to him according to the benefit received? Much has been given thee, what is thy fruit? Hast thou done all? Canst thou not do more?" (Charles H. Spurgeon, "Morning and Evening")Â

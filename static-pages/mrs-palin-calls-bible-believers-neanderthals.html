        <h1>MRS. PALIN CALLS BIBLE BELIEVERS NEANDERTHALS</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Mrs. Palin recently reproved people who believe that mothers with small children should stay at home and guide the house:
â€œIt kind of seems, Geraldine, that some things havenâ€™t changed,â€ Palin said. â€œThere are still the Neanderthals out there who pick on the petty, little, superficial, meaningless things â€“ like looks, like whether you can or canâ€™t work outside of the home if you have small children â€“ all those type of things where I would so hope that at some point those Neanderthals will evolve into something a bit more with it, a bit more modern, and a bit more understanding that, yeah, women can accomplish much.â€

This is a shocking statement by Sarah Palin. She is facing her critics head on. But this time, she is resisting God. The Holy Bible plainly teaches older women to teach the younger women to be keepers at home, and to love their husbands and children (see Titus 2). It plainly teaches mothers to guide the house (1 Timothy 5:14), so the enemies of God will not have a cause to criticize Christianity! It is obvious, even to many unbelievers (especially in some other countries), that mothers need to be with their children, and children need to be with their mothers. Mothers should not be distracted with careers.  Mrs. Palin professes Christ, and she needs to be a good example of Christianity and of motherhood. But to justify herself, she has adopted the feminism of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, etc. Mrs. Palin should read â€œThe Womenâ€™s Bibleâ€ written by Cady Stanton, and see what the early feminist leaders that she praises really believe! They believed that the Holy Bible must be destroyed! Stanton mocked the Bible, and did not believe it is the Word of God. She writes:
â€œI do not believe that God inspired the Mosaic code.â€
Mrs. Palin has sided with some of the greatest Christ-haters, and Bible haters the world has ever seen. And she has called fundamental Bible believers â€“ people who simply believe God;s commandments should be obeyed â€“ Neanderthals â€“ an evolutionary term. May God open her eyes to see the harm she has done by trying to justify herself in this manner.

        <h1>THE BEAST IN THE SKY: NEW DRONE CAN LOOK INTO HOUSES</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote>Residents of Miami-Dade County, Florida, beware: Big Brother may soon be watching you â€” even inside your house.

The Miami-Dade Police Department has purchased an aerial drone, the Honeywell T-Hawk, that will allow the department to â€œtrack suspects, sweep past houses, and peep through windows,â€Â <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-12-09/news/miami-dade-police-buy-drones/" target="_blank">according to theÂ <em>Miami New Times</em></a>. The drone, similar to those used by the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan, will be equipped with cameras to spy wherever and whenever the cops choose to deploy it. Weighing in at 20 pounds, the drone can fly for 40 minutes at a time, climb as high as 10,500 feet, and cruise at 46 miles per hour.

The police, naturally, insist that the $50,000 vehicle, thought to have been purchased with a federal grant, is there merely to keep citizens and officers safe. â€œIt gives us a good opportunity to have an eye up there. Not a surveilling eye, not a spying eye. Letâ€™s make the distinction. A surveilling eye to help us to do the things we need to do, honestly, to keep people safe,â€Â <a href="http://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Miami-Police-Unmanned-Drone-Surveillance.html" target="_blank">Miami-Dade Police Director James Loftus said</a>.

Miami-Dade Sgt. Andrew Cohen â€œsaid [the] drone will be used to gather real time information in situations which may be too dangerous for officers,â€ theÂ <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/03/09/dade-cops-waiting-to-get-crime-fighting-drone-airborne/" target="_blank">Miami CBS affiliate reports</a>. â€œIf an SRT (Special Response Team) has to go into an area they donâ€™t know whatâ€™s there, we donâ€™t know what is in the backyard,â€ said Cohen, â€œThey want to know if there are dogs in the backyard, if there is a shed, things that could be a threat to us.â€

However, as Florida American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Howard Simon pointed out, â€œWhat happens when they fly over backyards and they see something without a warrant that they want to take [action] against?â€

Even worse, what if the drone peeks in your window and sees something the cops find suspicious? â€œPolice admit the [drone], if flown low enough, has the ability to look into peopleâ€™s home[s],â€ says the CBS affiliate, â€œbut that is not its intended purpose.â€ Little imagination is required to think of ways to rationalize expanding the use of the drone beyond its supposedly intended purposeâ€¦.â€

The Bible teaches that totalitarianism will be found around the world in the last days. In Revelation 17, the 10 kings of the earth, give their kingdoms to the Beast. They have absolute control to do so. Early prophecy writers predicted many years ago that governments would increase their red tape and their control. Perhaps repentance can bring a temporary revival. But in the end, the more we sin and love for self, the more the princes of the land increase!

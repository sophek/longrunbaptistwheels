HOW MUCH FREEDOM DO INCORPORATED CHURCHES POSSESS TODAY?

This past Wednesday, October 2, the House of Representatives defeated a bill that attempted to remove "some" of the restraints the IRS has placed upon 501c(3), non profit organizations (specifically incorporated churches). Walter Jones (a Republican congressman from North Carolina), is a Roman Catholic who authored the bill (Houses of Worship Political Speech). Many conservatives were very hopeful that this bill would not be defeated. However, the real issue is the fact that so many Christian pastors (and their churches) have technically agreed to be silent on crucial moral issues (that are often political issues) in the first place! Jesus Christ commissions the God-called pastor, not a government bureaucracy. Even so, this issue of the Kingdom Alert mainly addresses the question concerning how much freedom (to speak politically) "incorporated" churches currently possess. It will be seen that NO pastor or church really knows the answer to this question.

John the Baptist and Jesus openly addressed the MORAL CHARACTER of an official in public office (Matthew 14:4, Luke 13:32). When Paul preached against idolatry in Ephesus, he threatened the economy.

Acts 19:25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.
26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:
27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.

Therefore, it is obvious that in all ages "politics" and religion are often mingled together in many ways. This means that there are often financial, emotional, and/or physical consequences for publicizing certain truths. Christians are warned by Jesus Christ not to hide His words (ANY of them), or refuse to confess His truth for any reason (Mark 8:38, Matthew 10:27-28, John 12:42). Martin Luther once eloquently stated this truth (in words that are certainly more popular to quote than they are to actually obey and apply):

"If I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion of the truth of God except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ, however boldly I may be professing Christ. Where the battle rages, there the loyalty of the soldier is proved, and to be steady on all battle fields besides, is mere flight and disgrace if he flenches at that point."

In a future article, I will apply this quote to the subject of the fear of God (which is the whole beginning of the edifice of wisdom). Yet, the point at hand is that it is obvious that Jesus has called Christians to publicly confess every word of His truth. But are many churches hiding some of the Lord's light today?

Many believe that incorporated, registered churches have been practically muzzled since 1954 based on the vagueness in the wording of the law. These churches were restricted from lobbying in 1934. They were restricted from "endorsing" (vague word) a "candidate" (vague word) in 1954. Since no one knows for sure what the law really means, many choose to be silent in certain areas rather than risk a loss of their tax exempt status. This has, no doubt, certainly contributed to the moral decline in our nation in the second half of the 20th century.

Is it not absurd that a free nation that was birthed by a revolution spread from many fiery pulpits, would one day grow to silence pulpits "politically" (whatever "politically" means)? It is true that pastors are called to preach "the Word," not politics. However, as we have seen, "the Word" is often very political, since GOD desires His will to be obeyed in every area of our lives.

There have been two movements among Christians in the U.S. to attempt to remedy the problem of IRS restrictions on churches. For many years, fiery, fundamental Baptist pastor, Dr. Greg Dixon, has called churches to become totally unregistered (http://www.indianapolisbaptisttemple.com). Others, such as Dr. D. James Kennedy, have worked to remove some of the restrictions on 501c(3) church-organizations without changing their corporate or tax exempt status. Aside from the opposition of liberals and pagans, some critics of this latter movement have argued that the removal of these restrictions might ironically create more IRS oversight and involvement (reporting regulations, etc.) for churches. I am certainly always skeptical of anything Catholics are involved in. Yet, liberals and pagans have their own reasons for objecting to this movement. On the surface it appears to free churches (at least a little more than they are already). These groups do not want conservative churches involved in the election process anymore than they already are. The following information will be related to this movement, focusing primarily on the latest defeat of the Jones bill:

"House Defeats Politics-from-the-Pulpit Bill - (CNSNews.com) - Much to the dismay of conservatives, the House of Representatives Wednesday defeated a bill that would have allowed churches, synagogues and other religious organizations to preach politics from the pulpit, without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. An IRS rule imposed in 1954 banned partisan political activity at religious institutions, including endorsements of candidates. Conservatives mourned over the bill's defeat while liberals celebrated....Colby May, a senior counsel with the ACLJ, said it's unfortunate that 'it remains difficult and risky for religious leaders to speak out on the moral and political issues of the day from the pulpit because of the unfair and unconstitutional restrictions of the Internal Revenue Service.'....In 1999, the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of the Christian Coalition because it distributed voter guides in churches....Michael Schwartz, vice president for government relations for Concerned Women for America, agreed that the battle must continue to be fought. 'Congress was wrong 50 years ago when it empowered the IRS to censor sermons, and it was wrong again today.'..." (CNSNews.com, October 02, 2002)

"Consequently, the government may not censor churches' speech on moral issues of the day without running afoul of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Internal Revenue Code, however, has circumscribed the rights of 501(c)(3) organizations to engage in political speech. Thus, the First Amendment notwithstanding, churches who desire to retain their status as tax-exempt organizations under I.R.C. 501 (c)(3) must adhere to IRS restrictions on political speech....In exchange for receipt of tax-exempt status, I.R.C. 501(c)(3) absolutely prohibits churches and other tax-exempt organizations from campaigning for or against a candidate for public office: 'Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes ...no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation (except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)), and which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.'....Moreover, an organization's motive for engaging in campaign activity is irrelevant in determining whether the campaigning ban has been violated. The IRS has stated that the campaigning ban 'does not refer only to participation or intervention with a partisan motive, but to any participation or intervention which affects voter acceptance or rejection of a candidate.' - Revenue Ruling 78-160, 1978-1 C.B. 154....Neither the I.R.C. nor IRS regulations define the term 'candidate.'....under IRS guidelines, churches are free to discuss the moral issues of the day and also register persons to vote as long, as they do not support or oppose a particular candidate or political party. Again, whether the IRS' restrictions are truly constitutional is, in our view, highly doubtful."
(Jay Sekulow, ACLJ, http://www.aclj.org/Info/Irs501.Asp#I.)

"Rep. Walter Jones (R.-N.C.) has offered a bill that would repeal the law that now prevents churches from engaging in any political activity without losing their tax exempt status. The 'Houses of Worship Political Speech Protection Act,' HR 2357, would remove from the Internal Revenue (IRS) Code a 47-year-old law that has prompted some churches to avoid distributing voter guides or even taking positions on moral issues such as abortion that may be debated in political campaigns. 'This legislation removes the threatening hand of the IRS and extends the freedoms of the 1st Amendment to all houses of worship in America - as was the case in this country from its founding until 1954,' Jones told Human Events. 'All too many churches have been so chilled by the present language of the 501c(3) portion of the IRS code that they refuse to make important moral, ethical or scriptural statements that may touch on current political campaigns, or from permitting others to do so from their premises and their pulpits.'...Jones says that houses of worship engaging in political activity ceased to be 'part of the American tradition' because of Lyndon B. Johnson. As Senate Democratic leader in 1954, Johnson added an amendment to the IRS code banning 'nonprofit' groups from participating in 'any political campaign on behalf of any candidate.' 'This was done with a floor amendment, and there were no hearings or any congressional debate on the merits or reasons for this ban,' said Jones....In 1995, for example, the IRS stripped the tax exemption of the Church at Pierce Creek in Vestal, N. Y. for running full-page ads in USA Today and the Washington Times saying: 'Bill Clinton is promoting policies that are in rebellion of Gods law...How then can we vote for Bill Clinton?'...Interestingly, this element of the IRS code has not been aggressively enforced against liberal church leaders who shamelessly permit Democratic office-seekers to address their congregations from the pulpit. According to research by the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), the IRS compiled more than 562 examples of Democratic candidates appearing in African-American churches between 1987 and 1994. But not one lost its tax-exempt status..."

DR. D. JAMES KENNEDY'S TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTE ON OVERSIGHT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTE ON WAYS AND MEANS - HEARING ON REVIEW OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501 (c) (3) REQUIREMENTS FOR RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS:

"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the opportunity to be here. On behalf of the thousands of people who have signed petitions asking Congress to pass the Houses of Worship Political Speech Protections Act - some of which you see stacked on the table before me - I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the subcommittee....on July 2, 1954, as the Senate considered a major tax code revision, Johnson offered a floor amendment to ban all nonprofit 501(C)(3) groups from engaging in political activity. Without hearings or public debate, his amendment passed the Senate on a voice vote...That will change if 'The Houses of Worship Political Speech Protection Act,' introduced by Rep. Walter Jones, and cosponsored by 114 other Members, becomes law. Jones' bill will reverse Johnson's ban and return the protection of the First Amendment to America's churches, synagogues, and mosques. Today, the hearing that never took place 48 years ago is convening as the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee considers this bill....The unequal enforcement of the existing law is just one of several reasons why scrapping the political activity ban altogether is a good idea. The political activity restriction is a blatant violation of the First Amendment, is vague and burdensome, and marginalizes churches at a time when America most needs a moral compass. The First Amendment states that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech&amp;.' Yet that is exactly what the Congress has done by silencing churches. Nor is the political activity ban easy to obey. Not just endorsements, but voter education activities, such as voter guides that compare office-seekers on issues, may violate the ban if they are perceived as partisan. Even addressing moral concerns, such as abortion, from the pulpit during an election campaign may violate the IRS rule if abortion, for example, is under debate in the campaign. With so much uncertainty and so much at risk, silence is, regrettably, the only option for the minister who wants to ensure that the IRS does not open a file on his church. But when Caesar's demand for silence confronts the message of God's Word, ministers are forced into hard choices. That's what happened in Nazi Germany a generation ago. Many pastors submitted, and were silent. Others were not, and paid the price...." (reclaimamerica.org)

STATEMENT OF STEVEN T. MILLER, DIRECTOR, EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, TUESDAY, MAY 14, 2002. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT, WASHINGTON, DC:

MR. MILLER: "Like any other section 501 (c)(3) organization, a church not only jeopardizes its tax-exempt status for participating in a political campaign, it also becomes subject to excise tax under section 4955 on its political expenditures. This excise tax may be imposed in addition to or in lieu of revocation."

"Mr. Miller, is there a statutory or regulatory definition of the word 'substantial' as it relates to the amount of activity a religious organization may engage in?

MR. MILLER: I don't believe there is a - and Bruce can correct me if I am wrong on this. I don't believe there is a statutory rule and probably not in the regulations either. There are revenue rulings, and there is some case law out there. Some of these do not involve religious organizations. Because the substantiality test applies across the board to all section 501 (c)(3) organizations, you can look to those cases as well. There is some guidance out there.

Mr. CRANE: Well, since this term remains undefined, are religious organizations simply supposed to wait until some enforcement action is taken by the IRS to find that line?

Mr. MILLER: Again, if we are talking about lobbying and the substantiality rules, we have not done a lot of enforcement in that area. We do not have information that would indicate that we should be more involved in this area.

Mr. CRANE: Well, could it be that there are so few enforcement actions that - because churches totally refrain from political activity because they are afraid of running afoul of the IRS?

Mr. MILLER: I am not sure how to answer that one. Again, substantiality applies only in the lobbying context, and there is an absolute bar in the political context. So the definition of substantiality would not flow over into political intervention unless your bill became law.

Mr. CRANE: What is the average cost for defending against an IRS enforcement action in court?

Mr. MILLER: That I do not have.

Mr. CRANE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

Mr. LEWIS:...But if you have a minister speaking from the pulpit on Sunday morning, maybe a rabbi from the synagogue or the temple, saying that he had been told by God about somebody, that somebody should be elected, somebody should be defeated, is that political activity?

Mr. MILLER. That would constitute political activity. Again, most of these are based on facts and circumstances. It would be difficult for me to find circumstances in which that wouldn't be found to be a political campaign intervention. But, again, whether we would know about that would really depend on who was in the audience.

Mr. LEWIS: So you wait for someone to file a complaint against the institution or against the minister or against the rabbi or whoever?

Mr. MILLER. Again, as I mentioned, obviously, we do not have reporting from churches, and under section 7611 we cannot go out and survey churches. We cannot do audits unless we have a reasonable belief that there is an exemption or other tax issue out there. So there are some limitations.

Mr. MILLER. We certainly do outreach to whoever comes to us, and we do have a network of individuals from the religious community that we talk to. One person on our advisory committee is, in fact, a representative of the religious community. We do have an outside advisory committee that speaks to us, and we bounce things off of and -

Mr. WELLER: Who is that?

Mr. MILLER: That is Deirdre Dessingue of the Catholic Conference.

...Mr. WELLER: And can the minister say the following from the pulpit and not be in violation of the tax status, that candidate X is pro-life or candidate Y is pro-choice?

Mr. MILLER: That becomes more problematic, Congressman. The pastor, the minister, the rabbi can speak to issues of the day, but to the extent they start tying it to particular candidates and to a particular election, it begins to look more and more like either opposition to a particular candidate or favoring a particular candidate.

STATEMENT OF COLBY M. MAY, DIRECTOR, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW &amp; JUSTICE, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA

Mr. MAY: ...Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for extending to me the invitation to be here today. I am and was Legal Counsel for the Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, New York, which in 1992 had its exemption revoked for a single violation of this portion of the Tax Code. Until 1954, all houses of worship were afforded the full and clear opportunity to act and speak as their conscience and leadership may direct, even in the political area. Today, houses of worship do not, however, enjoy that freedom because of the Johnson amendment which was inserted into the Tax Code in 1954 without a debate or a hearing. Then-Senator Johnson was angry because two Texas charitable organizations had taken a position contrary to him during his then-current primary bid. The law under the Johnson amendment now provides that churches and exempt organizations may engage in an insubstantial amount of lobbying activities, as you have heard from the IRS panel, but they are banned from doing anything that may be regarded as participating or intervening in a political campaign. Now the law is so intrusive and incomprehensible that the IRS has actually taken the position - and I was curious to note that they did not mention this during their testimony, but they have taken the position that there is coded language that may be used which would violate the political prohibition. In its publication, Election Year Issues, the IRS explains that the concerns that an exempt organization may support or oppose a particular candidate without specifically naming the candidate by using code words to substitute for the candidate's name and its message - code words such as conservative or liberal, pro-life or pro-choice or anti-choice, or even Republican or Democrat. Now, making matters worse, the IRS doesn't know whether the intent behind the message matters. Did the organization intend to actually endorse or not? Adding further inscrutability, the IRS has also said the same message can be both permissible for an exempt organization to make if it is an educational or religious message, but it may nevertheless violate the political intervention ban. Now, what a Catch-22. Code language violates the ban, but maybe it doesn't. Intent matters, but it doesn't. And the same message is okay, but it isn't....Since the beginning of the Tax Code, churches and houses of worship have been exempt from income taxes because they provide services and promote the general welfare, saving those costs to the government. That fundamental relationship will not change if you abandon the absolute political intervention ban and replace it with a no substantial part test as you currently have in the lobbying area....Now, I conclude my introductory remarks by simply noting that, whatever this standard is, it certainly isn't applied in a very consistent or even-handed manner....

STATEMENT OF REVEREND BARRY W. LYNN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICANS UNITED FOR SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE

Reverend LYNN: Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Barry Lynn. I serve as the Executive Director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. I am also an ordained Minister in the United Church of Christ, and an attorney, and I have had a long interest in the issues that we are discussing here today....The bills before you would scrap a time-tested system and substitute a reckless experiment in mixing religion with partisan politics. Make no mistake, these bills are not about free speech; instead, they would promote the corruption of the church and the corruption of the political process....Pastors are not gagged, churches are not shuttered by the fear of the IRS. This is a nonsensical caricature by those who are trying to scare religious leaders by misrepresenting current law....So if these proposals are not about free speech, and America's religious leaders already enjoy the right to speak out on the moral issues of the day, then what precisely are these bills about? Let me be blunt. I believe it is simple. There are television preachers and special interest groups who would like to turn America's churches into a powerful political machine. They would also like to undermine the principles of separation of church and State. Lawyers for Pat Robertson are out here, including on this panel, pushing this legislation. Dr. D. James Kennedy, also here today to express support for the bill, has repeatedly said that he believes church-State separation is, in his words, a lie, and that he wants to reclaim America for Christ. If these activists are politically successful, in part by passing these bills, the consequences would be devastating for the Nation's tradition of religious pluralism and genuine religious freedom....

STATEMENT OF D. JAMES KENNEDY, PH.D., PRESIDENT, CORAL RIDGE MINISTRIES, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA

Reverend KENNEDY: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to be here to have an opportunity to speak to you, especially after what I have just been listening to. I hardly recognized the Nation that we are talking about in a previous discussion. It is certainly nothing that I would be in favor of. May we simply remind ourselves of the history of this matter. Up until July 2, 1954, when this Nation and its churches had been active for 334 years with the kind of freedom that this bill would grant, it did not create the kind of monstrosity that we just heard about, nor do I believe it would in the future. What is new and what is radical is this bill, which, as you know, was introduced on the floor on July 2 as Members were leaving for summer by LBJ, by Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was very upset that a couple of anti-Communist groups in Texas had been giving him a very difficult time in the election, and he decided to do what often has been decided to be done by people in power that did not like the things that had been said about them. He decided to silence them, so he added on the floor, without debate, the amendment that took away from churches and ministers what they had enjoyed for 334 years; that is, the right to say whatever they felt their consciences and the Scriptures were teaching them, and that they did not need to be afraid of what the government would do if they said certain things that the government disallowed. I have traveled all through this Nation. I have talked to thousands, over 100,000 ministers on this subject. I have noticed several things. One of them, if you ask any 100 of them what this says, we probably would get almost 100 different answers. It is very confusing. I think that was seen when we heard the experts talk about it earlier today. It is not something that is easily understood, and I have talked to many ministers who would not say anything on any moral issue or any other issue that might be perceived as being unacceptable because they were afraid that the IRS would come down upon them, open a new file on their church, and that they would experience repercussions because of that. Therefore, they have abstained from saying anything. Most people in America today believe that anything that is legal is right, and anything that is illegal by definition is wrong. Therefore, they feel that it is wrong to speak on these issues today, especially if there is any kind of election that is forthcoming in the near future, because they believe that this is illegal. They are not sure what it is that is illegal, because it is, indeed, confusing and obscure, in many aspects. And when you question them about that, it is very clear that they do not know exactly what is or what is not legal for them to say and when they can say it....And, therefore, I think that this unfair and ill-understood concept needs to be abandoned, and we should go back not to some advanced radical new view that somebody might come up with now, but rather we should go back to what the founders of this country and Americans in general for over 300 years believed was the proper thing to do.

STATEMENT OF BRENDA GIRTON-MITCHELL, ASSOCIATE GENERAL SECRETARY FOR PUBLIC POLICY, AND DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON OFFICE, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHURCHES OF CHRIST IN THE USA

Ms. GIRTON-MITCHELL:....We welcomed Dr. Martin Luther King as our keynote speaker to the council in 1957. We sent a youth director by the name of Andrew Young to work with Dr. King, and he later became a Member of this body. We and our members have preached, written, marched, applauded, protested, and even prayed for Congress and for legislation, and have found that this current legal system serves us well....It is against this backdrop of a proud heritage and with a continuing concern for religious liberty that I come to you today to say that while H.R. 2357 and H.R. 2931 are purported to protect the political speech of churches, they are, in fact, unnecessary, they are unwise, and they are unwanted by our member communions of the National Council of Churches and many other faith groups that have been represented today.

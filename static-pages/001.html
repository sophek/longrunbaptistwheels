"Just Mom"

Hello Sisters in Christ!
I can't tell you just how thankful I am to be able to share with you the things that the Lord has shown me from His Word! I am also excited to share with you the many different practical things the Lord has taught me in the last several years that have shaped my ministry as a wife, mother, homemaker and pastor's wife.

You know as well as I do that we are fighting a battle. So few Christian women understand their calling, and it is a burden on my heart to help women understand the blessings and glories of submitting to the Lord's will for their lives. Oh, what a wonderful feeling it is to wake up in the morning, to look around my home, and to know that everything I do in it will be to bless those who live in it! That I have a real purpose, and that I am needed in this home! They try to make you feel needed in the workplace- that they couldn't get along without you - but they can. At my former desk there sits someone who has replaced the position that I left years ago. But I know that in my home, there is no one to replace me. If I don't do the duties that I have, they remain undone.

Being a homemaker is the very fabric of society. The very
stability. Would you call our society stable? I wouldn't either. All of the homemakers have left the home and become business-builders. They are working to put money into someone else's pocket. They put their children into day cares and public schools so they themselves can earn the title of "Working Woman" and fulfill the dream that Hollywood has put into their heads. "I would go crazy at home, what in the world would I do all day?" Some women have said to me. "Dear woman," I think, "Little do you know!" What do I do all day? From the beginning of my day until the end, my time is filled with productivity! When I clean and organize my home, I am producing a place of refreshment. When I kiss little boo boo's and dry little tears I am producing a bond of trust. When I create a special atmosphere in my home I am producing a place of joy and peace. When I sit down just to listen to the events in my husband's day I am producing unity. When I take time to counsel someone in distress I am producing friendship. When friends and family feel welcome in my home I am producing hospitality. When I run all of my errands, set (and sometimes reset!) schedules, cook meals and so many other things, I am producing an efficiently run home. Most of all, at the end of each day I can rejoice in the fact that my Saviour was honored, and that He is pleased with my service.

Please consider this letter:

"I have 3 children and have been driven to work since my first was born. I have thrown myself into it wholeheartedly because I feel like something. I feel good, I feel needed, I feel like I am serving and good will come back to me in the world someday. When I do not work, I feel lost, saddened, like I need to isolate myself because of that. Its not because I am a stay at home mom that I feel less (cause some make you feel that way) I just feel more to myself, my life than just being `mom.'"

How my heart broke as I read these words. How I longed for this woman to understand how needed she really is by her husband and 3 precious children! How much good she could do in her home. I once heard a quote that went something like this: "You can either be a little to many, or you can be the whole world to a few." Unlike the above writer, through Jesus, I am more than happy to be called "just
mom."

What a life is mine! What a joy! What a service. I am called to be what I am. A homemaker.

Keeping Healthy

Mullein
I love herbs! I believe that the Lord gave them to His people so that even the poor could receive the care they need to keep healthy. Many useful and medicinal herbs can be found in your own backyard, or a near by field which is, of course, free. We also buy bulk herbs (MUCH cheaper than pre-packaged in tea or pill form) from health food stores near us. We have also bought bulk herbs online.

Several nights ago I awoke at the sound of my daughters cough, and it sounded like a terrible one. I quickly heated some water, filled a tea ball with mullein. (A tea ball is basically a small round filter that fits in a coffee cup. You can also purchase these online or in
a health food store.) I added a little milk and honey to the cup after I let it steep a while, and brought it to my daughter to drink. Her cough was soothed for the rest of the night, and she slept peacefully until morning. Due to this and several other herbs, to this day I haven't had to give my children prescription antibiotics or even over-the-counter medications for respiratory problems.

Mullein has been used for thousands of years for respiratory problems. It sooths your throat, coughs (by helping to stop muscle spasms), and brings up sticky phlegm. It has always made me a bit sleepy after drinking it, so I usually only take it at night.

(Note: All herbs are powerful and must be used with wisdom! Please discuss them with your healthcare provider before use.)

Raising Up Godly Children
+++++++++++++++++++
Parent, have you trained yourself not to discipline immediately but to wait until your irritation builds into anger? If so, then you have allowed anger to be your inducement to discipline. "But how can I stop being so angry?" you ask. It's simple. Don't wait until it becomes a personal affront to you. Discipline immediately upon the slightest disobedience. When children see you motivated by anger and frustration they assume that your "discipline" is just a personal matter, a competition of interest. The child thinks of you as he would another child that is bullying him around. He is not being made to respect the law and the lawgiver. He believes that you are forcing him to give in to superior power. When you act in anger, your child feels that you are committing a personal transgression against him - violating his rights. You have lost the dignity of your office. As they say, "You are not presidential enough." If your child does not see consistency in the lawgiver, in his mind there is no law at all, just competition for supremacy.

You have taught yourself to be motivated only by anger. And you have taught your child to respond only to anger. Having failed to properly train your child, you have allowed the seeds of self-indulgence to grow to ugly proportions.

Growing in Faith

"When I first came to America thirty-one years ago, I crossed the Atlantic with the captain of a steamer who was one of the most devoted men I ever knew; and when we were off the banks of Newfoundland he said to me, "Mr. Inglis, the last time I crossed here, five weeks ago, one of the most extraordinary things happened that has completely revolutionized the whole of my Christian life. Up to that time I was one of your ordinary Christians. We had a man of God on board, George Mueller, of Bristol. I had been on that bridge for twenty-two hours and never left it. I was startled by someone tapping me on the shoulder. It was George Mueller. "`Captain,' said he, `I have come to tell you that I must be in Quebec on Saturday afternoon.' This was Wednesday. "'It is impossible,'" I said. "'Very well, if your ship can't take me, God will find some other
means of locomotion to take me. I have never broken an engagement in fifty-seven years.' "'I would willingly help you, but how can I? I am helpless.' "'Let us go down to the chart room, and pray,' he said. "I looked at this man and I thought to myself, `What lunatic asylum could the man have come from? I never heard of such a thing.' "Mr. Mueller,' I said, `do you know how dense this fog is?'
"'No,' he replied, `my eye is not on the density of the fog, but on the living God, who controls every circumstance of my life.' "He went down on his knees, and he prayed one of the most simple prayers. I thought to myself, `That would suit a children's class, where the children were not more than eight or nine years of age.' The burden of this prayer was something like this. `O Lord, if it is consistent with Thy will, please remove this fog in five minutes. You know the engagement You made for me in Quebec for Saturday. I believe it is Your will.' "When he had finished, I was going to pray, but he put his hand on my shoulder and told me not to pray. "'First,' he said, `you do not believe God will do it; and, second, I believe He has done it. And there is no need whatever for you to pray about it.' "I looked at him, and George Mueller said this, 'Captain, I have known my Lord for fifty-seven years and there has never been a single day that I have failed to gain an audience with the King. Get up, Captain, and open the door, and you will find the fog is gone.' I got up, and the fog was gone. On Saturday afternoon George Mueller
was in Quebec."

On A Personal Note&
+++++++++++++++++++
Yesterday afternoon I returned from a day long trip to Arkansas. My mom called me a few days before and invited my sister and I and our children to go along with her to visit her aunt who is dying of cancer. She has been given 2 years to live, so is, for the time being, doing well. She is almost 85 and lives by herself by a beautiful large lake surrounded by pine trees so tall that they seem to nearly reach the sky. As a little girl, I would spend part of my summers there. She taught me everything I know about fishing. We would fish in the early mornings when it was still dark until it was so hot and humid we couldn't stand it anymore, and go back late in the afternoon until evening brought millions of mosquitoes to drive us crazy. Then we would go home and clean and scale the fish, then get the neighbors together and have an old fashioned fish fry. I still remember how good those fish tasted! To this day she is still the best fisher-person I know, though she doesn't have the energy to go out too often anymore.

It is amazing to me how one day, just one short day, has rejuvenated me in my work as a homemaker. It was a rest, a break from the day to day duties. What's funny is that I love housework and wouldn't think that I would need a break, but every now and then, I guess I do. We all do. I was almost afraid to leave my many duties in my home, but unsurprisingly, they were still there when I returned, and
none the worse for the delay.

A homemaker is constantly surrounded by her work when she is in her home. A "day off" is non-existent while she is still there. There will still be laundry to wash, clutter to pick up, meals to make with dishes and kitchen to clean up afterward, and on and on. The only times that I can remember a day that I did absolutely nothing in my home is when I wasn't there (or recovering after childbirth). My
husband, Joey, takes our children and I with him to pastor's conferences, and sometimes we will leave to go and see family in different places. Other than that, though I may have a "light day" of housework, I am still on duty.

Being gone for that short time refreshed me. Spending a day doing nothing but fellowshipping with family, and watching my children play and have fun was the perfect little getaway. I loved watching them splash in the lake and make ripples in the water by throwing rocks into it, going on a nature hike to my old special place, catching new bugs, finding the prettiest rocks, and even finding a turtle. We all had fun figuring out how we were all going to sleep in a two bedroom house. Not only was I refreshed, but they were too! My home was cleaned with joy and fervor today as I rushed around while playing holy Christian music tapes on my radio. Everything was put back into order from our trip, and I realized how much I missed my house and duties (and my husband!). Before I left I remember irritably thinking "Is that a DIRTY SOCK on my FLOOR?" Today when I saw the very same offending object, I joyfully and energetically put it in the clothes basket and thought about how much I love my family.

-HOMEMADE BUTTER
Have you ever made butter? It is incredible when eaten on fresh hot bread. This is something you can involve the whole family in. The children will love it! It can be used as a fun science project too. First, get heavy cream, or sometimes called heavy whipping cream (not half and half) from your local grocery store. I buy fresh milk each week from an 80 year old woman who runs a small dairy near me, so I just skim the cream off of the top of the milk. Put the cream in a jar or airtight container and shake, or for a much faster method, put it into your blender on low. The cream will first become whipped cream (you could stop hear and add a little honey to it then eat with fruit or dessert!). Continue to shake (or blend) until the butter separates from the buttermilk. If you are shaking a jar, you will begin to feel the butter thud against the container, and will hear the buttermilk sloshing. Separate the butter from the buttermilk (you can keep the buttermilk for baking, pancakes, etc. Just remember that it is not CULTURED, and will taste much sweeter than store bought buttermilk). Wash the butter in VERY COLD water until the water is clear. If too much buttermilk is left in the butter, it will sour quickly. After the butter is washed, than salt it, a very little at a time. Remember it takes hardly any salt at all to make it perfect! Shape your butter and refrigerate.

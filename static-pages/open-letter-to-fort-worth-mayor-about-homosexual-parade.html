<strong>Dear Betsy Price,</strong>

The Bible teaches Godâ€™s purpose for government:

â€œâ€¦he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evilâ€¦â€ (Romans 13).

In the Bible, â€œevilâ€ includes the filthy sin of sodomy, that brings  disease and the fall of every culture, nation and kingdom that finally  degrades itself to tolerate it:

<strong>Genesis 19:4</strong> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the<strong> men of Sodom</strong>, compassed the house round, both old and youngâ€¦
5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which  came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may<strong>know them.
</strong>7 And [Lot] said, I pray you, brethren, do not <strong>so wickedly</strong>.
9â€¦And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judgeâ€¦

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<strong><strong> </strong></strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<strong>Ezekiel 16:49</strong> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister <strong>Sodom</strong>, <strong>pride</strong>,  fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her  daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
50 And they were haughty, and <strong>committed abomination</strong>â€¦

<strong>Leviticus 20:13 </strong>If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abominationâ€¦

<strong>Jude1:7</strong> Even as <strong>Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them </strong>in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and<strong> going after strange flesh</strong>, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

<strong>Romans 1:26</strong> For this cause God gave them up unto  vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into  that which is against nature:
27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men <strong>working that which is unseemly</strong>, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

It is within theÂ rights of city officials to publicly speak up for  morality. Whether homosexuals should be prosecuted by law is a separate  issue (Thomas Jefferson advocated castration for them). But as mayor,  you could at least remain neutral at such a time as this. Toleration  never has, and never should, mean that every person must â€œapprove ofâ€  and celebrate every sin someone â€œchoosesâ€ to commit! That is not  toleration; that is insanity.

But you are not just remaining neutral about this issue of  homosexuality; you are celebrating it. You are openly endorsing this  wicked, moral act that brings disease and depression to thousands by  participating as a â€œgrand marshalâ€ in their â€œgay prideâ€ parade! What  message does this send to the children of Fort Worth?

Our fathers and mothers warned that the immodesty of the 1920â€™s would  lead to fornication and divorce. It did so. When the so-called â€œsexual  revolutionâ€ exploded, as warned, it led to abortion and disease. And  just as preachers and womenâ€™s clubs predicted, sodomy followed, as it  also soon demanded cultural acceptance. Behind sodomy, is the pedophilia  movement. It is not yet legal or culturally accepted at this time  (praise God). But there are several signs in academic papers, recently  published, that show an increased push for â€œunderstandingâ€ and  â€œtolerationâ€ in this area. If this sin ever becomes â€œlegalized,â€ will  you also ride in a parade with them? Do we decide what is right or moral  merely on the basis of the law? Wasnâ€™t slavery at one time legal?  Obviously, the civil law can be immoral.

Would you ride in a parade withÂ Bible toting, Fundamental Baptists,  if we elected you as our â€œgrand marshalâ€? Would you ride in a parade  that had as its slogan, â€œStraight and Thankfulâ€? Should not children who  choose to live according to the Bible, and nature, feel good about <em>their </em>choices?

Would you ride in a Masculine Pride parade? Many men across the  country do not believe they are getting a fair hearing in many divorce  courts of America. They are feeling victimized. Would you see it as your  duty to make <em>them</em> feel better? They, like some homosexuals,  claim that they are getting persecuted. It could be well argued that  fathers in America are suffering more persecution than homosexuals are  suffering. Would you therefore ride in a parade organized by groups  wanting to give MEN a better voice in family courts, in an attempt to  relieve male frustration?

There are also many groups that advocate Black Pride. They say they  are not racist; they simply want to make black children feel good about  being black. There are also Hispanic Pride organizations. But do not  forget there are also White Pride organizations! I do not endorse any of  these groups, and our church is multi-racial. However, several White  Pride groups also state that they are not racist; and that they simply  want to make white children feel good about being white. Certainly, if  homosexuals can be proud of so gross an act as sodomy, you would not  object to white people <strong>celebrating</strong> being  white,Â wouldÂ you?Â If we can motivate any of these groups to come out and  celebrate their causes, will you ride as â€œgrand marshalâ€ in their  parades? If not, why not? If you will be USED by the homosexual  community to give LEGITIMACY to their cause (i.e. they are currently  celebrating and promoting your participation as a victory), why not be  USED by other groups as well?

If you say that you do not want to participate in a Black or a White  pride parade, to avoid stirring up controversy, and racial strife, then  why are you participating in a homosexual parade? It is a slap in the  face to the Christian community of Fort Worth, and surrounding areas.  Even if you disagree with Christianity and most other religions about  homosexuality, do you have to use your official position to condone such  immorality?

Why not come and stand withÂ us, as we hold signs defending the  TRADITIONAL FAMILY in America? Why donâ€™t you participate with us? We  know of housewives and grandmothers and preachers who will be defending  the traditional family on Oct. 1st. Will you come and stand with these  grandmothers? If not, why not? Why are you on the other side? We are on  the side of what we all know to be true <strong>naturally and Biblically.</strong> Do not the families of your city need you at this time?

ï»¿I have protestedÂ several of these â€œgay prideâ€ events, and I can tell  you that I have never in my life seen such a gross, morally filthy,  gyrating, humping, obscene group of people. The emails that I have  received after such eventsÂ cannot even be repeated in print. They also  show amazing hatred and death threats and wishes for the death of  Christians. If it was just one or two, one might see them as a few bad  apples. But the majority of hundreds of emails have been of such nature.  My question is, how can a lady (any lady, whether Mayor or not),  legitimize such a group of people? They are not a race â€“ but a group of  people who have decided to fornicate with the same sex! The fact that  they CLAIM to be born this way does not make it true. Pedophiles are  also making the same claims. And does being supposedly born with a  certain bent make an action right? I believe most people are naturally  born to see homosexuality as grotesque.

ï»¿And this leads to my final question. Is not homosexuality, in  reality, just another form (though more vile) of fornication  (pre-marital sex?). There is a push for so-called marriage rights. But  most homosexuals choose to live together in fornication, and make no  attempt to â€œmoralizeâ€ their party-life of sexual deviancy. Now, would  you participate in a FORNICATION PARADE of heterosexuals? Would you help  them celebrate premarital sex? If you would not endorse such a group,  why would you endorse homosexual fornication?

Would you endorse a parade that celebrated DRUNK or ALCOHOLIC PRIDE?

In history, the worst Divine judgments have always come to cities  when the officials of the cities orÂ nations added their support to the  sins of the people. It is always the final, filling of the cup, in Godâ€™s  eyes. May the Lord bless you, as you reason about all of this; and may  you do the RIGHT thing. If you will not help us protest this moral decay  of the city,Â  at least remain neutral, and refuse to be <em>used </em>in this manner! Thank you for your time.

ï»¿Sincerely,

Pastor Joey Faust

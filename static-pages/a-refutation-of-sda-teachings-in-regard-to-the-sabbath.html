            A REFUTATION OF SDA TEACHINGS IN REGARD TO THE SABBATH

"I saw that the Sabbath would never be done away..." (Ellen G. White, "Spiritual Gifts," Vol.I, pg.113)

"The pope has changed the day of rest from the seventh to the first day." (Ellen G. White, "Early Writings")

Matthew 24:20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:

Should we keep the SEVENTH DAY sabbath? No. But how do we understand Matthew 24:20? Compared with Luke 21, we see that, at this time, Jerusalem will be attacked. Jewish believers must escape quickly. Yet, the gates will most likely be shut and everything will be shut down due to sabbath-keeping Jews! Israel is in blindness and still tries to obey the cermonial aspects of the Mosaic Law. It will be hard to try to escape on the sabbath day. It would also be hard to escape in winter and to escape with children! Yet, no one makes "having children" a set law for all Christians (unmarried, etc.). This is not a list of commands, but a list of problems that escaping believers may be hindered by in Jerusalem. Matthew 24:20 cannot be read as a commandment for NT Christians to obey the 7thday, sabbath commandment. It is written to people who will be in JERUSALEM at that time. Jerusalem will be obeying the sabbath command.

Colossians 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:

If a person desires to not work on Saturday unto God, that is fine; God accepts it. Yet, if he tries to put this as a law on other believers, he is seen as "weak in the faith" at best, or a "Judaizer" at worst:

Romans 14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

It would be truly hard to believe that Col.2 and Rom.14 are not addressing this most important question of the 7th day sabbath command! It would surely have been a contention at the time, especially among Jewish believers. It would have been much like circumcision.

But what of this objection (first put forth by the so-called "inspired" prophetess Ellen White) that "sabbath days" refers to special days other than the weekly sabbath?

We can compare Scripture usage with Scripture usage to see that this is a fabrication. It is a private interpretation:

Exodus 31:13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you

Notice "sabbaths" (plural), while "it" is singular:

Matthew 12:5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? 10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. 11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

Here the Jews, as well as Christ Himself, refer to the weekly sabbath in plural and singular form. Notice some more examples of the Holy Spirit interpreting Col.2:16:

Luke 4:31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? 5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. 9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?

Acts 17:2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

Seventh Day Adventists quote Acts 17:2 as a "proof text" for their view. But when they come to the same wording in Colossians 2:16, they will not receive the plain testimony of the Holy Ghost! Christians often witness on saturday, just as paul does here, to lost Jews, who gathered at that time. Colossians 2:16 is a command to "let no man judge" in regard to the sabbath day. In 59 usages of the word or phrase it means the weekly sabbath. Yet, Adventists insist without any evidence that it means something different in Col.2! The sabbath day was only a "shadow" of the future Millennial Rest (Heb.4), just like the Old Testament sacrificial lambs were a shadow of Christ.

It is true that no jot or tittle of the Law will pass away until God ordains it so. Yet, that does not mean it is not fulfiled and changed by the Great Law Giver:

Hebrews 7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

The "Law" has been fulfilled and changed by the NT. Animal sacrifices, feast days, sabbath days, etc. are not spiritually binding.

Leviticus 23:27-32 shows a holy "sabbath" day. The day of atonement was so holy that one was put to death for working on it. Yet all sabbatarians believe this punishment has "passed away." Adventists often claim that the 7th day is "holy" and that this means it can never be changed. But the holy vessels, holy ark, holy water, holy ointment, etc., have all passed away in the NT age; so has the holy 7th day sabbath.

The weekly sabbath is given as the chief of ceremonial convocations in Lev.23:1-44. It is thus joined with the other "ceremonies" that have likewise passed away. We have "sabbaths" in the 7th day, the 7th month, the 7th year (Lev.25) and the year of jubilee. It is unreasonable to make the 7th "day" binding, while ignoring the remainder of the whole scale!

If the sabbath is binding, then it must be obeyed properly. Where is the evidence that we are free to change these specifics if it is indeed binding?:

Exodus 35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

Numbers 15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

Sabbatarians assume that our calendar is correct and that our Saturday is indeed the "7th day." In going around the earth one way to witness in obedience to Christ, we lose a day; and we gain another going the other way. Where then is the 7th day?:

"Let two Adventists start from Chicago, one going east, the other west around the earth. Each keeps carefully the seventh day as teh sun sets. When they meet again at Chicago they will be two days apart! One will be keeping Sunday and the other Friday...What endless and needless difficulties people get themselves into trying to keep a law which was only designed for Jews in a limited locality." (Canright, 1889)

Historic Quotes on the Sabbath Question

The dates of the following quotes prove that the Constantine did not cause Christians to change the day of worship. The day of public assmebly had been changed since New Testament times:

"They (Jewish Christians) also observe the Sabbath, and other discipline of the Jews, just like them; but on the other hand, they also celebrate the Lord's Days very much like us in commemoration of his resurrection."(Eusebius, A.D.324)

"We solemnize the day after Saturday in contradiction to those who call this day their sabbath."(Tertullian, A.D. 200)

"On one day, the first of the week, we assemble ourselves together." (Bardesanes, A.D. 180)

"But Sunday is the day on which we hold our common assembly, because Jesus Christ, our Savoir, on the same day rose from the dead." (Justin Martyr, A.D. 140)

"We keep the eighth day with joyfulness, the day also on which Jesus rose again..." (Barnabas, A.D. 120)

Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

Acts 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. (A.D. 60)

"Sunday" (the Lord's Day) is not a Roman Catholic idea. The fact that the RC uses this day is no different than the fact that they also hold to the Trinity. The RCC is deceived and devilish, but it is not wrong in everything.

Notice that Scripture also gives the same set that Paul uses in Col.2, elsewhere:

1 Chronicles 23:30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; 31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:

Colossians 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:

The sabbaths in 1 Chronicles 23 are the weekly sabbaths; all agree. We have weekly, monthly and yearly all given. (See also 2 Chronicles 2:4, 8:13, 31:3, Nehemiah10:13, Ezekiel 45:17, Hosea 2:11)

"The old seventh-day Sabbath is abolished and done away." (Bunyan)

"...that God's sabbath was not enjoined on Adam, or ever kept by him, seems certain since God's seventh day was Adam's first)..." ("THE SABBATH &amp; THE LORD'S DAY," By D.M. Panton)

The Authorized Version: The Internally Consistent, Infallible Bible You Can Study!

The fact that one can handle an infallible, inerrant Bible in one's hands to read, study and believe should rejoice the heart of every person who calls himself a Christian. Yet, this truth is not received with joy by many saints; instead it is mocked and rejected as it inflames the passion of many Christian leaders. Should this really surprise anyone? Really it shouldn't. One only has to reflect upon the way Christ Himself (the Word) was treated when He walked upon the religious scene in His day. Think upon how the "scribes" responded to the good news of His subsequent resurrection. Even the very disciples themselves (such as Thomas) found it difficult to believe at first.

A Call To Christian Leaders

"Belief" is of the will, and the will can be wrongly influenced by the passions and desires. How many Christians will not come to the knowledge of the evils involved in Roman Catholicism simply because they will lose "ministry opportunities" on such large television networks as TBN, etc.? The Lord knows how many, and He will manifest that information really soon. (1Cor.4:5) Likewise, how many will not come to the knowledge of King James Onlyism simply because they will lose "ministry opportunities" with large publishers who have worldwide distribution?

Many Christians would have a hard time deceiving themselves if the choice was between embracing the truth of a certain doctrine (such as the evils of eastern meditation) and keeping their present jobs. Although many, no doubt, would compromise in self-deception and "believe" that there is nothing wrong with Yoga or chanting because it is financially convenient to do so, there are many other Christians that would have a hard time deceiving their consciences. On the other hand, it is very easy to deceive the conscience when the compromise allows one to "further the Gospel". "If I stood for that doctrine I would lose the open door that the Lord has set before me to be published and preach to all the world." Ouch! The path to Christian discipleship often appears hard. It is easy to judge others but extremely hard to judge ourselves. Yet, the walk of faith tells us that God is able to open doors that "sight" can't always see. What looks like captivity for the Word is often the opportunity to preach to all of Caesar's household! (Phil.4:22, 2Tim.2:9)

Self-deception is a powerful force. (Jms.1:22) It would pay for every teacher of the Word to silence all the hypothetical, calculated, assumed objections to a doctrine for a moment (remember the Pharisees and the Sadducees thought they were being guided by Scripture and reason. - John 7:52, Mk.12:18,19) and ask oneself, "What would I have to lose if I assented to this doctrine and confessed it publicly before men?" If you find in answering that you would lose much money, esteem or "ministry opportunity", I would prayerfully check to see if what I thought was a reasonable ground for rejecting a doctrine was not rather a carnal reasoning that has been dominated and bossed around by the contentious passion that routinely threatens every man.

Reliable Or Infallible?

The Written Word has been "resurrected" in the "flesh" in this last age. It can be held, touched, read and studied. It was "crucified" by Rome. Copies were mutilated. Errors crept in. The originals were lost. To this all agree. If you doubt it pick up any book that pretends to "defend" the faith and the "Bible". Read about the assumed errors in Kings and Chronicles. See how these mighty warriors of truth solve the apparent problems. They can handle the blind men, Resurrection morning and a truckload of other apparent discrepancies. Yet, when these "conservatives" get a hold of Kings (or any other verse that disagrees with their theology) they are quick to tell the reader that only the originals were infallible and without error. They are quick to tell the reader that no translation or copy can be perfect and that a "few" errors have crept in over time.

Do they seek to prove this proposition? No. You are to assume it is infallible, inerrant truth. You are to likewise embrace their theory of "sloppy, semi-preservation through the multitude of copies" and accept it as a "Gospel-fact". It is not grounded in any Scripture. It is not grounded in any "type". It is simply the norm and you must accept it to gain entrance into their club.

"But that can't be! Dr. So and So doesn't believe that. And I just got a great book on 'apologetics'; the author believes in the inspiration of the Bible. He answers the 'contradictions' and professes to believe in an infallible, inerrant Word."

You must learn to listen and read closer. The trick will always be in the "words". (2Tim.1:13) These books answer a dozen or so "discrepancies" and leave the rest to "scribal error". You are to boldly believe that the Almighty God had the power and determination to keep the errors "few" and "insignificant"; yet to believe that this same God would give His saints a Bible without one single error is considered the height of absurdity. [As already noted, the issue really revolves around money, esteem, peer acceptance and power. If the majority believed they have long possessed a perfect Bible, the Protestant, Evangelical Priesthood would go bankrupt.]

Notice they never tell you which "Bible" is perfect. "Bible" (to them) is one of those loosey-goosey words. It doesn't mean anything you can hold in your hand and read. It either refers to a set of manuscripts that used to be here at one time or it refers to a verse here, a verse there, a word here, a word there, scattered all over a multitude of copies. In other words, you cannot read this "Bible".

Now look closer in these books at the phrases "infallible Bible", etc. Notice they only refer it to the "original manuscripts" that are all presently lost! Yet when they come to something you can actually read today, something you can place on your desk and study, watch the change in wording. It is subtle. (Gen.3:1) The word "infallible" is smoothly reduced to "reliable". Notice the difference between the meaning of these words from Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary:

"RELIABLE suggests consistent dependability of judgment, character, performance or result...INFALLIBLE suggests the complete absence of error, breakdown or poor performance."

In other words, God either cannot or chooses not to give His saints an infallible Bible with which they may "check" the scribes and defend themselves (and their children) against their "sell-outs" and compromises. (Acts 17:11) All (it is hoped) admit that the early churches had infallible Scriptures. The only question is, since the revival of light out of the Dark Ages, (where much remains hidden from present view) do saints now have infallible Scripture?

This whole modern movement of subjective, "butter-knife" apologetics responds to the proposition of a "perfect Bible in the flesh" the way the early scribes responded to the Perfect Word in the flesh 2000 years ago. On the other hand, many of the "common people" hear it gladly:

John 7:
46 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

Mark 12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

Here it is clear. The truth of a perfect Bible "in the flesh" will be rejected for the same reason the Perfect Christ "in the flesh" was rejected by early Gnostic Christians. (1Jn.1:1) It immediately makes the issue of "final authority" objective. The "proof" that the Bible is now "among the people" will be mocked and ridiculed the same way "truth" was ridiculed at the time of Christ. It will be "too far out" to be believed by the sophisticated and educated:

1 Corinthians 1:20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

"The King James Bible is perfect? What will they think of next?" Yes, we understand your dilemma. Things like Christ coming back really soon, an Antichrist over in Rome, the Virgin Birth, etc. God has always confounded the "wise" and made them roll their eyes in disgusted, sarcastic mockery. (John 6:66) The call of wisdom often seems to adorn its children in strange and peculiar dress before the closed eyes of unbelief.

They tell us copyist errors have surfaced in Kings and Chronicles. They tells us a multitude of verses throughout the Bible "should actually read $*&^%$ in the originals." What do we do? Do we "leave Jerusalem" with the infallible Word crucified by Roman hands? (Lk.24:25-33) Do we attempt to sort through the contradictory, endless maze by singing the hit song, "whoever is the most degreed, tell us how the verses read"? God forbid! You can go chase down the broadest phylacteries. (Mtt.23:5) We have too much work to do, too much to study to get involved with playing such a subjective game. If you desire to prove or deny something, you will do it with a King James Bible or "thou speaketh to us in the air".(1Cor.14:9) We believe and confess the truth that the Bible is "revived" in a purified form of the universal language of end times; it is inerrant and infallible and it will not go away. It will not let you sleep. King James Onlyism will continue to grow in such popularity among the "common people" that your ministry will be forced again and again to make "financially unprofitable" statements upon the issue. Wake up saints of God! Break the unholy priesthood and read for yourself!

Scribes will continue to use their flowery words to adorn their dead "bible". Yet, some have risen up early and are sure they have seen the truth of the "revived Word". To most Christian leaders it seems as an "idle tale". (Lk.24:11) Every "doubting Thomas" is therefore invited to ponder the following observations.

1. The Bible has been resurrected to perfection in the Authorized Version.

Amen it has! Are you happy about it? Christ promised that His "words" would not pass away. (Lk.21:33) Does this mean that He would allow a "few scribal errors" to creep in and stay? Can you find the errors? If you can are you saying that you know of another "Bible" that is perfect and infallible and has all the errors corrected? We would like to behold the evidence for it and compare it to the AV. If the errors are "few" and may be "easily discerned" then why haven't you fixed them and published a real, infallible, perfect Bible in English? Why not admit that as long as the public keeps settling for "reliable" people can keep making money off of different or improved "versions".

Based upon numerous Biblical examples (in any copy or version) one can see that God has always preserved through resurrection. How does God preserve every hair on a believer's head? Is it not a promise? (Lk.21:18) Yet, will not many believers die? (Lk.21:16) Obviously they will "resurrect" like the WORD Himself. Out of darkness God brought forth light and truth. He, at the same time, placed the Bible where His seeking people can get to it. He used a king to "authorize" in writing the translation of His Word, just like He used king Cyrus to "authorize" the "resurrection" of Jerusalem and the temple. King James no more translated the Bible than Cyrus rebuilt Jerusalem or laid the foundation of the temple. (Ezra 1:1,2)

Moses had the words of God on tables of stone. (Ex.31:18) He broke them. (Ex.32:19) Would the Israelites have to settle for "cracked tablets"? Would they have to piece it all back together and accept a few numbers out of place? No, God gave them again! (Ex.34:1) The same thing happens to the "words of God" in Jeremiah 36:23, 32. They are destroyed and then "revived". God can do it. He shows that He chooses to do it. He is the same God today that He was then! (Heb.13:8) Let the manuscripts be lost. Let them be mutilated. Let them be corrupted. Let errors creep in. Yet, whether you like it or not, whether it hurts your educated feelings or not, whether you "approve" or not, the Perfect Written Word lives again!

The infallible Written Word of God can be found again in times of revival:

2 Kings 22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

2. The evidence or proof of a perfect copy or version today would be the same type of evidence that is used to prove the "Christian Bible" in the first place.

When one picks up any book that attempts to "defend the faith" today, one finds one main proof offered for the supernatural origin of the "Bible" (as opposed to the Koran and other religious writings). It is the "continuity" or "irrefutable, internal evidence". Dave Hunt in his book In Defense of the Faith (Harvest House Pub.) agrees with McDowell and other apologists in writing:

"This continuity and agreement throughout the Bible is one of the most powerful arguments that it is the Word of God."

Besides this continuity, fulfilled prophecy and the subjective element of "fruit" in the lives of so many individuals are two more arguments offered to prove the "Bible". Certainly, if "fruit" proves the Christian "Bible" is true above other religious writings of the world, then "fruit' would prove the KJV above the NAS, the RV, the NIV, the ASV and any other copy or version. Simply look at the state of Christianity since the KJV was rejected in the mainstream! Any objection to the contrary could likewise be used against Christianity in general. But let us move on to the "internal consistency" argument, since it is usually listed first in apologetic books.

It follows that if God desired to place His Words in the universal language of end times, such a "version" would contain this supernatural "continuity" over and above all other copies, translations or versions. The King James Bible alone bears this mark of miraculous internal consistency. The only reason it is not investigated using the same grid of truth that is used to establish the "Bible" in the first place, is because Christian scholars in the majority are taught one thing from the very moment they enter seminary until the day they leave: There is no perfect Bible since the originals have perished; no copy, version or translation is infallible. Since they do not believe in the possibility of the King James Version being miraculously delivered from God, it is not even examined for any miraculous internal continuity.

Nevertheless, the same scholars that would mock the idea of the King James Bible being given by God through men, would at the same time preach that there is a perfect, locked Bible "canon" of 66 Books and that God chose to preserve the "really important stuff" through historic hands of man to a high point of 97% accuracy. [96-99% are numbers they like to throw around to comfort the discouraged Christian now that he is told that he can't read his "Bible" without a "textual guide".] If a man can believe that God is willing and able to do the above, it does not seem too great a "step" to believe in another 3% where there is evidence calling one to it! (Unless, of course, the confession of 3% more would close doors of opportunity.) The same arguments one uses to argue the preservation of the "really significant stuff" (as well as the 66 Books of the Bible Canon) with a Catholic or unbeliever will be the same arguments that likewise prove the KJV to be miraculously ordained and delivered through the instrumentality of man. In fact, practically any argument used to prove Christianity can also at the same time prove the Authorized Version. Likewise any objection against the Authorized Version is at the same time an objection against Christianity. Worldly thinking is worldly thinking:

"They have always tried to place one version or copy above another. The Church Fathers believed in the Septuagint and some Catholics believed in the Vulgate, etc. Why don't these KJV Onlyists see that all Bible versions are reliable?"

Such is the emotional tattling from the cesspool of "unbelief". Is Christianity the only religion that is absolutely true? Of course. But how will "unbelief" respond to such an assertion?

"People are always trying to place one religion above others as the only way. Christianity Onlyism makes me sick. The Jews as well as the Muslims are a prime example. Why don't these people see that all religions are equally reliable as a means to salvation? There isn't just one way."

Any arguments put forth to answer the above objection may also be written down to likewise answer the "amazed" (1 Pet.3:6) objections to the KJV as well.

Miraculous Continuity in the Authorized Version

The following example of "spirit and soul" is just one case out of many that show the amazing internal consistency of the KJV. It will at once be seen by all who are honest, that the Translators could not have possibly foreseen these doctrinal "connections". Nevertheless, unbelief will mock these "connections" in the same way unbelief will mock any supposed "connection" between Paradise Lost in Genesis and Paradise Regained in the Revelation. He that chooses to deny the hand of God in the internal consistency of the KJV, has laid the ground to deny any internal consistency in the whole "Bible" to begin with.

Others will protest on the basis that affirming such a miraculous continuity is implying that the KJV Translators were "inspired". We will be reminded that the Translators themselves confessed they were not. In the first place, there is no evidence that Luke knew he was "inspired" when he wrote Acts to Theophilus. (Acts 1:1) Secondly, the only thing put forth by KJV Onlyism is that God's Providence and Sovereignty insured that the KJV would come out perfect in its final form. All (it is hoped) would agree that God controls all things. (Prov.21:1) The only question is whether God chose to insure the
KJV's perfection. God is able to make something perfect. Right? Why would God be limited to making things "reliable"? God likes details. (Have a sober Bible study on the Book of Exodus if you doubt such a thing!) There is not a man alive that can put forth a rational argument for why God in His power and will could not have made sure the KJV came out perfect in every word or letter. You may call this a big religious word to frighten the feeble-minded. Yet, we will call it God preserving His Word to perfection through man. But let us go forward with the evidence of "supernatural continuity" in the KJV.

The KJV immediately shines above other "versions" in the way it consistently weaves beautiful pictures through the use of gender specifications. By describing various things as either "male" or "female" much truth is illustrated and enriched. Let us note a few examples in the KJV as compared to the NIV. [One may substitute any "bible" for the NIV to see that these other "bibles" fail to make the "connections".]:

Isaiah 13:10 KJV For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

ISA 13:10 NIV The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.

As can be seen from the sample in Isaiah, other "bibles" fail to give a gender for the sun or moon. The KJV consistently from Genesis to Revelation gives the sun as a "he" and the moon as a "she". It never misses a lick. It does the same with other dualism's such as the Heaven and the Earth, etc.

"Who cares? What's the difference?" To start with, beautiful pictures have been removed. Pictures that would not only teach much truth about the relationship between the objects specified, but would in turn teach much truth about the proper roles and functions of husband and wife, which would, as well, show forth much truth concerning Christ and the Church.

The "sun" is said to be a "he". The "moon" is a "she". The moon receives her light from the sun. She has no light of her own. Science has since proven the fact and I am sure there are few that doubt it. The Bible shows that the moon has her place of authority and rule. (Gen.1:16) Yet, she receives from her husband and "helps" him by shining forth his light in her place. This is a beautiful picture of Christ and His Church. The local church is to receive all her "light" from Christ who is the "head". Christ as He speaks through His Word is the authority for the Church. Christians are to spread His light, His truth, His words instead of speaking things from their own independent hearts, seeking their own glory. By erasing the words "he and "she" with heaven and the earth, and the sun and the moon, the role and authority of the husband in the marriage is erased. Indeed, one may teach the doctrines to young couples without the colorful, vivid analogies. Yet, one would rob students of an illustration sanctioned by the Word of God.

One may just as easily teach the "doctrine" of stewardship on the basis of the N.T. statement that Christians are "stewards". (1Pet.4:10) Yet, would any dare say that because the teaching of stewardship is Biblically present that the parables of the Pounds and Talents (Lk.19, Mtt.25) serve no purpose and may therefore be left out of the Bible? This whole idea that things can be left out of the Word because they are "found elsewhere" is either rebellion or ignorance. It certainly has no place on the lips of mature Christians. God repeats things to show that things are "established" and will "shortly come to pass". (Gen.41:32) Satan hates the fact and attempts to first erase all repetitions of truth until carnal Christians allow him to erase the very last foundations. [The first, devilish step in the reduction of doctrinal truth involves the erasure of the ability to "prove" doctrine effectively. For example see the removal of the one clear statement on the Triune Godhead in 1John 5:7. I challenge any man to find one verse that proves God is three yet one besides that one.]

The Devilish Unisex Movement

The significant picture of male and female does not stop with "heaven and earth" and the "sun and the moon", it continues its beautiful dance throughout the KJV as it colors various things such as love, charity, patience, wisdom, iniquity, sin, the world, etc. (John 15:19, Gen.4:7, 1Cor.13:5, Rom.13:10, Job 5:16, Jms.1:4) The KJV weaves together a whole dramatic cast of characters through this use of genders. Of course, in this "gender-neutral", hermaphroditical age, it is not hard to see why God's holy specifying of certain things as either "male" or "female" has been dropped. The worldly Spirit of
Antichrist will continue to deny or confuse the individual, God-given distinctions between male and female. Evil hates the fact that these distinctions are so clearly taught and vividly illustrated in pictorial form throughout the Authorized Version.

In fact, the whole diabolical, "gender-neutral", "unisex" scheme of Satan will become increasingly manifest as we continue. There is more behind it besides the breaking up of the order and foundation of the traditional home. One will find that the realm of feelings and emotions is pictured in the KJV as "female" and the realm of intellect and discernment is pictured as "male". Satan seeks to make the Bride of Christ follow emotion and experience instead of His Word. In order to accomplish this goal he seeks to merge the realm of reason with the realm of emotion and intuition, making them "equal" authorities in the lives of believers. The whole "unisex" movement (in all its subtle branches) is only an outward form of a far more wicked, underlying reversal of God's created, ordained order. Underneath it all is a burning hatred and contempt for the authority of the intellect in man. (2Thess.3:2) Just as the spirit of Antichrist despises the traditional, male leadership in the "family", it also despises the headship that reason has been traditionally given in Western society. It must seek to replace this inward principle by bringing in an intuitive, Eastern mindset of "if it feels good do it". [With the Christian the same idea is cloaked in religious words.] As this inward reversal becomes engrained throughout society, the outward reversals naturally follow in homes and churches as people "feel" like reversing every aspect of God's ordained order.

It is now time to formally meet another married "couple" revealed only in the KJV.

The Spirit and Soul of the KJV

The KJV, unlike any other "bible" places the spirit and soul of man in a husband/wife relationship. Just as the wife is under the authority of the man (with her own place, special gifts and purpose) so does God order the soul to be under the authority of the spirit. And, just as the moon receives her light from the sun, so is the soul to receive her guidance from the spirit. Notice that the "soul" is a "she" in the KJV:

Psalm 34: KJV
1 A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in
my mouth.
2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.

PS 34:2 NIV My soul will boast in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.

Other so-called "bibles" immediately break the chain of truth. Notice that "spirit" (in all its various aspects) is always "male" in the KJV:

1 Peter 3:4 KJV But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

1Peter 3:4 NIV Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.

Note the gender-neutral "inner self" instead of the hidden "man".

Ephesians KJV
3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

Eph. (NIV)
3:16 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
4:23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds;

Only the KJV will paint whole pictures displaying miraculous continuity. One can establish from a KJV that the soul is "female" in type, and that the spirit is "male" in type. Therefore as the wife is under the authority of the husband in a godly, proper marriage, so should the soul be under the authority of the spirit. And just as the wife receives from the husband in order to bear fruit (as the earth receives rain from the sky, and the moon receives light from the sun) so does the soul depend upon the spirit for her life and health. This relationship of spirit and soul is missing in every other "bible". It is only found in the KJV. But to what do these words "soul" and "spirit" refer?

Although the word "soul" is sometimes used to refer to the life or entire self of man, (the same way that "hell" is often used to refer to the whole inner region of the earth which included Paradise) in other places in the Bible the soul is the realm of the mind that has to do with feelings, affections, desires, passions, lusts, and emotions. The spirit is the realm of the mind that has to do with intellect, reason, discernment, etc. By thinking angry thoughts in the "spirit", the emotions will soon respond with angry "feelings". On the other hand, by reflecting upon God and His goodness, the soul will soon respond with a holy boast in the Lord! (Ps.34:2, Lk.1:46,47) The effect the spirit can have on the soul (and her emotions) is very similar to the effect that our will can have on our outward body itself. We can control our bodily health to a very high degree by making wise choices. Yet, this control is limited. It is the same with the soul's emotions and desires.

The Biblical meanings of both "soul" and "spirit" (which can be so easily gleaned by a KJV and a concordance) have been largely overlooked throughout Christendom. Yet, there are some who could not fail to notice in their studies that the "soul" deals with the emotions and desires, while the "spirit" deals with rational thinking:

"The spirit is the seat of the intellectual being...the soul is the seat of the man's emotional nature...It is by the spirit man knows; it is the spirit that reasons. It is the spirit that receives instruction from God...it is the spirit that weighs evidence..." H.A. Ironside, Death and Afterwards

"We shall find in every case that intelligence and judgment belong to the spirit; the affections, desires. appetites, etc., to the soul...Another use of the word, which also we have in English, for the prevailing temper or disposition, as a 'meek and quiet spirit,' a 'spirit of pride,' etc., seems derived from the fact of the spirit being in man the higher part, and the rightful governor of the man...I repeat, then, without fear of successful opposition, that the spirit is in Scripture identified with the mind, the soul is the seat of the affections..."
F.W. Grant, Facts and Theories

"As the soul is the seat of man's emotions, desires and affections, the spirit is the seat of his intelligence and judgment." Cornelius R. Stam, Man, His Nature And Destiny



Now for the rest of you that chose to take the intellect and rational thinking out of the spirit and place it in the soul, and then turn around and tell us that the spirit is the realm of our religion, we place before you a sample of the spectacle that your mistake has helped create: Entire churches barking like dogs and oinking like pigs in the name of Jesus! (i.e. the Pensacola "revival"). [If you don't believe it ask a charismatic what the "spirit" in man is and see if he says the realm of intellectual thinking!]

Completing the Picture

With this backdrop painted by the KJV, other Scriptures shine:

Heb. 4:12 KJV For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow....

In Hebrews 4:12 the soul and spirit are obviously not the same as many (somehow) imagine. They can be split and divided. Yet, notice something else that many miss. Right after "soul and spirit" the verse says "joints and marrow". If one was to line these couples up, one would see that "joints" goes with the "soul" and "marrow" goes with the "spirit".

Now before even beginning the search through Scripture to properly connect this lead, one can already foresee some pictorial truths implied. The soul (as female, Ps.34:2) is also pictured as joints or bones:

Genesis 2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

The spirit, on the other hand, is like the marrow that moistens the bones. Marrow is the health of the bones:

Job 21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.

Therefore, one can immediately see that if one's thinking is not healthy, one's emotions and affections will not be healthy. As bones without healthy marrow "dry up", so will the feelings of the soul harden without the proper support and guidance of healthy thoughts. It is crucial therefore, that one's spirit be "lit" by the light of the Word. This way it may properly lead and guide the soul into healthy desires:

Psalm 18:28 KJV For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.

Proverbs 20:27 KJV The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.

Needless to say, the NIV botches the whole thing:

PR 20:27 NIV The lamp of the LORD searches the spirit of a man; it searches out his inmost being.

With all this one can see why the spirit has been described as male and the soul as female in the KJV. The spirit, enlightened by God's Word, is to lead and guide the soul. When the soul is properly lead, it can be a beautiful help-meet to magnify God and influence us to healthy actions.

The bones depend upon the marrow, the moon depends upon the sun, and the affections of the soul depend upon the guidance of the intellect found in the spirit. A healthy emotional life depends upon a healthy spiritual life. Yet, just as Eve ruled Adam, so do many allow their emotions to cloud their judgment. They walk with their emotions in charge instead of their reason enlightened and strengthened by God's Word, through the Holy Ghost:

Ephesians 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

The gender specifications of the KJV are the key that make all these other connections throughout the Bible fit in place. It enriches their meaning:

Psalm 63:5 KJV My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

The "soul" is satisfied with "marrow". If it would have said "spirit" or if it would have left out "marrow" the picture would not have worked. Yet, the picture connects the other way as well:

Proverbs 17:22 KJV A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.

A "spirit" that is weak in truth will harden the desires in regard to holy things. (Eph.3:16,17) If the sun (pictured as a male) does not shine brightly, then the moon will likewise be dark. If the sky does not give rain, then the earth (female) will be barren and the ground will begin to dry up and crack. Likewise Christians lose joy and holy affections in their soul when they do not exercise and strengthen the spirit through prayer, thoughtful study and holy fellowship with other spiritual believers.

When the soul, as the realm of our desires, urges us to sin, we must deny her as Jesus denied Peter (Mtt.16:23) and Adam should have denied Eve. (Gen.3:6). This will usually involve much suffering. An unruly desire of the soul, when first denied, can often become a "pain":

Proverbs 21:19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.

To avoid the trouble, many choose to allow the passions to bend the realm of reason. The soul pretends to go along with the spirit, yet all along in her feigned submission she has the spirit by the ear! Perhaps your soulish passion has you by the ear in regard to King James Onlyism and it would be "painful" to look any closer. If you would really love your "soul" then deny her and take that closer look. (Prov.19:8)

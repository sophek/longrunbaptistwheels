            "Louisiana House Committee: Darwin's Ideology Is Racist - Baton Rouge, La. - Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, supported racist ideologies that Louisiana's Legislature should reject, a state House committee decided Tuesday in a resolution educators said would open the state to ridicule. Rep. Sharon Broome, D-Baton Rouge, said the resolution would shine a light on racism...Broome denied having ulterior motives, stressing the resolution was simply anti-racism...'The House Education Committee approved 9-5 the resolution that says the Legislature does 'reject the core concepts of Darwinist ideology that certain races and classes of humans are inherently superior to others and does hereby condemn the extent to which these philosophies have been used to justify and approve racist practices.' The resolution moves next to the full House for debate...The resolution says Adolf Hitler exploited the racist views of Darwin and those influenced by Darwin to justify the extermination of millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Joseph Graves, a professor of African-American studies and evolutionary biology at Arizona State University, said Broome was miscommunicating history. Graves described Darwin as an abolitionist who didn't express racist views. 'If we look at the historical balance, Charles Darwin is one of the good guys, not one of the bad guys,' Graves said. Broome read specific passages from Darwin's books 'On the Origin of Species' and 'The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex' which referred to 'civilized races of man' exterminating and replacing 'the savage races.' Graves said Broome took the statements out of context..." (May 1, 2001)

Comments: I think this is great! It is almost funny to read the reply of "professor Graves" as he struggles to hold his allegiance to evolution before his peers. I suggested in past Kingdom Alerts that this would be a good way to argue against evolution in the media. I am glad others had the same idea. In this politically correct world (which, in its mad desire to combat the sin of racism, often actually encourages it) the lie of evolution should die in a heartbeat! But modern man loves his pet evolution theory.

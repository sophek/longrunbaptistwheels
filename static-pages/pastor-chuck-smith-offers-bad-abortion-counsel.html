What is sadly interesting is that Pastor Smithâ€™s proof-text was the woman caught in adultery, where the Lord tells her He doesnâ€™t â€œcondemnâ€ her. In that same passage, Jesus tells the woman that her adultery was SIN: go and SIN no more. The non-condemnation refers to giving her the death penalty â€“ not justifying her sin! The death penalty was a civil law for the Theocracy of Israel, and Israel had been enslaved and was no longer functioning as its own nation. Secondly, though it does not say specifically, I am sure Jesus had seen repentance in the woman, for we are told continually that Jesus knows the hearts of people. What we must ask is whether or not Jesus BEFORE the adultery would have counseled the woman to commit the sin, by telling her that she would not be condemned.

By using words like fetus (and even abortion), a culture of death is gradually accepted, even among Christians. And the response will always be, regardless of how far it goes, that we need to be reasonable and have common sense, and that we should not be Pharisees, etc. May Brother Smith awaken.

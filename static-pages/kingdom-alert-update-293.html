FROM THE EDITOR
***********************

Greetings in Jesus!

There has been a longer delay than usual in sending out the Kingdom Alert due to the passing away of my father-in-law. He was recovering from heart surgery, and the drugs they had placed him on are known for causing strokes. We drove to Denver to the hospital, and then to Nevada for the funeral. We praise the Lord for preserving us on the road these past few weeks. Las Vegas is indeed "sin city." There is open pornography everywhere (on billboards, on cabs, in giant videos on the side of buildings, etc.). How much longer can this city escape God's judgment? Surely it must follow next in line after New Orleans, etc. We heard a good sermon from Bible Baptist Church of North Las Vegas. The pastor preached against Halloween and the rise of Roman Catholicism, etc. It was a surprising contrast to the immorality of the city. My wife's father was saved out of the Greek Orthodox church, and had become a member of a Calvary Chapel in Vegas. Please remember the family in prayer. He was a very cheerful man that was always very interested in the lives of his four grown daughters, and many grandchildren. He sometimes smiled or joked at our "ways" in Texas, but it was never in bitterness or biting sarcasm; recently he told my wife that we are "doing things right." His cheerful calls, every day or so, will be greatly missed by my dear wife.

GARY DEMAR'S RECENT RAMBLINGS
****************************************
While traveling, I heard an advertisement for an upcoming "prophecy" seminar with Hank Hanegraff and Gary Demar in Tennessee. The real agenda was to use the modern interest in Bible prophecy to indoctrinate people into preterism (the teaching that Bible prophecy - or most of it - has been fulfilled in A.D. 70.!). This morning, on a local, Christian radio station, I heard Gary Demar's radio program for the first time. He began by warning Christians not to punish the Republicans by staying home on Election Day. He then implied that premillenialism was responsible for the apathy of many Christians. He stated that he was very interested in discussing this point about prophecy, but that he would be willing to talk politics if his listeners were so inclined. I called in and told him that I did not see how a belief in the soon coming of Jesus, when rightly interpreted, could lead to apathy. I also asked him how he could reject literal interpretation in regard to the Second Coming, when there were already so many examples of literal fulfillment in relation to the First Coming (Isaiah 53:5, Psalms 22:16-18, 69:20-21, Zechariah 9:9, Matthew 21:5, etc.). He was excited to discuss literal interpretation - yet he did not give a response to my point about the precedence set by the Holy Spirit in relation to the First Coming prophecies. He argued that the words "at hand" really mean "soon." He then asked how I could view the Second Coming of the Lord to be "soon," since it has already been 2000-years since the Book of Revelation was penned. I told him that the Bible says the Lord's coming is "at hand" in Revelation 22:10. However, in Luke 21:31, it teaches that there will be certain signs that will alert us that His coming is NIGH at hand. Every generation could expect the Lord's coming, since it is imminent. Yet, as we see the stage-setting for various signs, we should be moved with even greater zeal to watch and remain ready. He replied that "at hand" and "NIGH at hand" mean the same thing! He seemed to stumble a bit as he tried to make this reckless argument. As I manifested the folly of his conclusion, he then rapidly switched to the Lord's words concerning "this generation" in Matthew 24. I responded that this was a double-prophecy. He asked for an example of double-prophecy in the Scriptures. I then took him to 1 Samuel 7:14, where it says that God will be a father to David's "son." I asked him who the "son" referred to in that Scripture. He said he would let me answer the question. I reminded him that 1 Chronicles 28:6 teaches that the words were fulfilled in Solomon; but Hebrews 1:5 teaches that the words were fulfilled generations later, in Jesus! He switched to a break and said we would continue our discussion after the break. When he returned, he made a statement about typology, went to another caller and hung up the line. He seemed to avoid the subject of prophecy for the rest of his program.

Of course, the example of double prophecy I gave is only one of multitudes of examples that could have been cited. To quibble over the terminology (the words "double prophecy") is like rejecting the doctrines of the Trinity or the Deity of Christ because such exact words or phrases are not found in the Bible (the word "Bible" is not even found in the Bible!). There are others arguing over the word "fulfillment" today. Such debates are straining at gnats. The point is that the Holy Ghost often has a near fulfillment/application of His prophecies, to be followed by a distant, future fulfillment. The near application is typical of the distant fulfillment. Therefore, we argue that many of the events in relation to A.D. 70 were typical of events still to come. In the bouncing ball of prophetic fulfillment, there is no need to hide any of our Lord's words under the bushel of "apocalyptic language" or "figurative interpretation."

Demar also used the common objection that almost "every generation" has expected the Lord's coming in their day. I told him that I especially wanted to comment upon this objection (though I did not get the time). First of all, every generation SHOULD have expected the Lord's coming! Jesus teaches that only evil servants teach that the Lord is going to delay His coming (Luke 12:45). Secondly, I have many rare, prophecy books (some from the 17th and 18th centuries). These writers, as I have argued elsewhere, actually expected the Lord's coming to be somewhere around the year 2000! And they even stated that ALL LEARNED MEN agree that the Lord's coming will be at such a time. For example, notice the following words:

"The world was ordained to endure, AS ALL LEARNED MEN AFFIRM and prove it with Scripture, six thousand years. Now, of that number there be past five thousand five hundred and fifty-two (years); so that there is no more left but four hundred and forty-eight."
(Philipp Melanchthon, 1497-1560)

"The great period of a thousand years, in which the church shall enjoy unexampled peace and felicity, is yet to begin. Its commencement is expected BY THE MOST JUDICIOUS COMMENTATORS, at a time, near the year 2000."
(Hugh Latimer, 1490-1555)

These quotes reveal that "all learned men" and "the most judicious commentators" in earlier generations expected the Lord's coming around the year 2000 - as long as it comes ON SCHEDULE! Yet, they believed that they needed to watch and be ready, just in case the Lord "cut the days short" and came earlier than expected!

These quotes show the ignorance of the unlearned objection that, "Every generation of Christians has expected the Lord's coming in their days." But Gary Demar did not want to discuss this issue any further!

Amazingly, Demar went on to argue that there were earthquakes and hurricanes in the Book of Acts, and that these events completely fulfilled the Lord's words in Luke 21:11.25. If I had been given the opportunity, I would have asked him why he was interpreting the Lord's words to be referring to LITERAL earthquakes and tsunamis. What happened to his "apocalyptic, figurative language"? It appears they decide at whim whether to interpret literally or figuratively.

The last preterist/postmil man I debated left the debate midway, with no explanation. If given the opportunity I would also gladly debate Gary Demar, for these men are attempting to appeal to the "high brow," scholar types who are nauseated by the "Left Behind" series. But they are overthrowing the faith of many; at the very least, they dampening the zeal of the saints. The imminent Second Coming of Jesus, with His fiery judgment, is a powerful stimulus for holy living. God forbid that we regulate our Lord's warnings concerning His coming to by-gone centuries!

Can Bible prophecy be hyped and marketed in a wrong manner? Yes. Can it be watered-down, and robbed of its warnings and responsibilities? Yes. But the answer to these problems is not to throw out the baby with the bathwater and adopt postmillennial preterism! How foolish. Preterism is the doctrine first espoused by John Humphrey Noyes (the founder of the free-loving, sexually-perverted Oneida Community in the 19th century). Noyse decided that since all of the prophecies concerning the Second Coming had been fulfilled (according to his new "revelation") - and since Jesus said there would be no marriage by those resurrected in His coming Kingdom - Noyse then argued that there was no marriage; thus he adopted "free love" (i.e. fornication). He taught that the Second Coming and the Kingdom of Heaven arrived in A.D. 70. This is the teaching of Gary Demar (without the conclusions adopted by Noyse, the originator of Demar's preterism).

The Bible teaches that in the end, Demar's scoffing preterism will be openly embraced by many in the churches:

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

Whatever one may think of the "Left Behind" movement, let's all avoid running helter skelter into the hopeless pit of post-millennial/peterism. The Devil loves to tempt the saints into pell-mell reactions to various problems or movements.

AN OBSERVATION FROM DONALD FITZGERALD ON ACCOUNTABILITY
*********************************************************************

Brother Fitzgerald from Colorado has sent in the following statement:

"As a Christian brother I would like to give a high recommendation to the materials written by Joey Faust, Gary Whipple, Arlen Chitwood, and Robert Govett. 'The Rod, Will God Spare It' (Faust), 'Shock and Surprise, Beyond the Rapture' (Whipple), 'Entering the Kingdom' (Govett), 'The Judgment Seat of Christ' (Chitwood), have now forced the Christian church to come clean, and look at the issues seriously, and take a stand one way or the other. This is quite evident in the fact, as of April 29, 2005, the Grace Evangelical Society has now banned books from Faust, Whipple, Govett, Dodson, and Wilson from being displayed at their conferences. Evidently they feel threatened by the truth that disobedient Christians will be excluded from the Millennial Kingdom, and thus will spend 1000 years in Outer Darkness or Hell (Gehenna); although, GES is not completely sure how to apply the warning passages to Christians in the New Testament:

1 Corinthians 3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall SUFFER LOSS: but he himself SHALL BE SAVED; yet so as by fire.
16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
17 If any man defile the temple of God, HIM SHALL GOD DESTROY; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.
(KJV)

For those who do not fully accept that disobedient Christians can be excluded from the 1000 year Millennial Kingdom, why do we have an example of a Christian being destroyed in 1 Cor 3:17? Isn't this verse in the same context as the Judgment Seat of Christ as seen in vs. 12-15? What Biblical justification do you have for ripping verse 16 and 17 out of context, from verses 12-15? The words 'shall be saved' are a future passive in both the English and Greek. In other words, Christians who suffer loss at the Judgment Seat will not by saved at that time; they will have to wait till the until 1000 year Millennium is over in order to realize the full benefits of their salvation. It is quite clear from verse 16 that destruction is a negative consequence for disobedient Christians at the Judgment Seat of Christ.

A number of years ago before I learned the truth about Millennial Exclusion for disobedient Christians, I had a conversation with a man that graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary. He was a member of the Grace Evangelical Society. He asked me if I knew the meaning of 1 Cor 3:16-17. I told him that I did not know, but that I would do some research on the subject. He then told me that he did not think his Professors from Seminary had any answers either. I then asked him why he asked me the question. He replied, 'Because I am afraid they apply to believers!' It was at that time that I found out that the Seminary and Bible college graduates were no better off then I was.

Romans 11:18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
21 For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.
22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
(KJV)

For those of you who accept Peter Ruckman's position (as a Hyper-dispensationalist) which applies all the 'goodies' in the NT to the church, and all the warning passages to Israel, What do you do with Romans 11:22 which warns a Gentile believer of being cut off? Whenever you start applying the warning passages to Israel, and none of them to the church, isn't that a subtle way of boasting against the branches? (v18). When you start doing this, are you not then being high-minded? (v20) You have to admit that a number of Christian churches are behaving just as poorly as Israel did in the Old Testament. Isn't it time you stopped boasting against the natural branches (Israel)? Isn't this position, espoused by Ruckman and his followers, a subtle way of being high-minded?

Despite the weaknesses of GES and the Hyper-Dispensationalist, the most objectionable position in Modern Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism is the teaching of Lordship Salvation presented by John MacArthur and his followers! I pulled the following article from the GES Newsletter which many of you might find interesting:

'On Saturday morning Dr. John MacArthur spoke in a plenary session on 'Faith in the Apostle James.' Dr. Earl Radmacher responded to his paper and did a good job of pointing out weaknesses in his approach. He pointed out, for example, that we establish doctrine in clear, not unclear, passages and hence it is wrong to go to James to prove one's doctrine of faith. He also pointed out that while Dr. MacArthur used over 20 different qualifiers for faith in his paper (e.g., dead faith, authentic faith, nominal faith, intellectual faith, heart faith, real faith, obedient faith, saving faith, sluggish faith), James used the term sixteen times in his letter without once using a modifier. He suggested that Dr. MacArthur's approach to the gospel was a road not back to Wittenberg, but to Rome.'

'After Dr. MacArthur's paper and the responses of Dr. Radmacher and one other, the audience was permitted to ask questions. Dr. Bob Wilkin was able to ask Dr. MacArthur two questions.'

BW: 'In light of 2 Corinthians 13:5, is examining ourselves to see if we are in the faith something that we as believers are to do regularly, throughout our lives?'

JM: (Paraphrase): 'Yes, we are to examine ourselves on an ongoing basis...Of course, this has relevance to assurance.'

BW: 'When, then, can a believer be 100% sure that he has passed the test?'

JM: 'I'm not sure what you mean by 100%.'

BW: 'I mean absolutely, positively sure.'

JM: (Paraphrase): 'Puritan writers said that such absolute assurance was not possible. We can have assurance, but not absolute certainty.'

BW: 'Thank you.'

One of the difficulties of Lordship Salvation, on top of its distortion of the gospel, is that it denies people assurance of their salvation. If this does not trouble you let me tell you about a conversation I had a number of years ago while attending college. I held a Bible study for college students when I was living in Alamosa. At that time John MacArthur just published his book, 'The Gospel According to Jesus.' There was a young lady at my study who was a former Roman Catholic, who became a believer weeks prior to the occasion. The church she was attending had her read through John MacArthur's book for a discipleship program she took part in. After she read the book she told me about her conclusions because I asked her what she thought of the book. She told me that MacArthur's position on Lordship Salvation was no different than what the Roman Catholic church was teaching her! This sends chills up my spine. John MacArthur's position on Lordship Salvation in the most dangerous teaching in Fundamental and Evangelical churches.

Therefore, I must emphasize that the books by Joey Faust, Gary Whipple, Robert Govett, and Arlen Chitwood are now forcing the Evangelical and Fundamental churches to come clean, and to take a stand one way or the other. These books are a must read for all Christians of every denominational persuasion. They do not pamper and excuse the carnality so prevalent in our churches, nor do they rob a Christian of absolute assurance of his eternal security after the Millennium is over.

*****************************************************************
HOW SHOULD WE REACT TO TED HAGGARD'S CONFESSIONS?
*****************************************************************
"(AgapePress) - Following accusations of drug use and a three-year homosexual relationship, one of the men named by TIME Magazine in February 2005 among 'America's 25 Most Influential Evangelicals' has stepped down from his church and resigned a prominent position in the nation's evangelical movement. While Rev. Ted Haggard denies any homosexual relationship, he has admitted to purchasing some drugs -- but says he did not use them."

I had never heard of Pastor Ted Haggard (that I can remember) until the other night, when my wife's uncle (a Roman Catholic who lives in Colorado), showed me his church web site. We read the doctrinal statement of his 14,000 member church, and discussed the Gospel, and the differences between Bible Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church. I told him that we would differ from Haggard in that we would be considered more conservative in standards, etc. I am now thankful that I stated our differences (I was tempted to leave them out of the discussion). I had no idea that in a few days, Haggard would confess to buying "meth" from a homosexual, and be accused of having a long, homosexual relationship. His confession to buying illegal drugs is enough, and I certainly hope the other accusations prove to be false (though his church board has now found him guilty of sexual indiscretions).

Of course, the Catholic Church has been scandalized to no end, with all of the publicity surrounding the numerous pedophile priests, and their attempts to hide the sins. But there is a tendency among many Evangelicals to adopt a "everyone sins" attitude. For example:

"The president of the National Clergy Council in Washington, DC...Rev. Rob Schenck [stated] 'we must prayerfully wait out the investigative process [in the Haggard matter] and continue to judge by the evidence.' But should the allegations prove true, he adds, it will just be affirmation of man's sinful nature. 'The Bible says if we say we have no sin, we lie and the truth is not in us,' says Schenck in a press release." (AgapePress)

Increasingly, Christians are adopting the "no one is perfect" attitude in response to failure and sin. More and more are embracing the teaching that all sin is the same, and that there are no lesser or greater sins. Once this doctrine is advocated, it results in the following conclusions:

A. No sins are greater or lesser than others.
B. Every man sins.
= Â Every man sins to the same degree before God.
= Â No one can decry the sins of another, since all are, therefore, guilty.

Any argument built upon an erroneous foundation is doomed to fall. It is true that in regard to eternal salvation, everyone has sinned, and in the final analysis it does not matter to what degree one sins - all sinners are doomed to hell and the Lake of Fire. Yet, even here, every sinner does not suffer the same degree of torment in the Lake of Fire. Jesus teaches that the degree of light will largely determine the degree of judgment.

But after salvation, are we to believe that every sin is the same in the eyes of God? According to the Bible, this popular teaching is not true:

John 19:11 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the GREATER SIN.

According to Jesus (in contrast to many modern, Evangelical theologians), there are greater and lesser sins:

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven...

If there are lesser commandments, it follows that there are lesser sins.

It is true that we must leave absolute judgment to God, for only God knows all of the facts associated with a person's degree of responsibility:

Luke 12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.

There are sins for which a believer is to be excluded from a church (1 Corinthians 5). But on the basis of much of the modern (so-called) evangelical teaching, we would have to conclude that NO ONE could ever be excluded from a church, since everyone are sinners to the same degree! The guilty party could argue:

"Hey, the church has no right to exclude me. Everyone sins. No sin is worse than any other. He who is without sin, let him cast the first vote! In reality, you are all hypocrites. Everyone is a hypocrite. How can you say that my sin is darker than your own sins?"

Surely, this is a dogma of Satan, disguised with a form of godliness and false humility. I therefore rebuke the lying doctrine of devils that every pastor is secretly a dope-smoker, blatant adulterer, or worse. It is true that those who fall should be restored in meekness, and that we can all fall if we do not take heed. But this is a far cry from the passive, unbiblical defeatism that has been embraced by so many today in the name of humility. Do we have anything to offer sinners other than a future salvation? Is there any victory that can and should be experienced by every saint of God in this life? Indeed there is:

Romans 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.

How should we react to these continual reports of failure among the brethren?

We should realize that it is to be somewhat expected since most churches are being wise in their own eyes. Jesus warned the disciples (James, Peter and John) about hell and missing the kingdom (Mark 9, Matthew 5, 18, Luke 12, etc.). Modern Christians have largely concluded that they can get better results from pop psychology and fluffy, humorous expositions, than from preaching the Lord's warnings. If the Lord warned His disciples, it is because the Lord's disciples need such warnings, when rightly interpreted. And any preacher who fails to preach them as much as Jesus did is helping the Devil.

Secondly, we should also realize that the Bible predicted the fall of many Christians:

1 Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

The word "some" often means "many" in the Bible, and in the dictionary. Notice again:

2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;

And again:

2 Thessalonians 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a FALLING AWAY FIRST, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

The Bible teaches that many true saints will fall away into great sins and heresy. Also, there will be many false professors in the churches:

Jude 1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves WITHOUT FEAR: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

Jude warns that these fallen saints and false saints will walk in sexual sins, and will greatly reject the teaching on the fear of God.

Therefore, do the modern sins of many conservative preachers invalidate the Scriptures? No, they actually reveal, once again, that the Bible is to be interpreted literally. If we are to believe the postmillennial preterists, we would have to look for nothing but "good times" ahead. They believe all these verses about the "falling away" occurred in past history ONLY. Instead, we see that they have a double application: applying to the early Gnostics, and looking on past them to our days. Once again, the Bible is proved to be literally true! Let us take heed that we do not become high-minded and judges of evil thoughts. Let us mourn the fallen state of our churches. But let us never forget that our Lord warned us beforehand. The love of many will wax cold! May we love the Lord and one another with a pure heart fervently!

        <h1>THE RV AND HISTORY: THE COMMON MAN IN THE 19TH CENTURY NOT SUCKERED</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Last week we took a look at a sober warning from 1858 about what would happen if pastors began to replace the AV with "new bibles" in churches. From the day the RV was published, this began to come to pass exactly as the writer predicted. It immediately began to "eat as doth a canker" until it produced the state we see today. When scribes first began to get excited about their new manuscript "finds, many good pastors and popular Christian leaders were confused and hood-winked. At first they praised this new "bible" and did their best to console an angry public by attempting to praise and defend the characters of the Revisers. The common people would not buy it. They were lied to and they immediately saw through all the scribal "baloney":

"The revisers were to introduce as few changes as possible, consistent with fidelity to the text. However, many changes were made...a large proportion seemed pointless to the general reader, and, in respect of the New Testament at least, the revisers were accused of pedantry. The New
Testament [RV] was published in 1881, the Old Testament in 1885..."
(The Cambridge Bible Handbook)

Therefore, within a short period the majority of conservative Christian leaders were not as forward in their acceptance of the RV. After having some time to notice the attack by the RV upon such passages as John 7:53-8:11, etc., together with the outcries of the common people, they began to change their tune. Instead of actually using this new bible in the churches they would simply quote from it every now and then. They were confused. The majority of these conservative pastors began to preach that "Our Version" should never be "replaced" by the RV.

It is important to realize the confusing situation that such men as Spurgeon and Brookes, etc. were in. On one side was this giant "scholarly" marketing campaign with its smokescreen of intimidation, and on the other side was a discerning public that was downright angry with the whole mess. Let us go back more than a century and hear from some newspapers and magazines around the time of the RV; a time when the "common man" was a bit more manly and discerning than today!:

"The revised version of the New Testament was awaited with keen interest, and was received with an almost unbroken chorus of disapproval. The public are astounded at the number and character of the changes in the Authorized text...Elaborate criticisms appear in most of the daily papers, all condemnatory, and convicting the revisers of disregarding their pledges to introduce the fewest alterations possible. These articles quote scores of examples where the changes were purely frivilous and capricious, and denounce the self-opinionated scholarship of the motley combination of theologians and professors, which has disfigured, mangled and made
unrecognizable some of the noblest passages in the Bible. The Saturday Review complains of the childish pedantry of the revisers, and describes the new version as sadly inferior to the old one in general vigor and beauty of language."
(London Dispatch to the New York Tribune, 1881)

"Whatever may be the opinion of some, the public has long since weighed the Revised Version in the balances and found it wanting...They have turned away from the new with a conviction that it could be no substitute for that which still forms the moral and spiritual backbone of the English
people...The Authorized Version is the outcome of faith and zeal that have never been excelled. How is this to be accounted for?...The Revisers cannot be said to have been baptized in the same spirit or to have been overwhelmed by any such self-devotion. They have clung to the most ancient copies without any regard to their character...An unlooked for discovery has shown that the alterations made by the Revisers were for the worse and not for the better. After their NT was issued, Ciasca lighted upon an Arabic translation of Tatian's Diatessaron. This takes us back to the text of the year 150, and decides in favor of the Authorized readings against those of the Revised...Those preachers who confide in them, and who give their congregations 'the more correct reading', are not airing their knowledge but revealing their ignorance."
(Word and Work Magazine, quoted in The Truth, 1896)

Today barely a soul has even heard of the RV, let alone ever "read" one! We have seen the ASV and the RSV and the NAS and the NIV all try to use the same worn out techniques the RV tried against the AV. Yet, although the "common man" has now lost much of his former "common" sense, "KJV Onlyism" is still today stronger than it was over 100 years ago. We have more light! Even the most hardened must admit that there is something almost unbelievable about this KJV! You can't kill it. Have you ever analyzed why you hate it so much? You may grow old and die along with disco, hoola-hoops, Elvis, Ritalin, and whatever "bible" they are trying to sell to the public this year...but trust me, "Our Version" isn't going anywhere!

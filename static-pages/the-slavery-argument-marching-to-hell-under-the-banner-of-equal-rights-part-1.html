        <h1>THE SLAVERY ARGUMENT: MARCHING TO HELL UNDER THE BANNER OF EQUAL RIGHTS PT 1</h1>
        <div id="content">
            I spent most of my childhood in South Carolina (I am 37 years old). I vividly remember awaking one night to a cross burning in the yard across from our house. A black couple had moved into our neighborhood. I grew up among T-shirts with Confederate flags, and concerts which proclaimed, "The South shall rise again!" Politically, I believe in the rights of states as intended by the framers of our Constitution, and I think that the Republicans and Democrats are BOTH guilty of attempting to produce and feed a mammoth, Socialist, welfare-state. I have the South in my bones. Yet, I will NOT defend the unlawful system of slavery advocated by some of the 19th century, Baptist preachers in the Southern states. Perhaps, in God's mercy, if more Baptists had stood against slavery, it is very possible that the Civil War (which pitted two moral doctrines against each another: the rights of states, and the rights of blacks, as humans) might never have occurred. But the status of Baptists had improved considerably in the 19th century. They went from having almost no churches in the South in the 18th century, to becoming the largest denomination in America at the start of the 19th century. The political founders of our country were influenced by the writings of the Baptists. After the Revolution, it was therefore no longer "uncouth" to be a Baptist. Many rich, Southern plantation owners, for the first time, flocked to Baptist churches. When Baptist pastors in the South (at the start of the 19th century) looked out from their pulpits and beheld their congregations, they saw as many church members who owned COLORED SLAVES, as Baptist preachers today see church members who own COLOR TV'S (hooked up to HBO)! And it would have been as unpopular then to preach that church members should give up their slaves, as it would be to preach that church members, today, should disconnect worldly programming on their TV's (i.e. 1 Corinthians 15:33, Psalms 101:3, Psalms 119:63). Perhaps a better example would be the Biblical doctrine that mothers should be "keepers at home" (Titus 2:5, 1 Timothy 5:14, Psalms 68:12, 113:9, Proverbs 7:11, 14:1). As with slavery, the income and standard of living of those who obey this command is (in some ways) diminished. Therefore, as with slavery, many modern preachers remain silent and refuse to "upset" what has become a cultural norm (i.e. the two-income family with children on Ritalin, raised by daycares and public schools). The parallel is even more pronounced when we remember that Booker T. Washington ("Up From Slavery") described how many Southern women had long forgotten how to perform domestic chores! Such work was seen as something "undignified." It was "for the slaves." The South had lost the Biblical work ethic (1 Corinthians 4:12, Ephesians 4:28, 1 Thessalonians 2:9, 2 Thessalonians 3:8). The plain truth is that a great number of "important" (i.e. rich) people would have LEFT the Baptist churches if slavery had been reproved by the Baptist preachers (just like many churches today would lose more than half their membership if Titus 2 was even READ from the pulpit without thirty minutes of "watering down" the verses with unbiblical DISCLAIMERS). At least one-third of Baptist membership in the South Carolina churches were slave-holders. With the "sprinkling" Methodists gaining ground on every corner, and Baptists, for the first time in history, finally possessing the freedom to evangelize and build their churches without persecution, it was obviously very tempting for Baptist preachers in the South to wash their hands like Pilate, and blame the African's plight on Ham (i.e. Noah's son, not pork). Evangelism and church building have always been used to excuse many sins and unholy prejudices in God's people. We should therefore learn from past mistakes. We should STRIVE to win souls and build churches; but we must remember that we must strive LAWFULLY (2 Timothy 2:5). The old words of Martin Luther are ever true:

"If I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion of the truth of God except precisely that little point that the world and the devil are at the moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ, however boldly I may be professing Christ. Where the battle rages is where the loyalty of the soldier is proved, and to be steady on all the battlefield besides is merely flight and disgrace if he flinches at that point."

Compromising preachers often fail to take a stand for certain truths. How easy it is to justify sin (or be silent) when the entire culture embraces it (i.e. "You don't have a TV, or watch worldly movies? What do you do with your time, and how do you stay informed?"; "You don't have slaves? How do you wash clothes and feed the animals?"). We can and should learn from the sins of our forefathers. But the main purpose of this article is to set the record straight, historically. When modern, fundamental Christians preach against homosexuality, feminism, humanism, etc., they are often met with the following objection, I recently read:

"Say, aren't these the same people that fought for slavery? Where were their morals then?"

Indeed, the injustices of "men-stealing" (1 Timothy 1:10, Genesis 37:27, 40:15, Exodus 21:16), and the unlawful form of slavery advocated by some Christians in history, are often used to prove that "Christian culture" is wrong in every other area where modern people desire liberty. However, it should be obvious to everyone that every desired liberty is not holy or godly. And even those who foolishly advocate immorality will usually draw the line somewhere. Those who use American slavery to justify ignoring Biblical, traditional morality in regard to the family, should remember that America abolished the SLAVE TRADE in 1808, due to CHRISTIAN INFLUENCES! Britain had abolished the slave trade in 1807; they abolished slavery in their empire in 1833. John Newton (1725-1807) was the writer of the famous hymn, "Amazing Grace." Before his conversion, he was a brutal, immoral slave trader, and the captain of a slave ship. After he repented, he published the book, "Thoughts on the African Slave Trade," which was based on his own experiences as a wretched sinner. This book helped influence the abolition of slavery in Britain. William Wilberforce (1759-1833) was inspired by the testimony of John Newton, and he looked to him for spiritual guidance. Under the anti-slavery influences of Newton and John Wesley, Wilberforce (though only five feet tall) became the tallest leader in the crusade that would, in the end, abolish slavery in Britain. He delivered his first anti-slavery motion to the floor of the House of Commons in 1789. He would live to see his labors rewarded in England.

Therefore, CHRISTIANITY abolished slavery in Britain (and the slave trade in America) BEFORE evolution, public education, and Hollywood (the things many foolish people think are "progress"). Many modern people also forget that the early, evolutionary scientists (the supposed "enlightened" ones) carried their dogma to its logical conclusion, and proclaimed that the different races should also be arranged on an evolutionary totem pole. They concluded that the darker the skin, the closer a person is to the apes! The REAL title of Darwin's infamous book was, "The Origin of the Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of FAVORED RACES in the Struggle for Life" (1859). In "The Descent of Man," Darwin wrote:

"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly EXTERMINATE AND REPLACE THE SAVAGE RACES throughout the world....The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the CAUCASIAN, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro [sic] or Australian and the gorilla."

T. H. Huxley, Darwin's disciple, stated:

"...no rational man, cognizant of the facts, believes that the average negro [sic] is the equal, still less the superior, of the average white man....The highest places in the hierarchy of civilization will assuredly not be within the reach of our dusky cousins...."

Christ-hating philosophers like Nietzsche developed this evolutionary dogma into a "tight" package so Hitler could later use it to butcher millions of so-called "inferior races."

And not only were the "enlightened" scientists and philosophers no practical friend to slaves, but the "liberal" churches (Southern Unitarians, Universalists, etc.) did NOT oppose American slavery. In Southern cities, slave ownership was a symbol of prestige. Unitarianism (since it rejects the fundamental Bible doctrines) often appealed to the rich and worldly educated (1 Corinthians 1:18-21). And these were, of course, the first to own slaves as a status symbol.

After the abolition of the slave trade, many of the Christian disagreements concerning slavery hinged upon how to deal with the slaves already on American soil. Many Christian and political leaders had long advocated a gradual process of abolition. Pioneer BAPTIST preacher, David Barrow (1753-1819), took a strong stand against slavery. Some letters he received from Thomas Jefferson reveal the popularity of the gradual view of abolition:

"Both parties require long and difficult preparation....that of the slave is to be prepared by instruction and habit for self-government, and for the honest pursuits of industry and social duty. Both of these courses of preparation require time, and the former must precede the latter." (Thomas Jefferson to David Barrow, 1815)

"The particular subject of the pamphlet [against slavery] you enclosed me was one of early and tender consideration with me, and had I continued in the councils of my own State, it should never have been out of sight. The only practicable plan I could ever devise is stated under the 14th Query of my Notes on Virginia, and it is still the one most sound in my judgment....Where the disease is most deeply seated, there it will be slowest in eradication. In the Northern States it was merely superficial and easily corrected. In the Southern, it is incorporated with the whole system and requires time, patience, and perseverance in the curative process. That it may finally be effected and its progress hastened, will be [my] last and fondest prayer." (Thomas Jefferson to David Barrow, 1815)

Before stereotyping the early Baptists as "bigoted slave owners," modern liberals and defenders of perversion, should remember that THE BAPTISTS were VERY instrumental in establishing religious liberty in America:

"Freedom of conscience, unlimited freedom of mind, was from the first the trophy of the Baptists." (George Bancroft, "History of the United States," 1840)

"The Baptists were the first propounders of absolute liberty, just and true liberty, equal and impartial liberty." (John Locke)

This history is largely forgotten today. It is not "politically correct" to remember it. It does not fit the "agenda" of liberals, homosexuals, feminists, etc., who wish to paint modern, fundamental Baptists as the philosophical descendants of wife-beating, slave-whipping, Bible-thumpers in the 19th century. What is even lesser known (or admitted) today, is the extent that early Baptists reproved slavery. It is true, as we have already noted, that when Baptists were no longer persecuted after the Revolution, and they became the largest denomination in the South (if not in America), and many rich plantation owners (for the first time in history) became members of their churches, that some in the South increasingly embraced and defended slavery. However, this fails to realize how many Southern Baptists LEFT THE SOUTH over the issue. And it fails to realize the extent that Baptists reproved slavery, especially before the Revolution, when they were persecuted street preachers, often deemed to be "fanatics" by the established ministers (e.g. between 1768-1777, at least 30 Baptist preachers were whipped or imprisoned).

EARLY BAPTISTS AGAINST SLAVERY

Most people have read of the fiery preaching of Wesley and Finney against slavery. Yet, many are not aware of the extent that BAPTISTS also reproved the sin.

In 1652, Rhode Island passed the first law in North America against slavery. BAPTIST preacher, John Clark (who founded the FIRST Baptist church on America soil), received a Royal Charter for Rhode Island in 1663.

It has been said that no individual since Roger Williams ("Baptistic" preacher) is better known as a champion of religious liberty than Isaac Backus (1704-1806). For his work and energy, he has also been called the "father of American Baptists." He was the most influential Baptist leader in Colonial America. In 1785, he wrote, "Godliness excludes slavery, in Answer to John Cleaveland." In 1805, a year before his death, he wrote the following words:

"The liberty that he [Roger Williams] was for, civil and religious, is now enjoyed in thirteen of the seventeen of the United States of America. No tax for any religious minister is imposed by authority in any of the said 13 states, and their power is weakened in the other 4. SLAVERY is also abolished in the northern states and it is wearing away in the rest..." (Letter to Elder William Richards, April 20th, 1805)

Backus preached in the homes of blacks. In 1773, Backus received a letter from a fellow Baptist in condemnation of slavery, which he then read to his church:

"I take liberty to offer to your consideration one thing that I verily believe ought to be razed out of the church of Christ: and that is the making slaves of the poor Negroes....Though I know of but few in our [Baptist] churches that have Negro slaves, yet the thing is allowed and not witnessed against as I think it ought to be...That it appears to me high time for the watchmen to sound an alarm against this practice, and for churches to purge themselves from these..." (Ebenzer Smith to Isaac Backus, 1773)

The following year, Backus praised the Continental Congress for their concern over slavery.

On one occasion Backus wrote:

"No man abhors that wicked practice [of slavery] more than I do, and would gladly make use of lawful means towards the abolishing of slavery in all parts of the land. But let us consider where we are, and what we are doing. In the Articles of Confederation no provision was made to hinder the importation of slaves into any of these states; but a door is now open hereafter to do it, and each state is at liberty now to abolish slavery as soon as they please....Slavery grows more odious through the world; and as an honorable gentleman said some days ago, 'Though we cannot say that slavery is struck with an apolexy, yet we may hope it will die with consumption."

In 1787, the Warren (Baptist) Association (Rhode Island), after referring to the slave trade as "menstealing," stated:

"We therefore earnestly desire all our brethren to guard against giving the least countenance to this Heaven daring wickedness."

In 1787, the Kentockian Association (Virginia) stated:

"...hereditary slavery was a breach of the divine law."

It appointed a committee to form a plan for "gradual emancipation."

In 1789, the Philadelphia Baptist Association (urged by the First Baptist Church of Baltimore) praised existing abolition societies, and recommended that its churches form similar societies:

"...this Association declares their high approbation of the several societies formed in the United States and Europe, for the gradual abolition of the slavery of the Africans....and do hereby recommend to the churches we represent to form similar societies to become members thereof and exert themselves to obtain this important object."

John Leland (1754-1841) was a friend to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Against the evils of slavery, he wrote:

"The whole scene of slavery is pregnant with enormous evils....why not liberate them at once? Would to Heaven this were done! The sweets of rural and social life will never be well enjoyed, until it is the case."

In 1790, he proposed a resolution adopted by the Baptist General Committee of Virginia. It read:

"Resolved, That slavery is a violent deprivation of the rights of nature and inconsistent with a republican government, and therefore recommend it to our brethren to use every legal measure to extirpate this horrid evil from the land; and pray Almighty God that our honorable Legislature may have it in their power to proclaim the great Jubilee consistent with the principles of good policy."

In 1792 the General Committee passed another, softer resolution declaring that the issue of slavery belonged to the legislative body.

John Asplund (1755-1807), an early chronicler of Baptist history, in 1791, wrote against, "keeping our fellow creatures in bondage, who had as good a right as we, both to civil and religious liberty."

In 1792, the Shaftesbury Baptist Association (Vermont) stated:

"That this association being impressed with a sense of that freedom which every child of Adam is entitled to by nature, and which they cannot be deprived but by hostile usurpation, take this method of manifesting their hearty detestation of the slave trade, and recommend it to our brethren to pray Almighty God, to hasten the auspicious day when the Ethiopian with all the human race shall enjoy the liberty due to every good citizen of the commonwealth, and the name of slave be extirpated from the earth."

John Clark (d.1833) was a Baptist preacher who moved to Illinois, where he joined, "The Baptized Church of Christ, Friends of Humanity," and became active in the anti-slavery movement.

In 1797, the Dover Baptist Association (Virginia) stated:

"We sincerely sympathize, both as Christians and citizens, with these unhappy people [black slaves], and although we think it a delicate matter, we would not wish to be backward in promoting their happiness and liberty, upon cautious ground. We would, therefore, recommend to our Brethren to unite with the Abolition Societies in proposing a petition to the General Assembly for their gradual emancipation upon some rational and benevolent plan."

In 1807, the Elkhorn Baptist Association (Kentucky) divided over slavery, and Baptist preachers David Barrow and Carter Tarrant, led in the formation of the "Baptized Licking Locust Association, Friends of Humanity," which was dedicated to preaching against slavery.

In 1807, the Miami Baptist Association, in regard to its churches, urged that, "caution be used in admitting among them those who held the sentiment and practice of hereditary slavery."

In 1808, the New York Baptist Association stated:

"In the opinion of this association the practice of slaveholding ought to be discountenanced as much as possible."

In 1815, the Sandy Creek Baptist Association (North Carolina) condemned the buying and selling of slaves for profit.

In 1818, the Chowan Baptist Association (North Carolina) condemned the buying and selling of slaves for profit.

In 1815, the Cumberland River Baptist Association (Kentucky) stated:

"We conceive that all nations, by nature, have a right to equal freedom....We think it would be best to wait for the dispensations of Providence, and pray to God for the happy year of their [the black slaves] deliverance to commence."

In 1835, English Baptists James Hoby and Francis Cox sailed to America to admonish American Baptists to abolish slavery.

In 1835, the Sandy Creek Association (North Carolina) again stood against the "selling and buying of slaves."

By 1835, two-thirds of the delegates to the meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society (in New England) were BAPTIST and Methodist preachers.

In the North, opposition to slavery grew increasingly fervent. Northern Baptist fellowships began to forbid its members to have any fellowship with slaveholders. In 1836, the Hancock Baptist Association (Maine) called for immediate emancipation.

In 1837, popular Baptist preacher, William Henry Brisbane, left South Carolina due to his stand against slavery. (Meanwhile, Alexander Campbell, the "Church of Christ" preacher, was stayed busy writing tracts and articles in defense of slavery).

In 1839, Freewill Baptists stated:

"Resolved, That it is with sorrow of heart that we learn that slavery is tolerated, practiced, and defended in certain portions of the Christian church."

South Carolina and North Carolina Baptists allowed blacks to become members of their churches, and they tried to greatly improve the condition of slaves. Yet, in the face of fierce opposition, they felt compelled to DEFEND the institution of slavery against the "meddling Northern abolitionists."

In 1840, the American Baptist Anti-Slavery Convention met in New York and caused great agitation. By 1845, American Baptists finally split over slavery, and the Southern Baptist Convention was born. But it would be wrong to claim that every Baptist preacher in the Deep South supported slavery. Many Baptists left the South over the issue. For example, J. M. Pendleton (1811-1891), while a Baptist preacher in Kentucky in the late 1830's, wrote many articles against slavery under the heading, "A Southern Emancipationist" (published in, "The Examiner"). He once wrote (and practically prophesied):

"My spirit sank within me and I saw no hope for the African race in Kentucky or anywhere else without the interposition of some providential judgment."

Pendleton was a friend of the great revival preacher, J. R. Graves. Pendleton authored the popular, Baptist pamphlet, "An Old Landmark Reset." In 1857, he became a joint-editor of, "The Tennessee Baptist" with Graves. It had the widest circulation of all the Baptist papers (in the world) of the day. He was also an editor of, "The Southern Baptist Review." While living in Tennessee, Pendleton was unwilling to look at the Confederate flag. His convictions finally caused him to leave the South in 1862. His son fought for the South and was killed.

In England, Baptist preachers like Charles Spurgeon, often rebuked the sin of America slavery:

"...we do not so intensely hate slavery as we should do if we saw it before our eyes: then would the blood boil, when we saw our black brother, smitten by the cow-hide whip. Imagine a slaveholder standing here and smiting his poor slave until the red blood gushed forth in a river; can you conceive your indignation? Now it is distance which makes you feel this less acutely." (January 23rd, 1859)

Yet, in America, intense debate stirred for decades. Soon, the nation was ultimately divided in horrible bloodshed. The destructive consequences of slavery have only begun to be experienced by our nation. Today, every perverse group imaginable uses the slavery issue to attempt to disqualify fundamentalist, literal interpretation of the Scriptures, and Christian preaching against its sins.

THE ATTEMPT TO LINK 19TH CENTURY SLAVE OWNERSHIP WITH MODERN "HOMOPHOBIA"

When good Christians sin (knowingly or unknowingly), the Word of God is blasphemed, and much evil is then justified by the world. The fact that many Christians in the South defended slavery is supposed to prove that modern, fundamental Christians are "blind" like some of their forefathers. In other words (as many argue today), since some of the Christian forefathers used the Bible to justify men-stealing and slavery, modern Christians, likewise, wrongly use the Bible to condemn homosexuality (or so the argument goes). This argument has first fueled the evils of feminism (which has practically destroyed the institution of the family in society, and millions of unborn babies). Homosexuality has attempted to follow hot upon the heels of feminism, seeking to enter in by the same door. Other antichrist "rights" movements are not far behind these movements. Unless the Lord checks this rapid decay of society with a temporary revival of Biblical morality - pedophilia, bestiality and cannibalism (and who knows what else) will also seek acceptance under the banner of "progressive enlightenment."

Notice a recent e-mail (among hundreds) I have received from the homosexual community:

"Dear Gay protest group, I guess you have placed yourself above others in a god-like manner and in front of the eyes of god. All I expected was a simple answer to my last

e-mail, and you would not even do that. I still await a response to that e-mail, and now this one. Now you claim victory over the ballpark and now Six Flags. Think about

what you are doing to our already depressed economy. Your actions are going to put hundreds of people out of jobs because you are trying to drive away the public from these businesses that know how to accept change, unlike you. Despite your efforts, you are not going to be able to stop the fact that the gay culture will continue to strive and grow. This is the dawn of the new Millennium, and with that, the abolishment of the segregation, one culture at a time. FIRST IT WAS AGAINST WOMEN, THEN AFRICAN-AMERICANS, NOW HOMOSEXUALS. Your little protest is doing nothing more than hindering the path of evolution. You need to learn to accept the culture for what it is, and not for what it isn't. The only reason why you think it's an abomination is because it is something that you are afraid of. The truth of the matter lays in you upbringings. As I mentioned in my previous letter, your hatred towards gays stems from your learned hatred against African-Americans, and all other forms of Hatred. People fear the unknown, and Hatred stems from fear. Therefore people accustom themselves to hate the things they have never had the opportunity to experience..." Sincere Regards, A Local Homosexual." (Michael Robinson)

He is, no doubt, referring to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, when business owners were forced by law to service and hire people of a different color. The homosexuals (and the pedophiles after them) plan to RIDE THE SAME WAVE, using the same argument of "equal rights." It all began when Baptist leaders argued for equal rights before and directly after the American Revolution. Did these God-given rights apply also to the slaves? This was a holy question raised by fundamental CHRISTIANS. But soon, women were using the argument to seek the right to vote, leave the home and become the breadwinner, with equal pay as men, and preach in churches. Today, homosexuals are using the argument that has worked so well for the feminists. And anyone who tells them they are greatly deceived, is likened unto rich, concubine-raping, tobacco-smoking, Scripture-quoting slave-masters in the South who had slaves horsewhipped if they dared to preach the Bible to other slaves. This is the AGENDA of the homosexuals, as the following news report demonstrates:

"'Bible as hate speech' bill passes - Sponsor: 'It's been a good week for equality in Canada' - Canada's House of Commons passed a controversial bill yesterday opposed by religious believers and free-speech advocates who say it will criminalize public expression against homosexual behavior....'It's been a good week for equality in Canada,' said the bill's sponsor, Svend Robinson, an openly homosexual member of Parliament....Some members of Parliament called it a 'dangerous' law that muzzles free speech, including Liberal Party member John McKay, who dubbed it a 'chill bill.' 'Anybody who has views on homosexuality that differ from Svend Robinson's will be exposed rather dramatically to the joys of the Criminal Code,' he said, according to the Edmonton Sun. Rushfeldt contends one of the law's dangers is the term 'sexual orientation' is not defined. He noted the American Psychiatric Association lists 24 behaviors under 'sexual orientation.' They include polygamy, bestiality and pedophilia...." (WND, Sept. 18, 2003)

Therefore, we can expect the argument to be tirelessly repeated. Homosexuality (and all other perversions) are planning on riding the same EVOLUTION TRAIN that supposedly liberated blacks and women. However, there is a big difference. The liberty of blacks in America (like the liberty of religion) was due (at least foundationally) to CHRISTIAN principles. The same may be said for the godly protections in society for women and children, which were contended for by Christians. But much of the so-called "liberty" of women has been due to INFIDEL principles (e.g. see, "The Women's Bible" by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the infidel mother of feminism). And it has wrecked our nation, destroyed families, and has served as the primary foundation for the "sexual revolution" (which served as the foundation for the "homosexual revolution"). The so-called "liberty" of homosexuals, pedophiles, and all other abominable perverts (which all define "liberty" to mean that no one else is at LIBERTY to say that these lifestyles are wrong, or to protect their children from them!) is, and will increasingly be, due to SATANIC principles.

Frederick Douglas once told a group of Bible-hating feminists that their day of liberation would come, but that they must first wait for the black man to be liberated. The modern homosexual is quick to simply add his perverted group to a list of sinners waiting in line for "liberation," using the liberty of the black race and the feminists as earlier examples of "progress" against old-fashioned, Christian bigotry.

Many Christians in the South believed that slavery should one day be abolished, but not at the expense of what they viewed as despotism. Others believed that since the Bible commands "servants" to be obedient to masters, that this justified the American system of slavery. Many of these Christians would also profess to be fighting against despotism. A letter to, "The Tennessee Baptist," in 1861, reads:

"I am proud that my native State, 'Old Tennessee,' has taken so noble a stand in defense of Southern rights. I am sorry though that she contains any traitors, any sympathizers of the Lincoln DESPOTISM."

The same year, the magazine also received letters from slaves voicing their support for the "cause" of the South. (See also, Jodie Gilmore, "Acknowledging Black Confederates...Many black Americans supported the Southern cause," http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2003/09-22-2003/vo19no19_confederates.htm)

After the Civil War, J. R. Graves (editor of "The Tennessee Baptist" for forty-five years), revealed what was in the heart of many of the preachers who defended the South:

"...it was the inalienable right of thirteen states and ten millions of freemen to rule themselves, and no treason to assert it....I am not ashamed of what I have done...The recent hopes of the South are forever annihilated: to renew them would be preposterously absurd. The government, even as it now is, is the best and freest that earth can boast; and let us as brothers and fellow citizens, pray God to make it all that a pure government can be in greatness and glory....By our political differences we rent the mightiest nation; shall we now allow Satan, through us, to rend the body of Christ by our political grudges and divisions?...From this day forward let it be said, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.'...There is [however] no hope for the nation while Satan reigns."
("Satan Dethroned," preached in Memphis, Tenn., soon after the evacuation of the city by the Federal troops)

It must therefore be admitted that slavery and state's rights were causes of the Civil War, and that much confusion reigned. Such a horrible calamity upon a nation, and division among families, certainly makes a good case for the Civil War (regardless of earthly causes) being seen as the "providential judgment" that Pendleton viewed as the only hope to end the sin of slavery in America. What then, may we ask, will God use to end ABORTION?

THE CIVIL WAR: A DIVINE JUDGMENT?

"I tremble for my country, when I remember that God is just."
(Thomas Jefferson, on the American system of slavery)

The system of slavery in America was a great evil. And it could be argued that the horrible Civil War (regardless of earthly causes) was a Divine judgment upon the nation for defending or IGNORING the issue of slavery. Abraham Lincoln, in his second presidential inaugural address (March 4, 1865), stated that he believed that the Civil War was Divine retribution for slavery. A few years before, in 1862, the great Baptist preacher, Charles Spurgeon, warned:

"Remember, too, that the cause of this suffering is a national sin - the sin of slavery. We have not yet passed the third generation, and upon a nation God visits sin to the third and fourth generation. We have rid ourselves, at last, of this accursed stain so far as our present Government is concerned, we are therefore delivered from any fear in future on that ground; but still, if slavery be now in America, we must remember that it would not have been there if it had not been carried there, and we are partners in guilt. Moreover, there has been too much winking at slavery amongst the merchants of Manchester and Liverpool. There has not been that abhorrence of the evil which should have been, and therefore it is just in the Providence of God that when America is cut with the sword we should be made to smart with the rod." (November 9, 1862)

As early as 1829, David Walker (1785-1830), a radical black abolitionist, active in Baptist churches, wrote:

"...Christian Americans not only hinder their fellow creatures, the Africans, but thousands of them will absolutely beat a colored person nearly to death, if they catch him on his knees, supplicating the throne of grace...[American preachers] have newspapers and monthly periodicals, which they receive in continual succession, but on the pages of which, you will scarcely ever find a paragraph respecting slavery, which is ten thousand times more injurious to this country than all the other evils put together; and which will BE THE FINAL OVERTHROW OF ITS GOVERNMENT, unless something is very speedily done; for THIS CUP IS NEARLY FULL. Perhaps they will laugh at, or make light of this; but I tell you Americans! that UNLESS YOU SPEEDILY ALTER YOUR COURSE YOU AND YOUR COUNTRY ARE GONE!!!!....This language, perhaps, is too harsh for the American's delicate ears. But Oh Americans!! I warn you in the name of the Lord (whether you will hear, or forbear,) to repent and reform, or YOU ARE RUINED!!!...."

Southern states responded by forbidding the teaching of reading and writing to blacks. When sin is tolerated, brushed aside, excused, or justified, it is certainly true that the Lord of Heaven will judge His people, and even whole nations that have received the light of His Scriptures. Will God continue to ignore the cries of infants who are being murdered in the womb?

CONCLUSION

This is the history that is being denied or hidden by liberals and humanists. In the second part of this study, we will see if it is possible to justify the American system of slavery from the Scriptures. And we will see that it is not inconsistent to condemn homosexuality and modern feminism, while at the same time condemning American slavery.

THE SLAVERY ARGUMENT: MARCHING TO HELL UNDER THE BANNER OF EQUAL RIGHTS (PART 2)

Liberals, homosexuals, and unbelievers do their best to paint American slavery in the antebellum South as a product of fundamental Christianity. Having laid down this false foundation, they then use it to defend homosexuality and other sinful movements against modern, Christian fundamentalism. They "conveniently" leave out the following facts that were documented in the first part of this article:

1. That the Baptists (and other fundamental Christians) were the leaders in establishing RELIGIOUS liberty (1st Amendment) in this country. Homosexuals, feminists and agnostics/atheists can thank the Baptists for the freedom to publish their falsehoods and other opinions.

2. That the institution of slavery was largely overturned due to the leadership and labor of Christians in England and America.

3. That before the 1830's, Baptists in America (and most others sects) were largely against American slavery and viewed it as immoral. Other so-called "pro-slavery" Christians, before 1830, usually saw the specific system of American slavery as only a "necessary evil" for the present time only.

4. That in the turbulent period between 1830 and 1870, popular Baptist preachers and revivalists (Spurgeon, Finney, etc.) in American and England denounced slavery and warned of Divine retribution.

5. That the LIBERAL denominations such as the Unitarians in the South were strongly pro-slavery.

6. That the Darwinian, scientific community philosophically justified slavery by teaching that blacks were the last race up the evolution ladder from the apes.

There is additional history that is likewise conveniently forgotten today by many anti-fundamentalists. In these final parts, I will therefore provide some further facts of history, and then deal with a common misinterpretation of the Scriptures which prevailed in the South in the decades directly preceding the Civil War. The desired end will be to show that, although some Christians were certainly guilty of partiality and faulty Bible interpretation, the attempt to paint American slavery as the special sin of Christian fundamentalism is ludicrous and dishonest!

THE SOUTH AFTER 1830

From 1790 to 1860, the number of slaves increased from 700,000 to 4,000,000 (even with importation forbidden after 1808)! The stakes were higher, and the South grew increasingly defensive after 1830. Before the 1830's, the anti-slavery views of most Baptists (documented in the first part of the article) was the general spirit of most political leaders who founded the country. Alexander H. Stephens (Vice President of the Confederacy), in 1861, admitted:

"The prevailing ideas entertained by him [Thomas Jefferson] and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the GENERAL OPINION of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was THE PREVAILING IDEA at that time...Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well, that this truth [that slavery of Negroes is natural, normal, and just] was NOT GENERALLY admitted, even within their day. The errors of the PAST GENERATION still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North, who STILL CLING to these errors, with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics....In the conflict thus far, success has been on our side, complete throughout the length and breadth of the Confederate States. It is upon this, as I have stated, our social fabric is firmly planted; and I cannot permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition of THIS PRINCIPLE throughout the civilized and enlightened world....May we not, therefore, look with confidence to the ultimate universal acknowledgment of the truths upon which our system rests?..."(1)

After 1830, as some Christians began to leave the area over slavery, and pro-slavery advocates strove to keep the balance of power in Congress, the South became hardened and began to openly and aggressively defend the enslavement of Africans on both "scientific" and/or "Biblical" grounds. Yet, even in the period from 1830-1865, it is foolish or dishonest to place the blame of slavery primarily on Baptists, or even fundamental Christians, in general.

ROMAN CATHOLICS AND SLAVERY

Many people today delight in rashly linking slavery with Christian fundamentalism. They usually brush aside (or bury) the fact that slavery was passionately defended by Roman Catholics and Unitarians (the darlings of most modern anti-fundamentalists). Roman Catholics such as Augustine Verot (1804-1876), the bishop of Georgia and east Florida, defended slavery on the basis that slaves were generally happier than people working in factories. Therefore, he reasoned that they were justly compensated by enslavement. He wrote that blacks were "sensual" and therefore fit for slavery. The Jesuits in Maryland (1805-1838) were generally known for treating slaves brutally. Patrick Smyth, a Roman Catholic clergyman, stated:

"...these sooty rogues will not work, unless they be goaded and whipped, and almost FLAYED ALIVE." (2)

Burke McCarty writes:

"In the 'Doctrine of the Jesuits' by Gury, translated into the French by that brilliant educator and statesman, Paul Bert in 1879, we find the position of the [Catholic] church and the Jesuits on black slavery quoted as follows: 'Slavery does not constitute a crime before any law, divine or human....When one thinks of the state of degradation in which the hordes of Africa live, the SLAVE TRADE may be considered as a providential act..."(3)

Such Jesuitical thinking had become ingrained in much of Southern thought. The Bible, on the contrary, teaches that Providence (i.e. God using, or bringing good things out of, evil actions) does not excuse the sin (Genesis 50:20, Romans 3:8, Jeremiah 25:12).

In 1842, the "New York Freeman's Journal," a leading Catholic paper (the official journal of the Bishop of New York), called ABOLITIONISTS a "mischievous set of fanatics." Ten years later (1852), this journal would reveal its true reasons for inflaming the controversy:

"No man has a right to choose his religion. Catholicism is the most intolerant of creeds. It is intolerance itself. We might as rationally maintain that two and two does not make four as the theory of Religious Liberty. Its impiety is only equaled by its absurdity."

Some of the pro-Union Catholic leaders during the war were dismissed, reprimanded, or investigated for their strange "foot-dragging" (e.g. Gen. Rosecrans, and Gen. George G. Meade, for passivity during significant battles, and Bishop Hughes for delayed action in putting down the New York Catholic riots). But aside from any Jesuit conspiracies (of which there is much evidence), history plainly reveals that Roman Catholicism was on the slavery side of the debate. No Catholic leader in America advocated abolition before the war! Abolitionists were usually very anti-Catholic, and they often likened slave-masters to Catholic priests for refusing to allow slaves to read or write. G. B. Cheever (1807-1890) linked pro-slavery Christians with the Jesuits for the mutual habit of justifying sin. He was commonly vilified in Catholic publications.

The controversial Dred Scott Supreme Court decision (1857) concluded that, not only was Scott still a slave, but that even a free Negro could not be considered a U.S. citizen. This pro-slavery decision was presented by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (1777-1864). Taney was a Maryland ROMAN CATHOLIC. His pro-slavery decision was applauded by the Catholic press, and Catholics were advised by their leaders to refrain from dissenting against the "Supreme" Court. The Catholic "New York Freeman's Journal" went so far as to accuse anti-slavery Protestants, such as G. B. Cheever, of TREASON for daring to rebuke Taney's Supreme Court decision. Cheever upbraided many of his fellow preachers and claimed that they were guilty of "mealy-mouthedness" for refusing to rebuke national sins, and for blindly interpreting the decisions of courts as if they were equal to inspired Scripture (he cited Micah 6:16 and Hosea 5:11 to show that God hates such passivity in His ministers). Abraham Lincoln soon hit the issue hard with his famous speech against Taney's Dred Scott decision (June 26, 1857). Lincoln (progressively inviting the enmity of Rome) showed that Negroes originally had the right to vote in five of the thirteen states, and therefore, "in proportion to their numbers, had the same part in making the Constitution that the white people had."

The whole Southern cause was endorsed by Rome. Charles Chiniquy claimed that Rome wanted the Civil War to DIVIDE America so religious liberty would therefore be weakened. Along this line, Thomas M. Harris, Late Brigadier General U.S.V, (1897) writes:

"In our dissensions over the questions of slavery, she [Rome] thought she saw a chance to destroy our government; and taking the side of slavery, used her whole influence, in the South, to stimulate and encourage secession and rebellion, and in the North to discredit and weaken the cause of the Union. It was G. T. Beauregard, a rabid ROMAN CATHOLIC, who first fired on the flag of our country at Fort Sumter; and let loose the dogs of war. It was the Pope of Rome, and he alone, of all the European potentates, that gave his RECOGNITION and his blessing to the Confederate government....[The] letter of the Pope to Jefferson Davis, couched in such courteous and loving terms, and showing so clearly that his sympathy was with the Southern cause, was well understood by his loyal and faithful subjects all over the North. Catholic officers began to resign and the rank and file began to desert, from the time of the publication of that letter in 1863 to the close of the war....of the 144,000 Irishmen that enlisted, 104,000 deserted...."
(Thomas M. Harris, "Rome's Responsibility for the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln," 1897)

Jefferson Davis, more than once, addressed the Pope as, "Your Holiness." He was educated in ROMAN CATHOLIC schools, like many other, pro-slavery, Southern leaders. Alexander H. Stephens (the Vice-President of the Confederacy), was educated at Locust Grove Academy, which was the first chartered Catholic school in Georgia. And the commander of the Confederate military division of the West was the militant Roman Catholic, General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, who had begun the Civil War by attacking Fort Sumter. This Roman Catholic general is known for producing the Battle Flag of the Confederacy.(4) The Confederate spy, Rose O'Neal Greenhow (who aided the Confederate victory at Bull Run) was a Roman Catholic. Robert Ould, who was the head of the Confederate Secret Service, was a Roman Catholic.(5)

Although confusion reigned, and there were good men on both sides, Roman Catholic influence was certainly on the pro-slavery side.

In past discussions with priests, etc., I have showed historical sources which document that millions of Christians have been murdered by Catholics throughout history. Unable to accuse Baptists of similar persecutions (even on the smallest scale), some Catholics accuse Baptists of being RESPONSIBLE for American slavery. They fail to mention the facts presented in this article.

SLAVERY: THE CORNERSTONE OF THE "NEW JERUSALEM"?

Israel was given special permission and authority to fulfill prophecy (Genesis 9:25) by exterminating the Canaanites and placing them under tribute (Exodus 23:24, Deuteronomy 20:17, 1 Kings 9:21). Catholic Popes, for centuries, applied these Old Testament commands directly to themselves to justify their Crusades, murders, etc. To justify adopting such specialized commands, it was necessary for Rome to define herself as the "New Israel" in a manner which allowed her the right to take up the literal sword of the state (or at least to control it). Protestant denominations that did not entirely break free from Rome's church-state system (especially those also influenced by postmillenialism), simply applied Rome's age-old techniques for their own service. This was seen in many Puritans of the "new world," who saw themselves as the "New Israel" possessing God-given authority to conquer the "Canaanites" (i.e. American Indians). This manner of interpreting Scripture (mainly Genesis 9:25) was one of the primary grounds for enslaving Negroes in the South, especially after 1830. Many Southerners, primarily from the Presbyterian, Episcopalian, etc. denominations, easily adopted Rome's "conquer the Canannite" theology, and applied it to AMERICAN SLAVES. These denominations were not wholly free from the "state church" concept. Thus, their ecclesiastical and eschatological views made it very easy to view the "new South" as God's "Theocratic Kingdom," and its governors as "Moses" or "Joshua." Enslaving Negroes was thus seen as the RIGHT of Japheth. The South would INSURE that Genesis 9:25 was fulfilled, conveniently forgetting that God often PUNISHES the rebellious, sinful instruments He uses to fulfill His curses and prophecies upon others (Jeremiah 25:9,12; 2 Samuel 12:10-11, 16:22, Matthew 26:24)!

Although Baptists were more numerous after 1830, the Presbyterians and Episcopalians in the South had more influence over the PRO-SLAVERY, political leaders. It is a fact that many of these popular, political leaders had graduated from Presbyterian academies (John C. Calhoun, etc.). Pro-slavery Presbyterian writers, such as Dabney, were the most influential. These Presbyterians had become so intoxicated by postmillennialism that they viewed America (particularly the South) as practically incapable of error, since it was a dream, "inspired by the spirit of the Prince of Peace." American slavery could not be wrong since it was "American." America was the "New Jerusalem." The pro-slavery government could not err, since it was inspired by God. Along this line, Samuel Davies Baldwin, a Methodist minister in Tennessee, wrote in defense of American slavery:

"Our country is true and faithful. It has never enacted a single law unauthorized by the Divine constitution; nor have the decisions of our supreme judiciary ever been counter to the revealed legislation of heaven."
("Dominion; or, the Unity and Trinity of the Human Race," 1858)

It is no wonder that the Catholics eyed such patriotic idolatry in the South as useful to their cause. Such postmillennial delusions have often blinded its preachers to reality and sin. Slavery was soon viewed as the very foundation of the republic! In 1835, Gov. McDuffie (S.C.), reflecting the hardening of the South, dared to call slavery, "the CORNERSTONE of our republican edifice." The idea only became more ingrained in politics. By 1861, Alexander H. Stephens (Vice President of the Confederacy) also openly declared that slavery was the FOUNDATION of the Confederacy:

"Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea [than that of the founding fathers]; its foundations are laid, its CORNER-STONE rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery - subordination to the superior race - is his natural and normal condition [Applause]. This, our new government, is THE FIRST, in the history of the world, BASED upon THIS great physical, philosophical, and moral truth....This stone which was rejected by the first builders 'is become the chief of the corner' - the real 'CORNER-STONE' - in our new edifice [Applause]."

THE INFIDEL SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS

We have already examined the evolutionists who arose in the late 1850's. The Darwinians declared Negroes the last on the human, evolutionary chain. But what did many scientists in America think of blacks (and thus, slavery) BEFORE Darwin? Before the 1830's, the common view was that all races originated from Adam and Eve. However, before long, new ethnologists (Josiah Nott, George Gliddon, etc.) began to see blacks as a "separate species," independently created. Nott and Gliddon authored, "Types of Mankind or Ethnological Research" (1854). Influenced by the German criticism of the Bible, these ethnologists (polygenists) presumptuously stated that the Bible was in error when it taught that all men came from Adam and Eve. They believed that Genesis was full of contradictions, and that it was blind to the present findings of "science." They wanted to cut the natural history of mankind loose from the Bible. This new, infidel science was embraced by many as a means to counter the anti-slavery movement. Before Darwin's infidelity of a different color, the South was already eating up the "new science" lectures of Nott and Gliddon. The influential Southern magazine, "De Bow's Review," wrote in 1850:

"If on the contrary, this assumption [that all men came from Adam and Eve] be false and groundless, these mad dreamers [abolitionists] will at once be refuted."

Josiah Nott (1804-1873) was pleased with the success of his ideas. He wrote in 1850:

"Morton is coming out dead against Moses and the prophets [i.e. monogenesis], and I think we have the game started now and will give them '_____' before we stop."

After saturating the pro-slavery South with such ideas (i.e. that blacks were not human beings!), these infidels helped set the stage for Darwin, and helped the South justify slavery. Concerning Darwin's "progression theory," Nott (advocating the plurality theory) wrote in 1860:

"The man [Darwin] is clearly crazy, but it is a capital dig into the parsons."

Thus, although he did not agree with Darwin, he was pleased that the Bible was being reproached!

This "new science" was necessary to the South. If the African could be converted to Christianity and reformed, then what right did Christians have to force them into slavery? This argument is what caused Alexander H. Stephens, in his 1861 speech, to proclaim that FORCED ENSLAVEMENT was a necessary precursor to any spiritual reformation. The new infidels (for those hardened enough against the Scriptures to embrace them), provided the necessary "science" to argue against the "Great Commission quoting" abolitionists. Since the Africans were a separate species, they were "incapable of improvement"; their so-called "condition" was "permanent." Along this line, in 1865, with his trademark, reproachful language, Nott wrote:

"God Almighty made the ' _____' , and no '______' Yankee on top of the earth can bleach him."(6)

Polygenesis did not originate with the new ethnologists. Infidel philosophers such as Voltaire (1694-1778) and David Hume (1711-1776) had earlier theorized that Negroes were a separate species. It was BIBLE CHRISTIANITY that restrained these views in the 18th century! How foolish it is, therefore, to link fundamental Christianity as the cause for American slavery! It is true that SOME true Christians justified slavery on the basis that they deemed blacks to be inferior HUMAN BEINGS. This is a far cry, however, from the philosophical and scientific view that blacks were NOT HUMAN AT ALL, but rather similar to orangutans! Therefore, much of the infidel, deist, liberal, anti-Christian science and philosophy, which we are constantly told was so "progressive" and "enlightening," must be BURIED in order to paint Christian fundamentalism as the "cause" of American slavery.

CHRISTIANS AND THE SO-CALLED BIBLE ARGUMENT

Genesis 9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

After reviewing some of the true history concerning slavery, and showing how the early philosophical forefathers and forerunners of the modern anti-fundamentalists were much more guilty than the forefathers of fundamental Christians, we can begin to examine the errors of some Christians, which we do not deny or attempt to conceal.

In the turbulent period from 1830-1860, many Christians who remained in the South and supported slavery could not bring themselves to embrace the new, infidel science. Many Southerners (to the delight of Catholics) had placed the Founding Fathers in the same camp as the infidel philosophers of the French Revolution for their views on "equality." Therefore, due to true Biblical convictions, and/or to avoid the appearance of hypocrisy, it was important for them to repel any association with the "new ethnology." Instead, they labored to find a BIBLICAL basis for enslaving Negroes. It was not uncommon in earlier centuries for some Protestant commentators to EXPLAIN the enslavement of Negroes on the basis of the curse in Genesis 9:25. The new South, as we have noted, took this one step further, and began to JUSTIFY those who enslaved the Negroes.

In the third part of this study, we will examine whether or not there is a Biblical basis to view the curse in Genesis 9 as falling upon ALL of Ham's sons. We will discuss Ham's sin, and explore the history of interpretation concerning it. We will show how so-called "corrections" (i.e. changes) in the King James Bible, the moral and intellectual state of most of the American Negroes (only a few generations removed from the uncivilized jungles - Romans 1), economic pressures, and some statements from earlier commentators, were all used in the post-1830's South to replace MISSIONARY evangelism (Matthew 28:19), with ENSLAVEMENT "EVANGELISM" (see the similar history of Augustine's interpretation of the word "compel" in Luke 14:23)! The post-1830's South did not use Ham to EXPLAIN African slavery, it used Ham to EXCUSE and PROMOTE it. For example, in 1843, Josiah Priest (1788-1851), whose writings became very popular in the South (after a detailed exposition of Ham's curse), wrote:

"Let him, therefore, who may enslave any of the Negro race do it with reverence."(7)

CONCLUSION OF PART TWO

Let all who attempt to equate modern Christian fundamentalism with American slavery simply take a few moments to reflect upon the fact that the TRUE parallel is seen in comparing anti-slavery-Christian writers in the 19th century with modern Christian fundamentalists who wish to LIBERATE babies about to be murdered in the womb, LIBERATE children about to be adopted by Sodomite parents, and LIBERATE children abandoned to day-care "prisons" (and often doped up on the latest psyche drug) by mothers "exercising their liberty to discard their children and pursue a career"! And the 19th century, PRO-SLAVERY advocates (who were often Catholic-educated, affluent, liberal, progressive, cultured, and "enlightened") had much more in common with the MODERN LIBERALS who endlessly proclaim:

-"But homosexual adoption is now LEGAL, so it can't be wrong!" (i.e. Slavery is legal so it can't be wrong);

-"Abortion is LEGAL, so it can't be wrong!" (i.e. Slavery is legal so it can't be wrong);

-"You should not reprove the government!";

-"You should keep religion out of politics!";

-"You are a bunch of unlearned fanatics!";

-"Babies in the womb are not even real human beings"! (i.e. Blacks are not real human beings, or they are created to be enslaved if we so choose);

-"The murdered babies will be happier if they do not get the chance to be born into poverty!" (i.e. Blacks will be happier if they are enslaved and rescued from the jungles);

-"Children don't even feel the effects of divorce, and they don't need both a father and a mother; and they do fine without mother all day!" (i.e. Negroes, even though they cry, do not really care about being sold away and separated from their spouses or children);

-"But what about the rights of the mother?" (i.e. But what about the rights of property owners [slave masters])?" etc.

Thus, "equal rights" were not for Negroes in the Old South, just as modern liberals and anti-fundamentalists tell us that they are not for babies in the womb, etc. "Rights" are always for the OPPRESSORS, unless the salt and light of Christianity does its work in a nation, by bold preachers proclaiming the regenerating Gospel of redemption and exposing sin. Whatever HOLY liberties are in the world today (spiritual and physical) are due to Christianity (especially fundamental Christianity). As fundamental Christianity is cast aside, oppression (of all sorts) increases. The predicted, final state of the antichristian world will endorse SLAVERY (Revelation 18:13). Let all, therefore, take heed and consider their ways! We cannot make the whole world Christian. We cannot bring in the Lord's Kingdom without the Second Coming of the King. But we can do what we can to spread the light of Gospel truth and rebuke sin while we are "occupying." God forbid that we bury our talents in the earth! Let us rebuke the modern oppressors (e.g. abortionists, homosexual predators, etc.) in the same manner as CHRISTIANS rebuked oppressors in early generations (e.g. State-church political leaders, slave-masters, etc.):

Jeremiah 22:3 Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
13 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;

Finally, let many modern Negroes consider, as they turn a deaf ear to the screams of aborted children, etc., and VOTE for pro-abortion candidates (simply to ENSLAVE themselves to more welfare on "government homesteads") - let them consider that GOD is not deaf! As in the parable of Matthew 18, He will SURELY hear from Heaven, and will judge such wicked sins:

Matthew 18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be SOLD, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy FELLOWSERVANT, even as I had pity on thee?

Did not God in His Providence and mercy hear the cries of the American Negro and use the principles of Christianity to free him from oppression? And shall you now use your influence to vote in abortionists (and such like) who KILL infants in the womb? Leave these depraved wretches who seek to USE YOU to enslave our country (you included) to tyranny! (Read what Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, and supporter of Hitler, thought about YOU! Read about her "Negro Project.") Return quickly to the God of the Holy Bible who blessed you. Flee the wicked hands that seek to destroy the FAMILY and enslave children to their depraved lusts and indoctrinations. And if they tell you that "Christian fundamentalism" once enslaved you on the basis of the "curse of Ham," just remind them that even the pro-slavery Christians (with some errors we do not excuse) nevertheless, defended you as HUMAN BEINGS made in the image of God! Then remind them that the LIBERAL, progressive, enlightened, scientific community in that day, believed that you were sub-human, and brute like the APES!

            <blockquote><strong>â€œ(<a href="http://www.health.com/" target="new">Health.com</a>)</strong> â€” Roughly two-thirds of adults and one-third of children in the U.S. are now overweight or obese. Aside from contributing to rising rates of diabetes and other chronic illnesses, this widespread weight problem also appears to be changing our perception of whatâ€™s considered heavy.

As overweight and obesity have become more common, those who are carrying unhealthy extra pounds are increasingly likely to see their weight as normal, and are therefore unlikely to feel the need to shed some of those pounds.

The latest evidence for this trend was presented Wednesday at an American Heart Association conference in Atlanta, where Columbia University researchers reported the preliminary results of a study that found that overweight mothers and children tend to underestimate their own â€” and each otherâ€™s â€” weight.Â â€A lot of their misperception has to do with the fact that overweight and obesity is becoming the norm,â€ says the lead author of the study, Nicole E. Dumas, M.D., an internal medicine resident at Columbia University Medical Center, in New Yorkâ€¦:"Â <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/03/23/obese.underestimate.weight/index.html?hpt=Sbin">http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/03/23/obese.underestimate.weight/index.html?hpt=Sbin</a></blockquote>
God judged Sodom for sins that included â€œfullness of breadâ€ and idleness (see Ezekiel). It is one thing for adults to be irresponsible with their own bodies; and it is quite another to allow children to learn this behavior and curse their health before they are able to make intelligent choices for themselves in maturity. While we can justly mock the rise of the Nanny State, the fact is that when people no longer govern themselves, it empowers others who argue that they need to be governed. Wake up Christians, and teach fasting, self-control, and wise eating.

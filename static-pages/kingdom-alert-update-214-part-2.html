THE BIBLE'S SCIENTIFIC FOREKNOWLEDGE (Part 2)
***************************************************

"There are more sure proofs of authenticity in the Bible than in any
secular history. All my discoveries have been made in answer to prayer. I
can take my telescope and look millions of miles into space; but I can go
away to my room and in prayer get nearer to God and Heaven than I can when
assisted by all the telescopes of Earth!"
-Isaac Newton (1642-1727)

Notice a review of the amazing examples of scientific foreknowledge we
noted last week:

-Differing Time Zones (daylight on one side of the world while it is dark
on the other):
-Fire beneath the earth.
-Colonies beneath the earth.
-Colonies in outer space.
-The earth hangs upon nothing.
-The Water Cycle (rivers, and evaporation)

One of the items we mentioned was in the news the next few days:

STARS TOO NUMEROUS TO COUNT
**************************************

Deuteronomy 4:19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when
thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of
heaven...

Jeremiah 33:22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand
of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant...

-Ptolemy (A.D. 127-151) counted 1056 stars.
-Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) counted 777 stars.
-Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) counted 1005 stars.
-Scientists today believe that our own galaxy alone has 100 billion stars.
The college textbook, "Young's Astronomy" in 1898 knew of nothing beyond
our own galaxy but empty space. Scientists today believe that there are
trillions of other galaxies!

Just this past week, scientists have reported:

"More stars 'than grains of sand' By David Derbyshire, Science
Correspondent (Filed: 23/07/2003) There are 10 times more stars in the
night sky than grains of sand in the world's deserts and beaches,
scientists say. Astronomers have worked out that there are 70 thousand
million million million - or seven followed by 22 zeros - stars visible
from the Earth through telescopes. The total is said to be the most
accurate estimate yet of the number of stars. Dr Simon Driver, who led the
study at the Australian National University, said: 'Even for a
professional astronomer used to dealing in monster numbers, this is mind
boggling.' Without a telescope it is only possible to see around 5,000
stars from the darkest places of the Earth, and just 100 in the middle of
a large city...." (London Telegraph)

"Star survey reaches 70 sextillion - Tuesday, July 22, 2003 - SYDNEY,
Australia (CNN)....Speaking at the General Assembly of the International
Astronomical Union meeting in Sydney, Dr Simon Driver said the number was
drawn up based on a survey of one strip of sky, rather than trying to
count every individual star. The team used two of the world's most
powerful telescopes, one at the Anglo-Australian Observatory in northern
New South Wales state and one in the Canary Islands, to carry out their
survey....He said there were likely many million more stars in the
universe but the 70 sextillion figure was the number visible within range
of modern telescopes. The actual number of stars could be infinite he
said. The universe is so big light from the other side of the universe
'hasn't reached us yet,' The Age newspaper quoted him as saying..."

IMPLANT TECHNOLOGY
***************************

Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.

"New Chip Can Be Implanted in Humans - July 18, 2003 - MEXICO CITY -
Borrowing from technology for tracking pets, a U.S. company on Thursday
launched Mexican sales of microchips that can be implanted under a
person's skin and used to confirm health history and identity. The
microchips, already available in the United States, could tap into a
growing industry surrounding Mexico's criminal concerns. Kidnappings,
robberies and fraud are common here, and Mexicans are constantly looking
for ways to protect themselves against crime. The microchip, the size of a
grain of rice, is implanted in the arm or hip. Hospital officials and
security guards use a scanning device to download a serial number, which
they then use to access blood type, name and other information on a
computer....Antonio Aceves, the director of the Mexican company in charge
of distributing the chip here, said that in the first year of sales, the
company hoped to implant chips in 10,000 people and ensure that at least
70 percent of all hospitals had the technology to read the devices. One
chip costs $150 and has a $50 annual fee. The scanning device and related
software cost $1,200. Users can update and manage their chips' information
by calling a 24-hour customer service line. Company officials said they
are working on developing similar technology that would use satellites to
help find people who may have been kidnapped. While the idea of using the
chip to track people has raised privacy concerns in the United States, the
idea has been popular with Mexicans."

WIND CIRCUITS AND OCEAN CURRENTS
********************************************
Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto
the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again
according to his circuits.

Psalms 8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet:
7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth
through the paths of the seas.

Matthew Maury (1806-1873) is called the father of oceanography:

"In 1842, he was appointed Superintendent of the Depot of Charts and
Instruments in Washington, D.C. There he was able to analyze past records
of sailing lanes and conditions of the oceans and weather. He was also
able to request ships to provide more information. From all this
information he was able to prepare the useful Pilot's Charts used by all
ships. From that day to this, every chart has a note in the margin that
Maury was responsible for them being made. The Depot of Charts and
Instruments was changed over to become the U.S. Naval Observatory, and in
1844 Matthew Fontaine Maury was its first superintendent....Records
collected by Maury on the nature of the bottom of the ocean allowed Cyrus
Field to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable, which was first
operated in 1858." (Fredericksburg Times, May 1978)

A 1923 monument to Matthew Maury in Virginia reads:

"Matthew Fontaine Maury, Pathfinder of the Seas, the genius who first
snatched from the oceans and atmosphere the secret of their laws. His
inspiration, Holy Writ, Psalms 8:8; Ecclesiastes 1:6."

"It has been reserved for one of our own countrymen to discover the paths
of the sea; to map the tracks of the winds; to shorten sailing time to
California thirty days, to Australia twenty, and to Rio Janeiro ten....The
American Franklin drew the lightning from heaven; the American Morse sent
it as an errand-boy along the oscillating wire; and now again American
genius stands confessed in high superiority, as Maury tells us 'whence the
wind cometh and whither it goeth,' and then declares that long, long ago
the Bible announced the same teachings. He has shown us that the most
exquisite proofs of perfect design and infinite skill are manifested in
ocean laws...."
("The Sea," by Eddy, Rev. T. M, "The Ladies' Repository," vol. 15, Aug
1855)

"Maury found and plotted the wind circuits and the ocean currents. The
ocean currents include, for example, the great Gulf Current - a 'path in
the sea' forty miles wide and 2000 feet deep flowing from the Gulf of
Mexico up through the Atlantic." (ICR.org)

THE MOON HAS NO LIGHT OF ITS OWN
*****************************************

Job 25:5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are
not pure in his sight.

Job 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
brightness;

The moon is always a "she" in the KJV, and the sun is always a "he." The
moon also pictures the church, and the sun pictures Christ.

***************************
WIND (AIR) HAS WEIGHT
***************************
Job 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by
measure.

"In 1640, Evagelista Torricelli discovered that air has weight. When
experimenting with measuring mercury, he discovered that air put pressure
on the mercury. Francesco Lana used this discovery to begin to plan for an
airship in the late 1600s. He drew an airship on paper that used the idea
that air has weight." (ueet.nasa.gov/)

TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY
******************************
Revelation 11:1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the
angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar,
and them that worship therein.
3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a
thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall
overcome them, and kill them.
8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which
spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations SHALL SEE
their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead
bodies to be put in graves.
10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make
merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets
tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

Robert Govett (1813-1901), who is usually years ahead of the rest of
interpreters (due to his insistence upon literal interpretation), missed
the plain words in Revelation 11:9. However, in regard to verse 10, he was
keen enough to write:

"'But how,' it is asked, 'is it conceivable, that men all over the earth
should be rejoicing at the news, when only three days and a half intervene
between their death and resurrection?' First, allowing the statement that
men over all the earth will rejoice, is it not perfectly conceivable, if
the electric telegraph shall then have extended itself at the rate it has
done of late years?" (Govett, "The Apocalypse," 1861)

"The events of the last decade of years have shown generally to expositors
of prophetic Scriptures that statements made therein should be taken
literally, where it can be done without producing absurdity - either
physical or metaphysical. Things which were, in time past, physically
impossible, are now, by the rapid progress of scientific knowledge, made
literally true. For example, let us remark on a statement by Sir Isaac
Newton [1642-1727], the great astronomer, who was also a lover of the Word
of Prophecy. He stated that the incident named in Rev. xi.10...the Beast,
ascending out of the bottomless pit, overcoming and killing the two
witness prophets, was physically impossible. In order to show that
resurrection was not possible, their dead bodies are left unburied, for
the people and kindreds and tongues and nations to see the bodies of these
prophets who had tormented the dwellers on the earth (verse 10). Gifts are
sent from the chief cities of the different nationalities to Jerusalem
from distances of several thousand miles. There would be only three and
a-half days, to send the gifts to Jerusalem to congratulate the armies on
their victory, before the two prophets are made alive. Sir Isaac Newton
calculated that from Western Europe men would have to travel at the rate
of 100 miles an hour to reach Jerusalem within the appointed time of three
and a-half days, when the two prophets would come to life and ascend to
heaven in the presence of their enemies. He, therefore, concluded that
this incident could NOT BE TAKEN LITERALLY, as it would have been
impossible at that time, and therefore, an absurdity. But today men have
learnt to travel in aeroplanes at a much greater rate, and to take letters
and gifts with them. Under present circumstances, the incident related
above can no longer be regarded as physically absurd. So the literal
interpretation of the whole of the incidents referred to must be accepted
in its plain meaning. It can no longer be held that the effects of the
Seals and the Trumpets are figurative....Most expositors have adopted the
figurative view; the only exceptions known to the writer are Seiss and
Govett. The time is rapidly approaching when these prophetic words will be
literally fulfilled."
(Joseph Sladen, "The Bride of the Lamb," in "The Dawn," 1925)

These words of Joseph Sladen (1841-1930) ironically prove the point he is
making! When he wrote this article, even he stopped short of interpreting
the prophecy (at least in verse 10) in its plainest sense. He apparently
did not conceive of VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. But the Bible's scientific
foreknowledge went beyond high speed travel (Daniel 12:4). The principle
of video would not be demonstrated in private laboratories until the late
1920's. Sladen's article appeared in "The Dawn" in 1925, and was probably
written earlier.

"I would not have any discouraged by the difficulty and ill success that
men have hitherto met with in these attempts [to understand the details of
the prophecies]. For it was revealed to Daniel that the prophecies
concerning the last times should be closed up and sealed until the time of
the end: but then, the wise should understand, and knowledge should be
increased. And therefore the longer they have continued in obscurity, the
more hopes there is that the time is at hand in which they are to be made
manifest." (Isaac Newton)

Within a few years, light would shine brighter:

"...television may make the corpses of the Witnesses in the streets of
Jerusalem - possibly even their actual conflict with Antichrist - visible
to more than merely representatives (Rev. xi.9) of the nations. 'The day
has now come,' says the Postmaster General, sir Kingsley Wood ("Times,"
Feb. 1, 1935), 'or will come this year, when, in addition to listening at
a turn of the switch to music and speech, it will be possible for many to
SEE what is happening at some distant point.'" (D. M. Panton, April 15,
1935)

"One detail in the drama is one of the most striking proofs of prophecy
ever given....TELEVISION will reproduce the corpses [of the Two Witnesses
in Revelation 11] to the ends of the earth."
(D. M. Panton, 1940)

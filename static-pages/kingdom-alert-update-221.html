*******************************************************
AN UPDATE ON GAY DAY AT THE RANGER STADIUM
********************************************************
Kingdom Baptist's "ProtestGayDay.com," thanks you for your prayers! It was
a fruitful time at the Rangers' ballpark. We will also be protesting "gay
day" at Six Flags in Arlington on Saturday, September 20th. I wrote the
following short article before we gathered at the ballpark to stand,
preach and pray:
 
WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH BY PROTESTING SIN?

1. We hope that people will see that homosexuality is a sin, and will
acknowledge their need for the Saviour Jesus.

2. We hope families will see that "everyone" does not think that
homosexuality is normal; and we hope that many (especially young teens)
will believe God's Word and flee such self-destructive sins.

3. We hope that by the news of our protest, many homosexuals will decide
to stay away from gathering for such events for the purpose of "gay
pride." Sodom was destroyed for not only committing abominations such as
homosexuality, but for also going about their daily business with no
confession of such actions as sin (Luke 17:28-29). They were proud and
haughty as they committed abominations (Ezekiel 16:50), and they would not
repent.

Baptist pastor, Ray Batema, preached the following words at a Sword of the
Lord Conference in 1976:

"In May the homosexual crowd decided they were going to have the first
world's Gay Fair in Pomona. We heard about it...We got thousands of names
signed on petitions. I preached against it. They were going to have an
Easter sunrise service. Imagine! And the pastor of the Metropolitan
Community Church of Los Angeles, which is a homosexual church, was going
to conduct the Easter sunrise services. What blasphemy! I wrote that
fellow a letter and I addressed it to the 'Perverted Pastor of the
Perverted Church of Los Angeles Looking for Prospects.' I proceeded to
tell him what the Bible said about homosexuality. Reporters from channel 2
came and stood in front of our auditorium and had a copy of the letter
that I had sent to that pastor of that church. The channel 2 broadcaster
read word-for-word on the news what I had said. They were expecting 15,000
to be there for the first world's fair for homosexuals. Sunday morning
came, the day they were to have the fair. How many people showed up? Six -
for the Easter sunrise service. The manager of the fairgrounds called my
home on Sunday morning and said, '...I want to thank you and your people.
Only about a thousand people showed up and the thing dispensed and never
finished.' He said, 'I believe it was because people of your church got
involved and made the community aware of what was happening.' And I pray
God will help us preachers to roll up our sleeves and say, 'We are not
going to let these things happen in our city. We are going to take a
stand. We are going to fight sin. We will let everybody know where we
stand.'"

The homosexual newspaper, "The Dallas Voice," recently reports:

"...he [Flores] said despite Cramer's statements, the team continues to
support efforts by the gay community groups. 'The big-wigs panic at
anything, but they're still being very supportive,' Flores said of
Rangers. Flores said staff members affiliated with the team have assured
him that 'this stuff happens' and 'it's no big deal.'...But Flores added,
'I didn't think it was going to be this big of a deal.' Although the event
has received more flak than gay community coordinators expected, 'I don't
think it's necessarily all negative,' Flores said....Flores said the
organizations had originally hoped to sell 1,000 tickets, but have pared
back their expectations. As of midweek, about 200 tickets had been sold,
he said."

We hope they do not meet their expectations, because they are coming to
this game as the event of Gay Pride week. God hates pride (Proverbs
6:16-17). Therefore, if very few come out to flaunt their sins in the face
of precious children, we will consider our protest a success. If many more
do show up, we will be saddened, yet we will be thankful for the
opportunity to convict their consciences by the preaching of Scripture."
[End of article].

The popular homosexual newspaper, the "Texas Triangle," did its best to
stir up the homosexual community to attend the game. Before the game, it
wrote:

"Not Just Any Ballgame - GLBT Texans Urged to Defy Protestors by Attending
Rangers Game - What started as just a coordinated community outing to a
Texas Rangers baseball game this Sunday has become much more thanks to
anti-gay protests now surrounding the event. Originally planned as a fun
way for GLBT Texans to spend a weekend evening, the game scheduled for the
Ballpark in Arlington has now become a unique way for gays and lesbians to
stand together, demonstrate loyalty, and still enjoy a professional
sporting event....Six North Texas organizations agreed to work with the
community center on ticket sales including the Pegasus Slow Pitch Softball
Association, the DIVA volleyball league, the gay rugby team; the North
Texas Women's Sports Association, next year's gay softball World Series
committee known as Series 2004, and the Texas Gay Rodeo Association. Each
group will receive revenue from the ticket sale profits. Offering a unique
outing, while raising some much-needed money for local non-profits, was
the intent of the visit to this Sunday's ballgame for Flores and the
community center. Creating controversy was not on the agenda for the gay
organizations. But for Richard Warden, a member of Kingdom Baptist Church
in Venus Texas, news of the 'Gay Day' as part of the national past-time
deserved a response. Warden created a website called
protestgayday.com....[Flores] is hoping GLBT Texans will rally to buy
tickets and show up at the game to sit in the reserved sections. 'Ticket
sales are going well,' said Flores....'I think this event could grow if
the community gets out there and supports it,' said Flores noting that
attendance in general has been down for the Rangers this year due to their
performance on the field. 'If they only have 5000 people attend and we're
able to sell 2000 tickets, we would have a lot of leverage with the
organization. After all, it's their business to sell as many tickets as
possible.' Flores also points out that buying tickets for Sunday's game
will prove the consumer loyalty so often touted with regard to the GLBT
community. 'It is important that we buy tickets. We haven't made this
political and through this entire situation, the Rangers have been very
supportive. We need to show some loyalty in return. If we want equal
rights, we have to support those who treat us as equals,' said Flores.
'The Rangers said they are not going to discriminate even though they've
been bombarded by the right wing...."

Concerned Women for America ( http://www.cwfa.org ) provides a good report
of what actually occurred:

"Texas Rangers 'Gay Day' a Bust - 9/17/2003 - By Martha Kleder - Christian
protesters outnumber homosexual attendees at The Ballpark - The 8 by 4
foot neon green sign outside the Texas Rangers' Arlington stadium near
Dallas on Sunday night proclaimed the outcome: 'Christians 300, 'Gays'
200, Jesus wins.' That was the final score as Christians rallied outside
the stadium in protest of what was billed in the media as 'Gay Day at The
Ballpark.' Those 300 protesters included members from two local churches
on hand to pray and witness and 100 who bused in from Heritage Baptist
Church in Mount Enterprise, Texas, 180 miles away. Despite claims from the
Resource Center of Dallas that they would draw 1,000 homosexual baseball
fans to Sunday night's game, the group was able to sell only 200 tickets
for the special roped-off section. 'This is a victory,' Rick Warden told
CWA's Culture and Family Institute. 'This was a larger victory than simply
protesters outnumbering homosexuals.' Warden heads
"http://www.protestgayday.com", an organization formed to speak out
against the tide of homosexual acceptance. 'This victory included winning
the battle in the media for the attention of Christians who have grown
complacent. It included persuading two couples attending with children in
tow to skip the game and join the protest,' he said. 'Three young men were
led to Christ, and another couple of men who were headed to the game
decided to stay away that night because of the promotion of homosexuality
scheduled for that night,' Warden added.

'You have caught the attention of people across the nation'

'But aside from the three who accepted Christ, the best news of the night
was an e-mail that was waiting for me when I returned home,' he said. The
e-mail, which came from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, reads in part:

'Thank you for your example of courage, conviction, and love. After the
event in Arlington this evening, do not let the energy and momentum fade.
You have caught the attention of people across the nation, and you have
begun to unite Christians like myself who are waiting for an opportunity
to come to the front lines of battle, to proclaim the saving grace of
Jesus Christ.'

The battle over 'Gay Day' is not over for Warden. This coming weekend, Six
Flags Over Texas will hold its annual 'Gay Day,' and the Dallas area will
hold its 20th annual 'Gay Pride' Parade; now renamed 'The Alan Ross Texas
Freedom Parade.' Warden says that he and several supporters will be on
hand to protest the homosexual event at Six Flags.

It apparently started with a sales rep

Meanwhile, there has been much controversy over how the Texas Rangers 'Gay
Day' came into being. It appears to have boiled down to a new salesman who
had previous dealings with homosexual groups. 'A sales representative who
helped organize last year's Gay Day for the Dallas Burn, the city's major
league soccer team, now works for the Rangers and brought the idea for Gay
Day at The Ballpark with him,' Gil Flores, services director for the John
Thomas Gay and Lesbian Community Center, told 'The Dallas Voice,' the
regional homosexual newspaper. The Rangers acknowledge that their
representative made the outreach, but they say that it was a routine
matter. Rangers owner Mike Cramer has denied in numerous interviews that
'Gay Day at The BallPark' exists. He noted that the Rangers simply sold a
block of tickets to the homosexual group, just as they have sold tickets
to other groups, including some with religious affiliations. 'The Rangers
could have nixed this block sale if they wanted,' said Robert H. Knight,
director of CWA's Culture and Family Institute. 'Their explanation that
they offer this to anybody and everybody does not wash. Any group
promoting sexual perversity should be considered beyond the pale. And
comparing sales to religious groups is an insult. You mean they can't tell
the difference between, say, the First Baptist Church and a group that
promotes homosexual sodomy? 'We believe the Rangers, as a private
organization, have the right to make this offer, but we also believe that
Mr. Warden and his supporters are within their rights to call it to the
public's attention and to let Ranger fans decide whether it's fine for
their team to tacitly promote homosexuality,' Knight said.

Not as bad as Philly

'Gay Day' at the Arlington stadium is a far cry from the blatant promotion
of homosexuality at a recent Philadelphia Phillies game. There, homosexual
groups were welcomed on the scoreboard, the leader of the homosexual group
threw out the first pitch, and homosexuals brought banners and cavorted
during the game. By contrast, the Rangers held no field activities or
official acknowledgements during the September 14th game against Oakland.
'Watching this controversy unfold, I think the Rangers hit a foul ball,'
Knight said. 'If there truly was no 'Gay Day' at Arlington, why didn't the
team's front office call for the homosexual press to correct this
impression? 'Like many Americans today, they seem unnecessarily fearful of
offending the homosexual lobby. Texas is legendary for its people's
courage. In fact, Texans are quite fond of the phrase, 'one riot, one
ranger,' referring to the grit of the Texas Rangers lawmen. 'Texas is home
to the Alamo. Would Davey Crockett and the other defenders of the Alamo
identify today with Rick Warden, or with the 'gays' who made their
sexuality everybody's business at The Ballpark?'" (Concerned Women for
America, 1015 Fifteenth St. N.W., Suite 1100
Washington, D.C. 20005)

The following report is reported on World Net Daily in today's morning
edition:

"ProtestgayDay.com declares victory: Group goes after Texas Rangers,
demonstrates at Six Flags - Fresh off what he considers a major victory in
a fight against "Gay Day" at the Ballpark in Arlington, home of the Texas
Rangers, the head of ProtestGayDay.com has organized a demonstration today
at [Six Flags] in Dallas. According to a statement from organizer Rick
Warden, supporters will be protesting the theme park's sixth annual "Gay
Day" beginning at 9:30 a.m. local time. On Sunday, ProtestGayDay.com
declared victory in its protest of what had been billed, at least in some
publications, as a "Gay Day" at the Ballpark in Arlington. The group
claims due to pressure applied via the media, only 200 tickets were
purchased by homosexuals for Sunday's baseball game. "We praise God that
through the media we were able to detour the homosexuals from buying the
tickets and therefore also from being recognized in front of thousands of
families and nation wide television," said the group's website.
ProtestGayDay.com says 2,200 signatures were gathered on a petition in
protest of what it says were plans to recognize homosexuals at the game.
The site also rebuts statements from Rangers officials that the team had
not planned for an official "Gay Day": "Mike Cramer, who is the president
of operations with the Texas Rangers organization, has repeatedly refused
to address the article in the Dallas Voice newspaper (a homosexual
publication) stating, 'Gay Day at the Ballpark will be the first time a
major professional athletic team has reached out to the gay community and
offered to help organize such an event.'" The group called on the Rangers
to hold the paper accountable if the quote attributed to Cramer were
untrue. ProtestGayDay.com sent an e-mail to Cramer referencing the Six
Flags protest: "'Gay Day' at Six Flags Over Texas is Saturday 9-20-03.
These people are counting on the fact that we Christians are too busy
entertaining ourselves to stand up to them and do anything about having
'Gay Day.' Until now they've been right in their assumption. We Christians
have had a great awakening. We repent of our sins. We are committed to
Jesus Christ to stand and be active." The group formed specifically to
protest the Rangers' "Gay Day." In its mission statement, it states: "The
Texas Rangers have a responsibility as a sports team, that children look
toward as role models, to act on the behalf of and in the best interest of
their fans. This event legitimizes the perverted homosexual lifestyle in
the eyes of the unsuspecting innocent child. Homosexual are still very
much a minority group and families will not sit back and let them take
over our communities. The Texas Rangers should be ashamed." Besides
today's protest, the organization is battling a plan by Dallas-Fort Worth
area Starbucks to donate funds to a "Gay Pride" parade scheduled for
tomorrow, encouraging members to protest outside the coffee houses."
(http://www.worldnetdaily.com/, September 20th, 2003)
 
We are thankful to AFA, CWA, and WND, and others, for their help in
promoting these events. In closing this update, I would like to say that
we certainly do not think that Christians can convert the world before the
return of Christ. We know that the Bible teaches that times will be
perilous in the last days. But we also know that the times will be
perilous BECAUSE many Christians will not shine their light and they are
no longer willing to testify to the world that its deeds are evil (John
7:7). While the world continues to slip into hell, let it not be because
of our apathy. Let it not be because we are lovers of pleasures more than
lovers of God. Let us do what we can, while we can. It is "Gay Day"
today...It will be "Pedophile Day" tomorrow!

***********************************************************************
IN DEFENSE OF THE A.V. AND LITERAL INTERPRETATION: HONEY FROM A ROCK
************************************************************************

Preterism (i.e. the erroneous view that the Book of Revelation has already
been fulfilled in past history), will likely grow increasingly popular.
Scoffers must arise (2 peter 3:3). It is therefore important to notice
that while the Bible does at times use allegory, it is not as allegorical
as sinful man would like to believe it is! The golden rule of Biblical
interpretation is to interpret Bible words as literal and normal as
possible, unless there are compelling, Biblical reasons to interpret them
otherwise. Too often, a figurative interpretation (or worse, a total
retranslation) is appealed to in order to understand certain Scriptures.
This is unfortunate. A little study, a little comparing Scripture with
Scripture, a little faith in God, will often go a long way in helping us
to understand the Bible. But many scholars will hastily assume that a
passage cannot be taken literally. We all admit that there are wonderful
spiritual and devotional applications that can be gleaned from allegorical
and literal Scriptures. However, too often the literal interpretation is
wholly deleted in the process! This practice can have devastating
consequences upon Bible doctrine, especially in regard to Bible prophecy.

Having examined Job 21:24 in the first article of this series, let us now
notice another set of Bible verses that are often wrongly spiritualized to
the denial of their literal truth:

Deuteronomy 32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that
he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck HONEY OUT
OF THE ROCK...

Psalms 81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat:
and with HONEY OUT OF THE ROCK should I have satisfied thee.

Does honey literally come out of a rock? The so-called "Living Bible"
comes to the rescue in Psalms 81:16, and reads: "He would satisfy you with
honey for the taking." Others simply interpret such verses as figurative
poetry. Yet, there is no reason not interpret these verses literally.

Can honey flow out of a rock? Certainly, if God can make water flow from a
rock, He can causes rocks to bring forth honey. However, before appealing
to a direct miracle, we must simply ask what the words "out of" really
mean. Do they refer to the rock as a DIRECT source, or do they refer to
the rock as an INDIRECT source? This is the important question. If the
rock is only an INDIRECT source, it is STILL a source, and the Scripture
is still literal. Notice the following Scripture:

Deuteronomy 33:14 And for the precious fruits BROUGHT FORTH BY THE SUN,
and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
15 And for the chief things OF the ancient mountains, and for the precious
things of the lasting hills,

The "precious fruits" are "brought forth" by the sun. This simply means
that the sun plays a role in the growth of the fruit. In the same way, the
rock plays a role in the production of honey. The rocks are where the bees
in that area of the world place their hives:

Isaiah 7:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and
for THE BEE that is in the land of Assyria.
19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
valleys, and IN THE HOLES OF THE ROCKS, and upon all thorns, and upon all
bushes.

Therefore, the honey does indeed literally come "out of" the rocks. The
fact that the honey comes directly from the bees does not change the fact
that the rocks can still be said to be a source. For example, WINE (grape
juice) comes directly from grapevines. However, since grapes can grow on
mountainsides, the wine can be said to come from the mountains as an
indirect, yet literal source:

Amos 9:13 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and
THE MOUNTAINS SHALL DROP SWEET WINE, and all the hills shall melt.
14 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they
shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall PLANT
VINEYARDS, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and
eat the fruit of them.

Therefore, honey from rocks, is no different than goats from rocks:

Job 39:1 Knowest thou the time when the WILD GOATS OF THE ROCK bring
forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

This is not allegorical language. Goats are goats. They are "of" the rock
because they LIVE among the rocks. Honey is "out of the rock" because it
FLOWS from among the rocks. The Bible calls the land of Canaan, a LAND
flowing with "milk and honey" (Exodus 3:8, etc.). The land itself is not
the direct source of either milk or honey. Bees make honey (though from
the flowers, etc.) and goats, cows, camels, etc. produce milk. But since
bees and cows are found ON the LAND, the land is indeed, LITERALLY flowing
with both milk and honey. Many other examples of this type of language
could be cited.

It remains to simply demonstrate that in the Middle East, honey can
literally flow down out of the rocks. Samson found honey in a dead lion.
And we should remember that Jonathan found honey lying on the ground (1
Samuel 14:25). The note on this Scripture from Torrey's "Treasury of
Scripture Knowledge," is insightful:

"This was wild honey, which to this day abounds in Judea; and bursting
from the comb, runs down the hollow trees, ROCKS, etc."

A popular, Bible dictionary writes:

"All travelers agree in describing Palestine as a land 'flowing with
honey' (Ex.iii.8), bees being abundant even in the remote parts of the
wilderness, where they deposit their honey in THE CREVICES OF THE ROCKS or
in hollow trees..." (William Smith, "A Dictionary of the Bible," 1863)

Spurgeon notes:

"...the very rocks of the land would yield abundant and sweet supplies;
the bees would store the clefts of the rocks with luscious honey, and so
turn the most sterile part of the land to good account."("Treasury of
David")

John Duns writes:

"Most travelers who have visited Palestine in summer have had their
attention directed to the abundance of honey, which the bees of the land
have stored up in the hollows of trees and in crevices of the rock.  In
localities where the bare rocks of the desert alone break the sameness of
the scene, and all around is suggestive of desolation and death, the
traveler has God's care of his chosen people vividly brought to mind, as
he sees the honey which the bees had treasured up beyond his reach,
trickling in shining drops down the face of the rock." ("Treasury of
David")

Another (non-theological) writer agrees:

"Owing to its numerous wild-flowers, and flowering shrubs, Palestine has
always been a famous country for bees. They deposit their honey in hollow
trees, as our bees do when they escape from the hive, and IN HOLES IN THE
ROCKS, as ours do not. In a tropical or semi-tropical climate, bees are
quite apt to take refuge in the rocks..."
(John Burroughs, "Locusts and Wild Honey," 1879)

Understanding how the Bible communicates in the Old Testament will help us
understand the New Testament. We have seen that "honey out of rocks" does
not mean that bees do not play their part. In the same manner, practical
godliness, worked in Christians by God's Spirit, does not mean that
Christians are lifeless robots. A Christian must trust God and then fight
sin. There is an effeminate, passive, SATANIC movement that teaches that
the Christian life is to be lived by simply "letting go and letting God,"
in total dreamy apathy. This has destroyed the testimony and shipwrecked
multitudes of saints. Once a person has assurance of salvation based on
Christ's Blood, and they are clear concerning the Gospel (i.e. they are
not trying to work for eternal salvation), it is time to WORK for the
prize of the high calling. The Christian life is likened unto a fight. It
is a race. It is war. There will at times be blood, sweat, tears and
suffering to break Satanic strongholds (i.e. evil habits, etc.). But all
this warfare is denied on the basis that the Scriptures often show GOD as
the source of the Christian life. But God saves sinners to renew them in
spirit, soul and body. And "sanctification" without the will and mind
involved is mysticism, not Christian sanctification. The fact that
commands are addressed to the mind and will of believers shows that the
mind and will of believers must be involved. Let us therefore cast aside
any teaching that seeks to encourage apathy and non-involvement in the
pursuit of holiness.

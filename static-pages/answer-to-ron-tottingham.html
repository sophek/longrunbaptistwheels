        <h1>ANSWERS TO RON TOTTINGHAM</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Ron Tottingham, the pastor of Empire Baptist Temple, has written a review of my book 'The Rod: Will God Spare It." This review was printed in the Flaming Torch in 2003. Brother Tottingham begins his objections as follows:

"J. D. Faust is universal church and miss-apply many verses due to this doctrinal position."

I suppose that what he is trying to say in English is that I hold to the doctrine of a universal church, and that I misapply many verses because of this position. But Tottingham has misrepresented my view. I believe that the word "church" is used in the Bible for the local church, and that at times it speaks of this word in a singular sense, in the same manner as it does "the bed" (Hebrews 13:4) of holy marriage (though there be many such beds). Not only has he misrepresented my position on the local church (providing no verses to prove his assertion), but he also fails to show in what specific manner a person's view of the church (i.e. local only, or local and universal) has to do with the subject of MILLENNIAL EXCLUSION. My book certainly documents the scores of writers who believed in a universal church who held to my position. Yet, my book also quotes men such as J. R. Graves, who was much closer to my position that Tottingham's position! I quote Graves (after his stroke at age 65, when he was confined to bed and could do nothing but study) in my book as follows:

"Not to all Christians can He say, well done, good and faithful servants....These five unwise virgins were not enemies of Christ, hypocrites under the guise and profession of friends. All that is said of them implies that they represent Christians as certainly as the wise ones...From all this we learn that it is one thing to be barely saved, which every Christian will ultimately be, but quite another thing to be honored with the prize of our high calling.â€¦How few ministers can brook the least persecution for the truths sake! Will such ever enter the Kingdom or wear a crown?...Since the slothful servant is made the most prominent character in the parable, and since so many expositors misteach and destroy its whole scope and true intent, I will give him my first and special attention: 1. He was, like the rest, his Master's 'own servant'â€¦.If his other servants represent Christians, so must this servant also....He was denied the resplendent honours and joys awarded to the faithful ones, and suffered grievous chastisement, which is indicated by the phrases 'outer darkness' and 'gnashing of teeth.'..."

Graves' writings spawned multitudes of Baptist churches that applied "outer darkness" to true believers. Therefore, the idea of Tottingham's, that the "local church only" position will naturally lead one to reject Kingdom Exclusion makes no sense at all. As we can see in the later writings of Graves, it logically leads to this position. It allows the warnings in Christ's parables, to His disciples, to be made applicable to modern Christians, since it sees the disciples as "the church."

Tottingham then continues:

"Also, he holds that every mention of 'kingdom' refers to the millennium which is not so. See John 3:3, 5."

This is another misrepresentation, as can be clearly seen by simply reading my chapter called, "Millennial Counterfeits." Yet, Tottingham does not prove that the "kingdom" in John 3:3,5 is NOT the Millennium. Nicodemus, as a Jewish leader among the Pharisees, would have certainly understood the word "kingdom" in the same light as the disciples understood it in in Acts 1:

Acts 1:6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again THE KINGDOM to Israel?

Tottingham has been influenced by Romanism and Protestantism more than he realizes. Our Lord words to Nicodemus teach that the NEW BIRTH is the FIRST and foremost qualification for entrance into the Millennial Kingdom. This is why the blind Pharisees, who rejected the testimony of John against themselves, and the new birth, would be shut out of the Millennium (Matthew 21:31, etc.). The Millennial Kingdom is the NEXT kingdom in prophecy, and therefore it occupies the largest place on the eschatological horizon. Tottingham has proved nothing. Yet, he has misrepresented my position in the first two sentences of his objection.

Next, Tottingham writes:

"He continues this line of application with Matthew 7:21 (Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.) and 19:23-24 (Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.) when he says the kingdom mentioned in these verses is the millennium. No other Bible interpreter that I'm aware of interprets these in this way nor do I. I hold these verses to speak about salvation or entering heaven."

This doctor says he is unaware of any other Bible interpreter that believes the "kingdom" in the above verses is the Millennium. This simply proves that, not only will many Christians today not READ, they will not even read if someone else does the homework for them! I listed MULTITUDES of "Bible interpreters" in the book. Has the doctor never heard of any of these men? Did he happen to MISS the last half of my book? If Tottingham believes that the Kingdom "of Heaven" IS HEAVEN, does he also believe that John's baptism, which was "OF HEAVEN" is Heaven itself? Does he likewise believe that the "kingdom OF GOD" is GOD HIMSELF? Tottingham is not ready to debate Millennial Exclusion. He needs to first get grounded in good old-fashioned PREMILLENNIALISM. I recommend that he read the three volumes by George N. H. Peters, called "The Theocratic Kingdom." It has been reprinted by Kregel. It is no wonder that postmillennialism and preterism are gaining so much ground when independent Baptists such as Tottingham think the "kingdom of Heaven" means Heaven or "salvation." Tottingham must obviously advocate "Lordship salvation" since he interprets our Lord's warnings to His disciples, concerning the Kingdom, to refer to eternal salvation itself.

Tottingham writes:

"This book's main theme though is built around the idea of a 'Christian purgatory.'"

I believe that purgatory is a fable of men. There is no such place, Roman, Christian, or otherwise. My book is "built around" the fact that there is a literal Kingdom coming, and to enter this Kingdom one must first be born again, and he must also be judged faithful at the Lord's coming.

Tottingham writes:

"And we are told that the view of the book is that Christians will go into outer darkness."

No, we are told that UNFAITHFUL CHRISTIANS who do not repent when they are warned will go into outer darkness.

Tottingham writes:

"Then when he is presenting all this he says that 'there is therefore a sense in which carnal Christians do not have the spirit of Christ dwelling fully within them.' (P.132) Does the Bible teach a partial dwelling of the Holy Spirit within one saved? 'But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.' Romans 8:9. This editor thinks not."

This man has some trouble with the English language. When it is said that there is a SENSE in which carnal Christians do not have the spirit of Christ dwelling fully within them, this does not mean that there is ONLY a partial dwelling; for it would also mean that there is ANOTHER SENSE in which the Holy Spirit is dwelling believers. I would ask Tottingham, DO ALL CHRISTIANS KNOW JESUS? If they do, then why did Paul say that his great desire, at the END of his ministry was to KNOW HIM (Phil.3:10)? And I would also ask Tottingham another very simple question: IF THERE IS NO SENSE IN WHICH A BELIEVER CAN BE ONLY PARTIALLY FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT, THEN WHY ARE CHRISTIANS COMMANDED TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT (Ephesians 5:18)?

Tottingham writes:

"If Faust is saying all who are members of churches are Christian he is most certainly deceived or taking the broad evangelical position on salvation."

Faust does not believe that everyone who is a member of the local church is necessarily born again. However, I do believe that everyone addressed directly by Jesus under the term "church" in the Book of Revelation IS BORN AGAIN. John writes:

Revelation 1:4 John to the seven CHURCHES which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and WASHED US from our sins in his own blood,
6 And hath made US kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

The Lord Jesus warns saints to overcome THROUGH SUFFERING. A lost sinner is not born again through suffering.

Tottingham writes:

"Faust puts Saints in hell for unrighteousness that leaves this issue of doctrine out."

No, I plainly believe that Christians are in danger for being excluded for HERESIES (Galatians 5:20).

Tottingham writes:

"Faust presents unholy living from the moral, social realm as the standard by which the Lord will place some true Christians into hellâ€™s fire for the 1000 millennium. If the Bible did show such, and I do not believe it does, it would be based on doctrinal purity (1 Tim 1:10; 2 Tim 1:13; 3:16; 4:2-4)."

No, it would be (and IS) based on what the Bible SAYS it is based on. People miss the Kingdom of God for more than doctrine. Read the lists in Ephesians 5, Galatians 5 and 1 Corinthians 6.

Tottingham writes:

"Faust clearly claims that the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory is a historic error, a corruption of what is found in true doctrine that the Lord gave to early Christians. But holds that it is true and says 'Purgatory then is a perversion of truth instead of a whole new creation.' (P.164)"

What in the world does "but holds that it is true" mean here? If I hold that it is error, then I do not hold that it is true. If Tottingham believes the NIV is a "perversion" of the AV (as I do), does this mean that he "holds that it [the NIV] is true"?

Tottingham writes:

"Following this Faust misinterprets some parables that are clearly (to me) Jew vs Gentile in teaching. He interprets them to be believers and where the Lord warns the Jewish nation of judgement, Faust applies to polluted Christians."

If these parables are so "clearly" written to Jews only (with no application to Christians in any age) then why didn't he show us this "clear" evidence. If it is so clear, then why did he put "to me" in parenthesis? Jesus certainly speaks to Tribulation Jews in the Olivet Discourse (i.e, "let them which be in Judaea"), but He also speaks to Christians (the apostles, the foundation of the church):

Matthew 24:42 Watch therefore: for YE know not what hour YOUR Lord doth come.
43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

And if it is maintained that the Lord was only speaking to the Jews, when speaking to His disciples, one must still deal the fact that He later plainly commands the disciples to teach the GENTILE CHRISTIANS all the things He had taught them (Matthew 28).

Finally, Tottingham writes:

"On Page 226 he tells us that there are two aspects of eternal life, that there is dualism in the words. He then explains this dualism as absolute eternity and future eternal life after the millennium which he calls 'relative eternal life' in the kingdom (millennium) of God. Oh Wow! Then a biggie - 'In the above passages 'eternal life' is through works.' (P.227)"

Eternal life (in the fullest sense of eternity) is absolutely by grace through faith alone. However, that there is another aspect of eternal or everlasting life that is granted through obedience (which I apply to the Millennium) has been seen, by not only the multitudes of writers I quote in my book, but also by others who did not see or understand Kingdom Exclusion as presented in my book. For example Jack Hyles in such works as, "Salvation Is More Than being Saved," and many other preachers throughout the ages have written that there is an aspect of "everlasting life" that applies to more than initial justification, and that it is experienced through obedience. If Tottingham is shocked, we would love to hear his in-depth exposition of Galatians 6:6-9. Enlighten us on the meaning doctor.

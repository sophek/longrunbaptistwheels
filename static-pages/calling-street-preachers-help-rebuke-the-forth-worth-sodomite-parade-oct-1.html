God destroyed Sodom for this wickedness. It is shame when a city  degrades itself to give approval to such filth. What will be next? We  pray that every God fearing person will rebuke this immorality, for the  sake of truth and for the children. These perverts cannot reproduce.  That is why they need to use every occasion to promote their  uncleanness.

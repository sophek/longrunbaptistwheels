Part II:Â 

-SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUMBER 666Â 

============================================Â 
RACING TOWARD THE MARK OF THE BEAST!!Â 
As we begin to enter a new year (i.e. 2003), there are so many events occurring that are setting the stage for the rapture and the Tribulation period, that there is no way to even begin to discuss them all in one night. While Israel has returned to its land in unbelief and is waiting to build its temple in fulfillment of prophesy, the rest of the nations are lining up for the events at the start of the Tribulation period. This message will be limited to only one amazing preparation for the Tribulation period that has been taking place. While so many are slumbering unawares, the technology to LITERALLY fulfill the Mark of the Beast prophecy in Revelation 13 has not only been developed, it is currently being SOLD to the public!Â 
Notice the prophecy in Revelation 13:Â 
Revelation 13:17 And that no man might BUY OR SELL, save he that had the MARK, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Â 

MARK: "To make an INCISION; as to mark sheep or CATTLE by cuts in their ears." (Webster's Dictionary, 1828)Â 

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Â </span>
The wisest premillennial commentators have predicted that this Scripture will be fulfilled LITERALLY:Â 

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Â </span>
Robert Govett (1843): "Is the Mark literal? Yes...How can it be any other than a LITERAL mark?...It is something which is to be shown in the market..." ("Revelation: Literal and Future")
Â 
As a young child at a YMCA camp, I once heard about future computer technology that would one day be able to track everyone in the world financially by a number. The people in those days who said that we would soon have the technology to implant a chip were viewed as fanatics:Â 
Luke 24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:Â 
As this technology has developed, so has Big Government which will seek to control it:Â 
G. H. Lang (1945): "We of today should take serious note of the powerful centralizing motion of society all over the earth. More and more does authority pass to officials....General regulations increase in number and scope, DESIGNED AT FIRST<strong> </strong>to meet critical social conditions, AS IN A TIME OF WAR.<strong> </strong>National registration, central food control...all work in the direction of that final and detailed control of the masses [by Antchrist]." ("The Revelation")
Â 
The way in which these things are implemented is by first producing a bill that exaggerates the true goal. Then when public outcry defeats the outrageous bill, a new bill with the DESIRED AGENDA is readily accepted with RELIEF and thanksgiving! Unless the Lord intervenes in longsuffering, we will continue to race, not only toward the Mark, but toward the totalitarian world government which will use it to COMFORT the people.Â 
The King James Bible (1611) has been the only translation to reveal that the future "mark" will not only be upon the body, it will also be IN the body!:Â 
Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark IN their right hand, or IN their foreheads:Â 
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. (KJV)
Â 
"...be given them a mark ON their right hand, or UPON their forehead." (ASV)Â 
"...be marked ON their right hand or the forehead." (RSV)Â 
"...to receive a mark ON his right hand or ON his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark..." (NIV)Â 
"....to be given a mark ON their right hand, or ON their forehead..." (NAS)Â 
"...to receive a mark ON their right hand or ON their foreheads..." (NKJV)Â 
"...to have a mark placed ON their right hands and ON their foreheads." (Good News)Â 
"He required everyone...to be TATTOOED with a certain mark ON the right hand or ON the forehead..." (Living Bible)Â 
"...to be marked with an inscription (stamped) ON their right hands or ON their foreheads." (Amplified)Â 
"...to be given a stamped image ON their right hands or their foreheads." (Catholic New American Bible)Â 
With this light from the KJV, notice the new words and phrases that new technology has created: HUMAN ID CHIPS, IMPLANTED CHIPS, IMPLANTABLE CHIPS, INJECTABLE CHIPS, IDENTITY CHIPS, INTERNAL CHIPS, SUBDERMAL CHIPS, TRACKER CHIPS, IMPLANTABLE MICROCHIPS, IMPLANTABLE MONITORS, HUMAN MICROCHIPPING, IMPLANT TAGS, TRACKING IMPLANTS, etc.Â 
It is later than you think. This is no time to be settled down in sin and compromise! Now notice an ad from Applied Digital Solutions website:Â 
"'Getting CHIPPED' is a simple, outpatient procedure that lasts just a FEW MINUTES and involves only local anesthetic and INSERTION of the chip." (Applied Digital Solutions Web Site, ADSX.com)Â 
The website has a cute little "Benji" dog on the front page.Â 
Now read the following paragraph describing GPS technology:Â 
"Global Positioning System: The Global Positioning System (or GPS) is a collection of satellites owned by the U.S. Government that provides highly accurate, worldwide positioning and navigation information, 24 hours a day. It is made up of twenty-four NAVSTAR GPS satellites that orbit 12,000 miles above the earth, constantly transmitting the precise time and their position in space." (ptm.com)Â 
With this background and understanding, we are now ready to specifically document the incredible stage-setting for the Mark of the Beast that has occurred in this past year. When reading these news reports, understand that reporters usually set up a straw dummy and state the fundamentalist position in the extreme. They will write something to the effect of: "A FEW religious groups think this is the mark of the beast." Any fool can knock this dummy down. They will not state it like this: "MANY religious groups think this technology is rapidly SETTING THE STAGE for the fulfillment of Revelation 13, which predicts a totalitarian world government that will attempt to forbid the buying and selling of every human being without some kind of implanted mark." But this is to be expected. Prayerfully notice the amazing developments in 2002. (Caps have been inserted for emphasis. My comments follow some news reports):Â 
January 8, 2002: "The government is working with the states to develop a new generation of driversâ€™ licenses that could be checked anywhere and would contain electronically stored information such as fingerprints for the countryâ€™s 184 million licensed drivers..." (AP)Â 
January 23, 2002: "(CNN) Microchip implants may save lives one day - It sounds almost like a plot line from 'Star Trek' - a patient's life is saved thanks to a TINY MICROCHIP<strong> </strong>IMPLANTED in his body that lets a doctor detect a dangerous condition before it becomes critical...The work is still in the early stages, so researchers will have to watch for potential risk factors - the chip dislodging, or the body having some kind of REACTION to the plastic used to make the sensor. But they envision few complications..."
Â 
January 26, 2002: "'Digital Angel' set to fly soon - IMPLANT technology to be beta tested on humans - beginning July 15, Applied Digital Solutions will begin beta testing on humans an implant technology...Law enforcement may employ the implant to keep track of criminals...'Ideally,' the patent states, 'the device will bring PEACE OF MIND....Referring to the threat of kidnapping, the patent goes on to say '...children who may be at risk of being kidnapped, will reap NEW FREEDOMS...We have received requests daily from around the world for the product...American soldiers may be required to wear the implant....ADS has received complaints from Christians and others who believe the implant could be the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. But Zhou dismisses such objections to the implant. 'I am a Christian, but I don't think [that argument] makes sense,' he told WND. 'The purpose of the device is to save your life and improve the quality of life. There's no connection to the Bible. There are different interpretations of the Bible. My interpretation is, anything to improve the quality of life is from God....A few years ago there may have been resistance, but not anymore,' he continued. 'PEOPLE ARE GETTING USED TO HAVING IMPLANTS. NEW CENTURY, NEW TREND...." (WND)
Â 
February 6, 2002: "They Want Their ID CHIPS NOW...Meet the Jacobs family...They could become the first family in the world to be implanted with microchips..." (Wired News)Â 
February 25, 2002: "I Chip? Technology to Meld Chips into Humans Draws Closer -
It's 10 p.m. You may not know where your child is, but the chip does. The chip will also know if your child has fallen and needs immediate help....And the interest in testing embedded chips has been steadily increasing - especially since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Dr. Richard Seelig, a former surgeon but now a medical consultant for ADS, became the first to embed a VeriChip in his arm and hip on Sept. 16...." (Abcnews.com)Â 
February 4, 2002: "Under criticism by privacy advocates, as well as Christians concerned over the biblically prophesized 'mark of the beast,' the Nasdaq-traded company REMOVED ALL REFERENCES TO HUMAN IMPLANTATION<strong> </strong>from its website. Its CEO claimed publicly that there were 'no plans' to make the technology IMPLANTABLE, but rather for the user to 'wear' the device outside his body, say, on a wristwatch. THEN came Sept. 11, and the resulting urgent national drive to increase America's homeland security. And in this new climate of fear, in which many Americans are susceptible to valuing safety over freedom, security over privacy, the company has found its golden opportunity to re-introduce the SUBDERMAL microchip implant it had previously deemed TOO HOT<strong> </strong>FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO HANDLE." (WND)<strong>Â </strong>
February 15, 2002: "Politician Wants to 'Get Chipped' - A Brazilian legislator wants to become the first politician to be implanted with a controversial microchip that would contain his personal information. 'I want to demonstrate to the citizens of Brazil and the world that this technology is safe,' Antonio de Cunha Lima..." (WND)Â 
February 15, 2002: "The world's FIRST CYBORG,<strong> </strong>a MACHINE-ENHANCED MAN, could be walking within weeks. A British professor of cybernetics, Kevin Warwick, plans to have a CHIP IMPLANTED IN HIS ARM that will transmit signals from his nervous system to a computer....The Reading University professor first HAD A CHIP IMPLANTED in 1998 that communicated with a network of antennas in his laboratory, so, for example, the door opened as he approached....Systems that rely on the power of thought to move artificial limbs have already been developed. Their potential was recently demonstrated by a monkey in Brooklyn, New York, whose brain signals were used to control a robotic arm located in North Carolina...." (Theage.com)Â 
February 16, 2002: "Chip implant signals A NEW KIND OF MAN - The world's first cyborg, a machine-enhanced man, could be walking within weeks...."(TheAge.com)Â 
March 7, 2002:"CHIPS to keep family HEALTHY - The family that GETS CHIPPED TOGETHER, STAYS TOGETHER - A US family has come up with a novel way of tightening family ties, by getting computer chip implants..."Â 
March 11, 2002: "Meet THE CHIPSONS - Jeffrey, Leslie and their boy Derek will be America's first cyborg family. Are YOU READY to 'Get CHIPPED'?" (Time.com)Â 
March 11, 2002: "New BODY ART: Chip IMPLANTS - A Canadian artist has implanted microchips in her hands in a quest to explore the relationship between identity and technology in an era when life is increasingly regulated by gadgets and machines....'I am expecting the merger between human and machines to proceed whether we want it to or not,' said Nisbet....Nisbet, 34, purchased the chips from a veterinary clinic - they are commonly used to identify livestock and pets. And after several rejections, she finally found a doctor willing to implant them in her body. (Microchips haven't been approved for human use in either the United States or Canada.)....They were INJECTED into THE BACK OF HER HANDS, in the fleshy area between the thumb and index finger...She plans to modify her computer mouse to incorporate a scanner to pick up the chips' signals and monitor her Internet use....She had the chips placed in her hands for a symbolic reason: People use their hands to interact with technology and to identify themselves (think fingerprints or palm prints). The location NISBET chose for one of the chips - the back of the right hand - is also the precise spot where, according to Biblical lore, the mark of the beast will be placed during the apocalyptic end of the world detailed in the Book of Revelation. Indeed, some Christians already believe that the Mark of the Beast is a microchip. When Applied Digital Solutions announced the creation of an implantable microchip for medical and security purposes, fervent believers decried the product as the sign of Satan....Nisbet isn't the first ARTIST to be chipped in an effort to break down the boundaries between biological and digital realms. In 1997, Eduardo Kac inserted a chip into his ankle during a live performance in Sao Paulo, then registered himself in an online pet database as both owner and animal. After he implanted the device, a collaborator in Chicago read the chip information with a robotic arm controlled over the Internet, in effect making Kac's body a node in the Internet network." (Wired News)Â 
Comments: We can now see here what may soon tie together the visual, "religious" aspect of the mark with the implantation. Nisbet, like so many in the world today (raised in secular-humanist-public-education-church) is oblivious to how she herself is CONFIRMING the literal interpretation of Scripture prophecies. In a private correspondence, she writes:Â 
"Dear Mr. Faust, While I would agree that there are many civil liberties at risk with the widespread use of implantable microchips (referring to your article "DIGITAL ANGEL: STAGE-SETTING FOR REVELATION 13"), I do not associate these risks with biblical prophesy. Sincerely, Nancy Nisbet."Â 
March 24, 2002: "CHIPS to FIGHT KIDNAPPING <strong>-</strong> Blurring the distinction between man and machine - An US company is considering producing electronic implants that could be used to keep tabs on kidnap victims via satellite....After 11 September, many western governments have become paranoid about security and want to keep a closer eye on citizens with schemes such as national ID cards...."(BBC)Â 

April 4, 2002: "Company to SELL Implantable Chip - A company plans to begin selling a computer ID chip that can be embedded beneath people's skin, now that the Food and Drug Administration has said IT WILL NOT REGULATE<strong> </strong>THE IMPLANT as long as it contains no medical data....VeriChip is expected to sell for about $200. A scanner used to read information contained in the chip would cost between $1,000 and $3,000. A doctor would insert the chip with A LARGE NEEDLE-LIKE DEVICE...." (AP/WND)Â

May 1, 2002: "Driver's LICENSE WITH CHIPS - Legislation to standardize state-issued driver's licenses across the United States, and to mandate that those licenses carry a computer CHIP<strong> </strong>and incorporate some kind of unique identifier such as a fingerprint, will be introduced in Congress on Wednesday." (UPI)Â 
May 9, 2002: "First Humans to Receive ID Chips Technology: Device implanted under skin will provide identification and medical information - Eight people will be INJECTED with silicon chips Friday, making them scannable just like a jar of peanut butter in the supermarket checkout line...While protests against the VeriChip have been minimal, neither the doctor nor Applied Digital are eager to see demonstrations. A few religious groups say the chips are 'the mark of the Beast' referred to in the Bible..." (Times)

May, 2002: "FAMILY GETS COMPUTER CHIPS IMPLANT<strong> </strong>- Boca Raton, Fla. - A Florida family on Friday became THE FIRST TO BE IMPLANTED<strong> </strong>with computer chips...They are similar to chips implanted in pets to identify them if they are lost.

(Daily News)Â 

Comments: If poor, sweet DROOPY was found, and this shows HOW IMPORTANT micro-chipping really is, how will the media PLAY IT UP when the first precious, lost CHILD is found through CHIPPING? There will be no stopping it.Â 

December 22, 2002: "Data recorders in airplanes, the so-called black boxes, describe what went wrong after a disaster. Now, medical devices are emerging to act like A BLACK BOX IN THE HUMAN BODY, except they're being used to prevent disaster.

December 30, 2002:"...A Kenosha man was charged Monday for allegedly stalking his former girlfriend with help from a TRACKING DEVICE attached under the hood of her car." (themilwaukeechannel.com)Â 

Comments: As always, government employees, the military, the so-called "mentally ill," and ex-felons will be the first to be "chipped" against their will. Ex-felons can already be stripped of the right to vote. If the Lord tarries, this technology will allow people to play "air" instruments that will actually "play." It will allow people to "air" type, and actually type a letter. And we can be sure that unless the Lord quickly intervenes, man's unclean imagination will surely invent depraved uses for this technology:Â 

Genesis 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.Â 
*****************************************Â 

SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUMBER 666Â 

***********************************Â 

Revelation 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.Â 

There are some popular historic interpretations that may or may not have some merit:Â 

1. It stands for commerce:<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">Â </span>1 Kings 10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of GOLD,Â 

Newell in 1935 noticed that 666 was being used to advertise commercial products. Devotionally, this interpretation is certainly true. However, it is not limited to this truth.Â 

2. The number of man. Man was created on sixth day (Gen.1:27, 31).<strong> </strong>Therefore, the number would mean "Man with a lot of money and power, glorying in himself as a god." This is obviously part of the truth concerning the number.Â 

3. "Nero Caesar" adds up to 666 in Hebrew. Many have believed that Nero will be raised from the dead as Antichrist. (Maybe he will be cloned!) The Beast certainly does ascend from Hell.Â 

4. "Lateinos," and "Vicarius Filii Dei," etc. add up to 666 in Greek.Â 

5. Does "VISA" equal 666? "VI" is ROMAN for 6; "S" is Greek for 6; "A" is Babylonian for 6. This therefore represents three world kingdoms (three colors in logo?). Those who have embraced this view believe that "Visa" will ultimately get the "contract" for the mark (someone has to get it!).Â 
6. Since "S" is 6 in Greek, "SSS" would represent the occult number, "666." Notice that:Â 

"Six" begins with "S." "S" looks like a serpent. "S" is the sound of the serpent's hissing sound. "Satan" and "Serpent" (see Rev. 20) begin with "S":Â 

"This serpent Satan, is not the enemy of man, but he who made gods of our race..." (Crowley, "Magick")Â 

"S," the Greek for "6," is called the "stigma," which means "mark" or "brand." Now notice that "Harry Potter" has a "stigma" in his forehead (six or broken "S"). Sister Riplinger writes:Â 

"Stigma (prick) and charagma (sharpen to a point), both translated 'mark' in the KJV, point to the new hypodermically inserted identification microchip, inserted 'in' the hand or forehead (not 'on' as new versions say!)."Â 

Bullinger writes:Â 

"But the great significance of this number is seen when we remember that the secret symbol of the great ancient Pagan mysteries was SSS or 666; and that today it is the secret connecting link between them and their revival in Spiritism and Theosophy which aim at the union of all religions in one...<em>S </em>[was] a mark invented by the Greeks to represent 6. They called it...stigma....Stigma is a sign usually made on the body by branding or puncturing...""(E. W. Bullinger, 1837-1913, "The Apocalypse")Â 

The advertising logo for Digital Angel looks like an SSS (666). It is very strange that they would choose such a logo. Was this design created to mock fundamentalists? We are not amused. But the prophecies will be literally fulfilled.Â 

In regard to "Pokemon," a preacher writes:Â 

"He has a pentagram on his forehead, SSS ON HIS CHEST and he is giving the Satanic salute with his left hand." (David Brown on Pokemon)Â 

In occult signs, the Satanic "S" (broken S) represents a THUNDER BOLT<strong> </strong>that means "Destroyer." It was worn by the SS of Nazi Germany. Among other things, it means "man is god."Â 
All of these views are interesting. We must continue to "watch."Â 
*****************Â 

CONCLUSIONÂ 

****************Â 

Well, the stage is rapidly being set for the last and final act of rebellion before the Lord Jesus comes to claim this earth as its rightful King. Do you know for sure where you will spend eternity? If you say, "I HOPE I will be with God in happiness," this only shows that you are probably trusting in your own good works. God sent His Son to become a man, live without sin, and shed His precious Blood on a cross to purchase salvation for all mankind. One sin against the Omnipotent, eternal, Holy Creator merits eternal torment in the Lake of Fire. Do you believe that you deserve this punishment? But God who is rich in mercy so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16). Will you believe this truth and receive the free gift of eternal life? Do so this very moment! Do you NOW know for sure whether or not you will spend eternity with God in happiness? If you say, "YES I DO!" I must ask you why God should save you. If you smile and say, "Because I have believed the good news according to the Scriptures, that Jesus Christ has died for me, a poor, miserable sinner, and He has promised me eternal life as a free gift through His Blood!," then I say AMEN to you! Glory be to God!Â 

If you are a Christian, in light of these developments in 2002, what may we expect in 2003! If there was ever a time to forsake not the "assembling of ourselves" together (Heb.10) it is now! Do something for Jesus! Hate the garment even spotted with the flesh! Christian, if you are going to do something for Jesus, you had better do it now. Let us make up for lost time spent slumbering in the Hollywood cesspool:Â 

Luke 14:21 ....GO OUT QUICKLY into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

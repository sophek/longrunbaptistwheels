        <h1>RILEY PROVES THAT KJV ONLYISM IS NOT OF RECENT ORIGIN</h1>

In my book, "The Common Man's Defense of KJV Onlyism", I document the fact that many scholars in the early 19th century believed the A.V. to be a work of God's Providence. They resisted any efforts to improve upon it, and warned future generations of devastating consequences. There is an interesting quote in William B. Riley's, "The Menace of Modernism" (New York: Christian Alliance Publications, 1917) that reveals that many Christians went beyond this belief. They held to the ABSOLUTE INERRANCY of the KJV. It is often claimed that this doctrine originated with Peter Ruckman. He certainly has been an influential and vocal supporter of this view, preserving it and clarifying it in modern times. Yet, according to W.B. Riley (1861-1947), there have been many others who held this view throughout the centuries.

Riley's book against modernism might be a bit confusing to some. It is perhaps for this reason that some have listed him as a KJV Onlyist. He was not. Many of the early fundamental Baptists (like Riley) accepted the R.V. They were not aware of the beliefs and practices of men such as Wescott and Hort. There were some early fundamentalists that clearly exposed the errors in the R.V. Men like Philip Mauro certainly contended against it. However, many others were blind to the issues involved.

Riley's book divides between THREE conceptions. He sees the OLD conception, the NEW conception, and then what he calls the TRUE conception. By contrasting the OLD conception with the NEW, Riley is not approving of the old. He sees the old conception as extreme. He defines the new conception as the "menace of modernism". He then strives for a balance between the two extremes. It is interesting that Riley defines four main views as the "old
conception":

1. The belief that the Bible was put together in Heaven and handed down
2. The belief that the sun revolves around the earth, instead of the other way around
3. The belief that the creation in Genesis was finished in 6 literal 24 hour days
4. The belief in the absolute innerancy of the KJV

Of course, we all take #1 as ridiculous. Riley states that he has never heard that view before and that it was a modernist who made the absurd claim that some have actually believed it. Therefore, Riley really limits the "OLD CONCEPTION" to three views.

The only way to absolutely prove that #2 is false or "extreme" (other than by revelation) is to go outside the universe and look in. That is why the view is still being debated around the world by many scientific-minded Christians. The issue (from a scientific examination) is "over my head" (in more ways than one). In Scripture, the issue hinges on whether or not we take certain words and phrases as relative (to man's sensory experience) or absolute (Ps.19:4-4, 93:1, etc.).

But what about #3? I must confess that out of Riley's three conceptions, this fundamentalist will stay with the OLD! I believe in a literal six day creation. I also believe in an absolutely inerrant KJV. And I am certainly pleased to know that the same men who contended for a literal 6 day creation also contended for the perfection of the KJV. We will let Riley testify to this fact:

"In order, therefore, to get a proper setting, both for our theme and the proper interpretation of the text quoted, permit me, first of all, to present THE OLD CONCEPTION....Is the King James version absolutely inerrant? On this point we are inclined to think that even unto comparatively recent years, such a theory has been entertained...Is a literal acceptance and interpretation alone correct? This doctrine has always had its adherents, and perhaps always will. Yet it belongs to the old conception. Out of this view has grown the very claim with which modern science has been compelled to take issue. It was this view that made men say that God created the earth in six 'literal' days of twenty-four hours each...It was this conception that led even so remarkable a man as John Calvin to oppose Copernicus by an appeal to the ninety third Psalm..."

Riley reveals that "even unto comparatively recent years" that the KJV Only view has been embraced. He finishes his rebuke of old fundamentalism by warning against extreme modernism. He then finishes with his own view, which he calls the "true conception". He writes:

"The true conception also is to the effect that the accepted versions of the Bible are all substantially correct."

I maintain that such a conclusion is the "noodle soup" out of which modernism "evolved". It is the very food by which liberalism thrives. We need to close the gap! While I am encouraged by Riley's fundamentalism and conviction in many areas (he joined the Baptist Bible Union founded by R.E. Neighbour to protest liberalism, etc.), we must not repeat his errors. Nevertheless, he has documented that a belief in the absolute perfection in the King James Version was as popular among COMMON CHRISTIANS as the belief in a literal, six day creation. Therefore, from here on out, this belief should be referred to as, "The old time Fundamentalism of the common man" when it is decried by anti-KJVOnlyists. I am not ashamed to hold to this view. I think many a grandmother could teach quite a few scholars quite a bit about "old time religion". In fact,
according to the Gospel, the common man is often way ahead of the "scholars":

Mark 12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the COMMON PEOPLE heard him gladly.

John 7:47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

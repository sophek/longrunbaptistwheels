YE SHALL BE AS GODS: THE BLASPHEMOUS FALLING AWAY

"There is the blasphemy of pride; when man, the sinner, dares to take to
himself the titles and worship due to God alone." (Robert Govett,
"Exposition on the Gospel of John")

In ages past, Lucifer was a prince upon this earth in the city of Eden:

Ezekiel 28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious
stone was thy covering...
15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till
iniquity was found in thee.

Lucifer, through sinfully taking pride in his beauty and brightness, soon
rebelled against God and left his place in a mad lust for equality with
God:

Ezekiel 28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness...

1 Timothy 3:6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with PRIDE he fall into
the condemnation of the DEVIL.

Isaiah 14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O LUCIFER, son of the
morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the
nations!
13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God....
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be LIKE THE MOST
HIGH.
15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

Lucifer's rebellious plan was immediately thwarted. Yet, his lust remains.
The prophecy relates to the future, as well as to the past. The future
Antichrist will be possessed with the same Satanic lust and delusion:

2 Thessalonians 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day
shall not come, except there come a FALLING AWAY first, and that man of
sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself ABOVE ALL THAT IS CALLED GOD, or that
is worshipped; so that he AS GOD sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
himself that HE IS GOD.

In these last days, in preparation for the Tribulation period and the
Antichrist, we are beholding the "falling away." The ancient presumption
of Lucifer is being proclaimed in almost every area of society; it is
taught as doctrine throughout Christendom:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.
2 For men shall be LOVERS OF THEIR OWN SELVES, covetous, boasters, PROUD,
BLASPHEMERS...

There is, of course, an attempt to "sanctify" this devilish pride and
blasphemy through sophistry, smooth words, and misapplied Scripture. Yet,
the Devil's devices are not difficult to detect. They are clearly
manifested by the Spirit of God in the third chapter of the first Book of
the Holy Bible:

Genesis 3:1 Now the SERPENT was more subtil than any beast of the field
which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God
said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
be opened, and YE SHALL BE AS GODS, knowing good and evil.

The final lie (i,e. bait) of the "old serpent" (Revelation 20:2) is that
men may become "as gods." However, the Devil does not BEGIN with this lie.
He must FIRST set about to destroy the AUTHORITY of God's Word. His first
words to Eve were, "Yea, hath God said...?" In other words, the doctrines
of the inspiration, the perfect preservation, and the sufficiency of
Scripture must be attacked and maligned.

After a few generations of assault on Scripture, the Devil launches his
next attack: "Ye shall not surely die." Once the Scripture is no longer
fully trusted, Satan can tempt man to trust in his own understanding or
emotions. The teaching of eternal torment is then attacked. For believers,
the doctrine of the Judgment Seat of Christ and the warnings to believers
are explained away or ignored. Before long, a majority of unbelievers and
believers no longer believe in the inspired, preserved Scriptures
(sufficient for every spiritual need), and they no longer FEAR God!
Libertinism invades the churches. A mystical, subjective "love" replaces
loving obedience to God. Fearing God is seen as bondage and legalism
instead of a foundation for true wisdom and power.

With these two attacks of the Devil, mankind is then ready to listen to
the Devil slander God's goodness: "For God doth know..." In other words,
God's commandment is grievous (1 John 5:3). The Devil implies that God is
holding some good back from His people.

At this point, the victims of the Devil are prepared to hear his ultimate
lie: "...in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and YE
SHALL BE AS GODS..." This lie of deification or divinization is the MAIN
(though not only) doctrine of the present falling away. It will, no doubt,
continue to grow in popularity.

Notice a summary, step by step, of the Devil's war strategy:

1. Attack the revelation and authority of God
2. Attack the severity of God
3. Attack the goodness of God
4. Attack the uniqueness of God

Before the Devil can launch his ultimate attack upon the doctrine of the
uniqueness of God (successfully seduce men into believing they may become
gods), he must go through the previous three steps. He does this
individually, as well as with mankind as a whole, throughout history.

The uniqueness of God is taught in many Scriptures:

Isaiah 44:8 ....Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I KNOW NOT
ANY.

Isaiah 43:10 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he:
before me there was no God formed, NEITHER SHALL THERE BE AFTER ME.

1 Corinthians 8:5 For though there be that are CALLED gods, whether in
heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
6 But to us there is but ONE GOD, the Father, of whom are all things, and
we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
him.

It is therefore blasphemous for any man to dare to steal the prerogatives
that belong only to the true God. This is why the apostles rent their
clothes when they were called "gods" by the Gentiles:

Acts 14:11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to
us in the likeness of men.
14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their
clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out...
15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like
passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these
vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
and all things that are therein:

If we are to believe many of the "theologians" today, we would have to
confess that Paul did not "know who he was in Christ." We would have to
believe that Paul was psychologically unsound. Likewise, the holy angels
must be psychologically unsound. They likewise protect God's special,
unique glory:

Revelation 22:8 ...And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to WORSHIP
before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.
9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy FELLOWSERVANT,
and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of
this book: WORSHIP GOD.

In contrast to the apostles and the angels, the following men and women
are guilty of presumptuous, arrogant blasphemy. This list is not complete.
The same lie can be found in eastern mysticism, occultism, theosophy, etc.
The philosophical, theological and semantic gymnastics which are used in
an attempt to "sanctify" the Satanism in the following quotes, only make
the pot stink all the more! The hog of heresy is ugly enough without a
gold jewel in her snout (Proverbs 11:22):

HUMANISTIC BLASPHEMY:

"Humanism is faith in the SUPREME VALUE and self-perfectibility of human
personality....By supreme value is meant that there is nothing else in the
universe so important and that all things are of value only as they
contribute to it....Was Jesus a Humanist?....The kinship of man to God,
suggested in the word sons, implies that what has been termed DIVINITY is,
after all, accessible to the sons of God.... "
("Humanism: A New Religion," 1930, p.14, 85, 91)

NEW AGE BLASPHEMY:

"We are all in essence perfect, spiritual beings. We are each a perfect
expression of the universal mind or GOD consciousness that is within us."
(Shakti Gawain, "Creative Visualization," 1978, p.78)

"I know that I exist, therefore I AM. I know that the God source exists.
Therefore IT IS. Since I am a part of that force, then I AM that I AM."
(Shirley MacLaine, "Dancing in the Light")

PSYCHOLOGICAL BLASPHEMY:

"God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself). We are growing
toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution....again I know of no
hypothesis as satisfactory as the postulation of a God who is intimately
associated with us - so intimately that He is part of us. If you want to
know the closest place to look for grace, it is within yourself. If you
desire wisdom greater than your own, you can find it inside you....To put
it plainly, our unconscious is God. God within us. We were part of God all
the time."
(M. Scott Peck, "The Road Less Traveled," 1978, p.269, 281)

"Adam and Eve, at the beginning of their evolution, are bound to blood and
soil; they are still 'blind.' But 'their eyes are opened' after they
acquire the knowledge of good and evil....This is not the story of the
'fall' of man, but of his awakening - and thus, of the beginning of his
rise."
(Erich Fromm, "You Shall Be As Gods," 1966)

MORMON BLASPHEMY:

"Here, then, is eternal life to know the only wise and true God; and you
have got to learn how to be gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests
to God, the same as all gods have done before you...."
(Joseph Smith, "History of the Church," Vol. 6, pp. 305-06).

"As God once was, man is. As God is, man may become."
(Lorenzo Snow, Mormon leader)

"Brethren 225,000 of you are here tonight. I suppose 225,000 of you may
become gods. There seems to be plenty of space out there in the universe.
And the Lord has proved that he knows how to do it. I think he could make,
or probably have us help make, worlds for all of us, for every one of us
225,000..."
(Twelfth President, Spencer W. Kimball, "The Ensign," 1975)

"'Then shall they be gods, because they have no end...verily, verily, I
say unto, except ye abide in my law ye cannot attain to this glory.' (D.&amp;
C. 132:4-6, 15-17, 19-21.) From this revelation, it will be seen that men
can become Gods and enjoy a 'fulness and a continuation of the seeds
forever and ever,' only by observing the new and everlasting covenant of
marriage, and that without marriage they can only become 'ministering
servants...'"
(Elder LeGrand Richards, Of the Council of the Twelve, "A Marvelous Work
and Wonder," Deseret Book Company, 1973 edition)

ROMAN CATHOLIC BLASPHEMY:

By the 4th century, the false doctrine of man's deification was in bloom:

"For the Son of God became man so that we might become God."
(St. Athanasius, "De Decretis," about 325)

"...let us become the image of the one whole God, bearing nothing earthly
in ourselves, so that we may consort with God and become gods, receiving
from God our existence as gods..." (Maximos the Confessor, 7th century,
"Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice.")

"The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his DIVINITY,
assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men GODS."
(St. Thomas Aquinas, "Opusculum contra errores graecorum," 1261-64)

This old heresy in some of the later "church fathers" would be used
centuries later by the Roman Catholic Church to justify its own doctrine
of the deification of man in the Satanic "Age of Aquarius." In the
"Catechism of the Catholic Church" (New York, NY: Image Books, 1995), the
deification of man is taught with an appeal to Roman Catholic tradition:

"#460: ...'For the Son of God became man so that we might become God.'
'The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity,
assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.' [Catechism
quoting Athanasius and Thomas Aquinas]."

"#795: Christ and his Church thus together make up the 'whole Christ'
(Christus totus). The Church is one with Christ. The saints are acutely
aware of this unity: Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have
become not only Christians, but CHRIST HIMSELF. Do you understand and
grasp, brethren, God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we have become
Christ.....[Catechism quoting Augustine, Bishop of Hippo 354-430]..."

It Satanic blasphemy is also seen in the prayer of the Catholic priest in
the Liturgy of the Eucharist, when the water is mixed with the wine:

"By the mystery of this water and wine, may we come to share in the
divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity."

Pope John Paul II also explains that by working hard (by "grace"), man
will not only be "saved," he will be DEIFIED!:

"...a good life is the condition of salvation; and that salvation cannot
be attained without the help of grace....The truth according to which man
is called to cooperate with God in all things, with a view toward the
ultimate purpose of his life - his salvation AND DIVINIZATION...."
(John Paul II, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," Knopf, 1994, p.194-195)

EASTERN ORTHODOX BLASPHEMY:

"Deification...is the ultimate purpose of God's creation....keeping the
commandments of God is indispensable: 'In the end they make a man
god....'"
(Daniel B. Clendenin, "Eastern Orthodox Christianity," 1994)

"Frank Schaeffer (son of Francis and Edith Schaeffer) dedicates the story
of his conversion to Orthodoxy to several former Campus Crusade staff
members who are now Orthodox priests....He says we are not saved by
'believing that Christ died on the cross for us [but] by struggling to
become like Christ....We are gradually saved as we are DEIFIED."
(Schaeffer, "Dancing," quoted in Dave Hunt, "Occult Invasion," 1998)

APOSTATE CHRISTIAN BLASPHEMY:

"We affirm our DIVINITY by doing what is worthy of gods, and we affirm our
humanity by taking risks only available to mortals. God had to become one
of us before He could become heroic ... Robert Schuller affirms our
divinity, yet does not deny our humanity...isn't that what the gospel is?
Isn't God's message to sinful humanity that He sees in each of us a DIVINE
nature of such worth that He sacrificed His own Son so that our divine
potentialities might be realized?.....Erich Fromm, one of the most popular
psychoanalysts of our time, recognized the diabolical social consequences
that can come about when a person loses sight of his/her own DIVINITY...."
(Tony Campolo, "Partly Right")

"What do I mean by sin? Answer: Any human condition or act that robs God
of glory by stripping one of his children of their right to DIVINE
dignity....The Cross sanctifies the ego trip....To be born again means
that we must be changed from a negative to a positive self-image - from
inferiority to self-esteem....the Ideal One [Jesus] receives me as his
peer and treats me AS AN EQUAL....And we can PRAY, 'Our Father in heaven,
honorable is OUR NAME....if Christianity is to succeed in the next
millennium, it must cease to be a negative religion and must become
positive."
(Robert Schuller, "Self-Esteem: The New Reformation," 1982, p.14, 68-69,
75)

"You are as much the incarnation of God as Christ was....The believer is
as much an incarnation as was Jesus of Nazareth."
(Kenneth Hagin, "Word of Faith," December 1980)

"[Man] was created on terms of equality with God, and he could stand in
God's presence without any consciousness of inferiority...[The] believer
is called Christ....That's who we are; we're Christ."
(Kenneth Hagin, "Zoe: The God-Kind of Life," 1989)

"Adam and Eve were placed in the world as the seed and expression of God.
Just as dogs have puppies and cats have kittens, so God has little gods;
we have trouble comprehending this truth. Until we comprehend that we are
little gods, we cannot manifest the kingdom of God."
(Earl Paulk, "Satan Unmasked")

"And Adam is as much like God as you can get, just the same as Jesus when
He came into the earth."
(Kenneth Copeland, "Following the Faith of Abraham", sermon tape)

"You don't have a god in you, you are one."
(Kenneth Copeland, "The Force of Love," sermon tape)

"When I read in the Bible where He says, 'I AM,' I say, 'Yes, I am too'!"
(Kenneth Copeland, July 1987 crusade)

â€œJesus is no longer the only begotten Son of God.â€
(Kenneth Copeland, "Now We Are In Christ Jesus," 1980)

"You are not a spiritual schizophrenic - half-God and half-Satan - you are
all-God."
(Kenneth Copeland, "Now We Are in Christ Jesus," 1980)

I am a little god!...I have His name. I'm one with Him. I'm in covenant
relation. I am a little god! Critics, be gone!"
(Paul Crouch, TBN July 7, 1986)

"God draws no distinction between Himself and us. God opens up the union
of the very Godhead, and brings us into it."
(Paul Crouch, TBN, November, 1990)

"When God made Adam all He did was make an exact imprint of Himself. He
duplicated Himself..."
(Creflo Dollar, "Our equality with God Through Righteousness," January 21,
2001)

"Let's say, 'I am a God man.'...This spirit man within me is a God-Man."
(Benny Hinn, TBN, December 6, 1990)

"Jesus said, 'And I love you enough to make you one of me!"
(Benny Hinn, TBN, December 1, 1990 )

"God came to earth and touched a piece of dust and turned it into a God."
(Benny Hinn, TBN, Dec 1, 1990)

Objections Answered

When the Bible calls Satan the "god" of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4), it
does not mean that Satan is EQUAL with the only true God. In the same
manner, the supposed use of the word "god" as a title of some limited
authority (as in "lord"), NEVER implies (except in the case of Jesus
Christ) that a man or angel is of the same substance or essence with God!
It never implies that a man or angel is equal with God! Therefore, to
speak of "deification" and "divinization" is blasphemous.

When men and angels walk contrary to God's will, they have rebelliously
declared themselves to be "gods." They have rebelliously stolen the right
to "know" (decide apart from God) "good and evil." But when a man (as Adam
and Eve) makes up his own morality, he has NOT become God is essence or
substance. He is NOT equal with God in His Divine attributes. He is simply
"like" God in the sense that he is INDEPENDENTLY declaring what is good or
evil for himself (John 10:34, Genesis 3:5). But God cannot forever allow
His creatures to walk "as gods" and make up their own morality! Once they
begin to rebel in such a fashion, they must be destroyed, banished, or
temporarily restrained (Genesis 3:22, 11:6-7). The Bible teaches that
every "god" that did NOT make heaven and earth shall perish (Jeremiah
10:10-11). Therefore, the Devil played a Satanic trick on man. There is
only ONE God, and He will not share His unique Divinity with His
creatures. It is impossible and blasphemous. For men to act as "gods"
(create their own morality), or to blasphemously assume the titles,
equality, or worship of God, is to bring down the wrath of God upon their
heads!

Finally, often the wording of 2 Peter 1:4 is used to justify blasphemy:
"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by
these ye might be PARTAKERS OF the DIVINE nature..." First of all, the
phrase "partakers of" does not mean that a person becomes that which he
partakes of! Those who will be "partakers of Christ" (Hebrews 3:14) will
not BECOME Christ! We that are "partakers of" the Holy Ghost (Hebrews 6:4)
have not become the Holy Ghost! The farmer that must first "partake of"
his fruits (2 Timothy 2:6) does not BECOME wheat and barley! The phrase
obviously means that obedient Christians receive qualities and attributes
(nature) in their lives that are given by God (divine) and approved by Him
(godliness). Or, it means that "the divine nature" (God), by His grace,
freely gives to believers the power to live holy. This is taught in the
previous verse:

2 Peter 1:3 According as his DIVINE POWER hath GIVEN unto us all things
that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that
hath called us to glory and virtue:

But it certainly does not teach the blasphemy that Christians are part of
the Godhead, have become a member of the Trinity, and are equal in
substance and essence with God Himself. It provides no ground for a
Satanic "pep rally" wherein thousands of people chant that they are
"little gods" and have become "Christ"! It is blasphemous to use the
Scriptures that speak of our union and fellowship with Jesus as a grounds
for Luciferic presumption! Let us contend against this insanity.

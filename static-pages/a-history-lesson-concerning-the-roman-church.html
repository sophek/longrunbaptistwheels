        <h1>A HISTORY LESSON CONCERNING THE ROMAN CHURCH</h1>
        <div id="content">
            I recently read where a leader of the Orthodox church called the Catholic Pope "his Holiness." Now this is certainly something I can comment upon having studied the Bible and a bit of church history. Times have certainly changed; at least according to appearance. What kind of statement is that to make about a pope? It is certainly blasphemous! But many now think the present pope is indeed "holy" and deserving of such a title since he has supposedly apologized for some of the terrible "mistakes" throughout history of some of the "children" of the Catholic Church. What many do not understand is that this is simply an ecumenical device designed to bring as many as possible back into the fold of Rome's heresies as prophesied by the Bible. (Rev.17) If the pope is indeed truly sorry, then let him renounce his blasphemous office, the blasphemous titles and the blasphemous claims the Catholic church makes for itself. Has the pope ever confessed that the Catholic church did not have the RIGHT before God (or ever will) to kill in the name of religion? Has he confessed that it did not have the RIGHT to force people to conform to its traditions? Has he confessed that it did not have AUTHORITY from God (or ever will) over the kingdoms and nations of this world? Is he "sorry" that Protestants disobeyed "church authority" and had to die, or is he sorry that millions were brutally murdered under a church that pretended to authority it did not have before God!? The answer really does matter now doesn't it? All of this is not to mention the fact that the Vatican has never admitted the numbers of those it butchered throughout history. Just in this century, during World War II, Croatia set a goal to be 100% Roman Catholic. The Serbian Orthodox Church reports that a million and a half were slaughtered for not conforming! Now, what is a "conservative" portion of that number?: "During the existence of Croatia as an independent Catholic State, over 700,000 men, women and children perished. Many were executed, tortured, died of starvation, buried alive, or were burned to death." (Preface of Avro Manhattan's "The Vatican's Holocaust") "Monk Ambrozije Novak, Guardian of the Capucine Monastery in Varazdin, who, after surrounding the village of Mosanica with Ustashi contingents, told the people: 'You Serbs are condemned to death, and you can only escape that sentence by accepting Catholicism.'...The Nazis, who for a time were posted in Croatia, were so horrified at the Ustashi atrocities that they set up special commission to investigate them. The Orthodox Church of Serbia, in fact, appealed directly to the Nazi General Dukelman to intervene and stop the Ustashi horrors." (Avro Manhattan's "The Vatican's Holocaust")

This of course is only RECENT history. If the pope will even begin to be "holy," let him renounce his blasphemous titles, confess himself a sinner and tell the TRUTH about history:
<blockquote>"But we might as well deny that such a city as Rome ever existed, as deny that the Romish church has been a persecuting establishment in practice...It is well attested by history, that she massacred in several successive persecutions more than a million of Albigenses and Waldenses, amid circumstances of the most revolting cruelty. Her bigoted minions butchered about 1,500,000 Jews in Spain, because they would not adopt the Romish superstitions. When the Moors conquered Spain in the 8th century, they allowed the Romanists to retain their own religion; but when the papist 700 years after gained the mastery over the descendants of the Moors, they butchered between 2 and 3,000,000 of them. At the massacre of St. Bartholomew's eve, August 22d, 1572, they murdered in France, from fifty to a hundred thousand of unoffending Protestants. 'A Horrible scene' was witnessed (in Paris) when the very streets and passages resounded with the noise of those met together for murder and plunder; the groans of those who were dying, and the shrieks of such as were just going to be butchered, were every where to be heard. The bodies of the slain were thrown out of the windows, and passages and chambers of the houses were filled with them...From the city of Paris the massacre spread throughout the whole kingdom. In the city of Meaux, they threw above two hundred into jail; and after they had ravished and killed a great number of women, and plundered the houses of the Protestants, they executed their fury on those they had imprisoned; and calling them one by one, they were killed....like sheep in a market...The same cruelties were practiced at Orleans, Angiers, Troyes, Bourges, La Charite, and especially at Lyons; where they inhumanly destroyed above 800 Protestants; children hanging on their parents' necks; parents embracing their children...throwing them mangled, torn and half-dead, into the river. For thirty days this massacre was continued; and when the news reached Rome, did the holy Father disapprove this inhuman butchery? No, but so delighted was he, that he and his cardinals repaired to church and publicly gave thanks to God for the glorious news; the cannon was discharged, and a jubilee proclaimed throughout the whole papal world!!....But, all this while, the work of human butchery was also carried on in secret, with still greater horrors, by the infernal inquisition...it is estimated by the Spanish ecclesiastic, Llorente, who had himself been secretary to the inquisition, that in Spain alone, till the year 1808, there had been burnt alive 34,658 persons, and condemned to the gallies 288,219. How many died during the infliction of torture, is known only to God! In all, it is thought, the Inquisition has cost Spain 2,000,000 lives!! Adding to this the butcheries in other countries, who have been massacred by the Romanists for the sake of their religion, amounts to the awful number of 68,000,000." ("Papal Hierarchy," S.S. Schmucker, 1845)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Harlot seated on Seven Hills is, at the end, drunken with the 'blood of the martyrs of Jesus.' (Rev.17:6) It has been estimated that the Church of Rome has been guilty of the death of more than 50,000,000 believers." (Panton, "The Dawn," Jan, 1949)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It is enough to make the blood run cold, to read of the horrid murders and devastations of this time, how many of these poor innocent Christians were sacrificed to the blind fury and malice of their enemies. It is computed that in France alone were slain a million." (Thomas Newton's "Dissertations On The Prophecies," Vol.3, p.178, 1760)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Notwithstanding I am disposed to recite the words of Thuanus an excellent historian but of the other side; 'Against the Waldenses,' (saith he, in the Preface of the history of his time) 'when as exquisite punishments did little prevail, and the evil was exasperated by the remedy which was unseasonably applied, and the number of them daily increased, whole armies at length were mustered; neither was the war fought against them of less weight, then that which ours before waged against the Saracens; of which this was the issue, that they were rather beaten, put to flight, every where spoiled of their goods and dignities, and scattered here and there...'...We heretofore shewed the number of the Albigenses and Waldenses that were slain estimated to ten hundred thousand men...From the beginning of the Jesuits to the year 1580, that is, in little more than thirty years, 'Baldwinus de Antichristo' noted almost nine hundred thousand orthodox Christians to have been put to death, and that alone by the hand of the Executioner, the Duke d' Alva that cruel Champion of the See of Rome gloried that he had been the author of the slaughter of 36,000 souls in Belgium only within a few years." (Mede, "The Key Of The Revelation," 1643)</blockquote>
Let us love Catholics enough to tell them the truth so they may be saved. Rome will rise again.(Rev.17) God have mercy on those Christian leaders who are presently helping her to do so just to receive the "gift" money from Catholics and immature Christians who support their ministries! (And some people criticize me for believing in "too strict" a Judgment Seat of Christ!)

        <h1>JOEY FAUST RESPONDS TO ROBERT L. SUMNER'S REVIEW OF THE ROD: WILL GOD SPARE IT?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p>As modern Christians flee from their warnings and assign them to only "false professors," they must then strive to prove they are elect (and not only a professor) by a life of good works and "enduring to the end." Brother Sumner may think he has brought forth enough fruit to think himself a "real" Christian thus far in his life, but he must wait and see what will happen next week. To keep the warnings from applying to the Millennium (and "favoring" an archaic view of Purgatory), Sumner must logically apply the warnings to ETERNITY, and thereby teach salvation assurance through works of righteousness and enduring. The evangelicals and Catholics who joined hands and signed E.C.T. are waiting for Sumner's signature. They have also largely abandoned literal, temporal punishment in regard to accountability; but they love Sumner's "strive your whole life to prove you are elect" view of salvation assurance!</p>
<p>The fundamental and premillennial writers I quote in my book as advocates of my position were the chief opponents of Rome, and are often quoted as such in commentaries. That there is some surface similarity between literal chastisement for carnal Christians at the Judgment Seat of Christ and Rome's OLD doctrine of Purgatory, I do not deny. But there is also a similar, surface likeness between Catholic charity and the charity of true Christians! On the other hand, there is also a vast sea of difference, doctrinally. Rome adds eternal-atoning value to good works and sufferings. The true Christian only sees eternal-atoning value in the Blood of Jesus Christ on the Cross.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "He opens with a chapter about 'accountability truth' and insists that Christians are going to be accountable to God not only for good works as believers, but for bad ones as well. We couldn't agree more and it is something we have highlighted strongly throughout the 60 years of our ministry..."</p>
<p>Based on Sumner's words above, I suppose he wants us to believe that he has given the Biblical warnings to believers due weight for over 60 years. They always tell us this. In reality, he has spent decades trying to argue out of the warnings (and talk young Christians out of them) since the day God tried to reveal them to him by the ministry of fundamentalist leaders such as R. T. Ketcham, years ago. Fundamentalists are aware of the fact that they should be preaching the "fear of the Lord" and accountability at the Judgment Seat. But the majority of Christians in this modern age do not want to hear about accountability. Therefore, it is easier for preachers to use great swelling words about how they stand for the fear of God and preach a true Judgment Seat, while they actually scratch itching ears with "ye shalt not surely die" sophistry. Yet, this "flowery bed of ease" preaching of much of modern "fundamentalism" is simply the syrupy doctrines of early, 1920 liberalism - at least in regard to Christian accountability. In that day, even the liberal heretic, Harry E. Fosdick, thought their "new view of God" was encouraging self-complacency!:</p>
<p>"Indeed, the god of the new theology...has not been warranted to punish heavily; he has been an indulgent parent....the new theology...had never learned to preach on that text in the New Testament, 'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.'..." (Fosdick, "Christianity and Progress," 1922)</p>
<p>But today, one can scarcely find a professing FUNDAMENTALIST who will rise up and contend against this Laodicean complacency by calling the attention of believers to their literal warnings. In regard to the Judgment Seat, many are now worse than the liberals in 1920! According to Sumner, as we will see in part 2, EVERY Christian ends up with praise at the Judgment Seat! Incredible! To Sumner, the only danger or threat for the Christian is a subjective, undefined, "receiving of loss," which, whatever it means, according to Sumner, it CANNOT mean physical or literal pain, stripes, fire, death, or banishment! Sumner never wonders why it is that God did not choose to use ONLY this type of chastisement in THIS LIFE. If this type of subjective threat (with PRAISE included!) is sufficient for the Judgment Seat, then why did God KILL Christians and make them SICK in Corinth (1 Corinthians 11)? If this type of chastisement occurs in THIS LIFE in the age of God's LONGSUFFERING, on what basis can modern preachers dogmatically deny the slightest literal stripe on the future day of JUDGMENT? It is illogical and absurd, and numerous Scriptures must be bent and explained away to maintain such a conclusion.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "However, when he goes on to make this accountability a punishment that denies some believers entrance into the millennial kingdom and places them in a Protestant Purgatory, we couldn't disagree more!"</p>
<p>He reacts to the word "punishment," yet I show in my book the English definition of the word and what I therefore mean by it:</p>
<p>"Punishment: Any pain or suffering inflicted on a person for a crime or offense...The punishment of the faults and offenses of children BY THE PARENT, is by virtue of the right of government with which the parent is invested by God himself. The species of punishment is chastisement or correction....Divine punishments are doubtless designed to secure obedience and uphold the moral order of created intelligent beings." (Webster's 1828)</p>
<p>Sumner's reaction against the concept of God's Parental "punishment" is indicative of the worldliness that has entered into much of modern theology. In the 1940's and 50's, a majority of parents, for the first time, surrendered their children to the advice of the "professionals." For example, the 1945, "Woman's Home Companion" advised its readers:</p>
<p>"...when your child has a tantrum...it is a perfectly natural thing for him to do....Don't scold or PUNISH your child. Try to make him happy, do what he is interested in. PUNISHMENT will only harm his development."</p>
<p>The rotten fruit of this worldly advice was manifested in the turbulence of the 1960's. Sumner's aversion to the word "punishment" for Christians at the Judgment Seat is probably due to the fact that, instead of resisting the world and enlightening it, much of modern theology has been tainted by it. Secondly, many fail to see the basic division in Scripture between eternal punishment for sin (which Christ bore in His Body on the Cross) and the temporal punishment for sin of the child of God. Jesus Christ was punished for all our sins, past, present and future and He thereby removed the eternal, positional stain of guilt. However, this does not mean that God cannot still punish His children with stripes for their faults. Christians are told to confess their sins if they want them forgiven (1 John 1:9). This has to do with maintaining fellowship, not maintaining (or proving) positional relationship (as Rome teaches). I wonder if Sumner ever asks God to forgive him for sins? Has he never confessed his sins in his Christian life? If he has, why did he do so, if they are already paid for? If Sumner answers that he confesses them to maintain fellowship and avoid chastisement, then he should not have any real objection to my book. He should see that the Bible extends this same principle to the Judgment Seat and the Millennial Kingdom. R. T. Ketcham writes:</p>
<p>"[Many believe that] some believers will have no reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ, but because chastisement ends with this life, there will be none there. The difference between this common conception and the view set forth in this chapter is simply this: The principle of chastisement remains the same; the difference is in the extent to which it is carried. One halts the process at the Judgment Seat of Christ; the other allows its continuance for those who did not submit to its benefactions here. I have searched in vain for a single Scripture to prove the discontinuance of this principle at the Lordâ€™s return. On the other hand a great mass of Scriptureâ€¦seems to indicate the awful and soul-searching truth that there is such a thing as CORRECTIVE DISCIPLINE when we see Him face to face. We have been surprised to discover that MANY TEACHERS have had a conviction that this was the teaching of Scripture..."</p>
<p>In the end, it does not really matter what a person calls it. Whatever a person calls it when God makes some Christians sick in Corinth and kills others, is the same thing he can call it when God afflicts carnal saints at the Judgment Seat! One may call it chastisement, punishment, scourging, or recompense. It makes no difference to me as long as the warnings are given their due weight.</p>
<p>It is wrong for Sumner to use the word Purgatory as a PLACE in his objection. I plainly state that carnal Christians will go to where Jesus says they will go. I teach they will go into outer darkness:</p>
<p>Matthew 25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>At times Jesus calls this "Hell." It is the prison of the underworld which gives up its occupants at the Great White Throne after the Millennium (Revelation 20:13). The lost then spend eternity in the Lake of Fire. The saved, are reunited with Christ throughout eternity. I do not believe in a place called Purgatory. I do not believe any suffering of chastisement can make atonement and earn eternal salvation. I do not believe that anyone can pay or pray a person out of his chastisement on the day of judgment.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "Faust's teaching is not at all new, of course. No false teaching is. I recall being on the old Council of 14 of the General Association of Regular Baptists when we were faced with the problem of one of our highly revered and respected leaders teaching this idea, saying worldly Christians would be cast out into outer darkness as a temporary judgment for unconfessed earthly sins. He based his conclusions on a misunderstood parable, just as Faust bases many of his."</p>
<p>More than likely the leader was R. T. Ketcham who I quote in my book. It is interesting that many of the men who were at the forefront of the independent, fundamental Baptist movement around the world were kingdom exclusionists! Panton led the premillennial fundamentalists in Britain, Roadhouse in Canada, R. E. Neighbour began the B.B.U., and Ketcham was a leader in the G.A.R.B.C. Sumner called it a "problem" to be faced with the teaching. It is indeed! Light brings responsibility. What then does rejected light bring to us at the Judgment Seat? Sumner states that Ketcham (if that is who he is referring to - why not name him?) based his conclusion on a misunderstood parable. We would be inclined to believe that Sumner would "straighten it out" for us. But he doesn't. Ketcham did not base his teaching entirely on parables. This can be proven by simply reading his quotes in my book.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "In fairness to the author and his supporters - he seems to have quite a few - he vigorously denies (and his supporters join the chorus) that he is teaching a Protestant Purgatory. The denial starts on page xii of the Foreword (by ex-Catholic priest Bill Jackson, a good man whose writings we have promoted strongly over the years)."</p>
<p>Brother Bill Jackson has not been a Catholic a DAY in his life. Why would brother Sumner state such a thing without checking? It "might" give his view some much needed weight if it were true. Yet, it is not true. Imagine, here is the leader of one of the most fundamental ministries for evangelizing Catholics, writing the Foreword to my book - the book that Sumner appears to be trying to castigate as compromised with Rome in doctrine. It might be "convenient" for Sumner if it could be "implied" that perhaps Dr. Bill Jackson has not FULLY left the Catholic Church, doctrinally. However, the fact that brother Jackson has never been a Catholic a day in his life, and has spent much of his life studying the differences between Catholicism and true Christianity, certainly argues against the whole point of Sumner's rebuttal.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "In short, Faust denies the term, but teaches the act."</p>
<p>The sole similarity between a Catholic Purgatory and my teaching is punishment after death (at the Judgment Seat). The reason for the punishment, and the merit of the punishment, and the place of the punishment, are ALL vastly different, as I will document momentarily. On the other hand, there is not much difference between the E.C.T. (i.e. Evangelical and Catholics Together) view of salvation assurance and Sumner's view. We would really like him to tell us the difference. In short, he may deny the similarity, but he certainly teaches the same view.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "Faust explains the difference between his Purgatory and Rome's as being that the latter experience it [sic] 'to become a child of God and live in eternity.' In the first place he misunderstands Catholicism; its dogma teaches Catholics are already the children of God (children of Catholics are born that way, according to Rome's dogma!) and the purpose of Purgatory is refinement, making them worthy of Heaven. In short, isn't that being 'punished' for sins which Calvary apparently failed to make provision? is there much difference between the purgatories of the Vatican and Faust?"</p>
<p>There are indeed many differences. However, there is little difference between Sumner's view of Gospel assurance (which he is forced into by applying Christian warnings to false professors) and the Vatican's. The statement Sumner is referring to above is taken from the glossary in the back of my book. It reads:</p>
<p>"Disobedient Christians do not earn, contribute to, or keep their salvation in eternity by suffering chastisement during the millennium. The principle difference between Romeâ€™s Purgatory and chastisement in this life (which almost all conservative Christians advocate) is not that the former is after death and that the latter is in this life. The main theological difference lies in the purpose of the suffering. People in Romeâ€™s purgatory suffer to become a child of God and live in eternity. This denies the Gospel. On the other hand, the doctrine of millennial exclusion protects and guards the Gospel, since the various warnings to believers are not applied to eternity, which would compromise assurance through faith alone."</p>
<p>Sumner did not deal with the real difference between by view and Rome's view. He did not deal with the fact that Rome teaches that people suffer in Purgatory to earn salvation in eternity. Sumner chose to ignore a whole chapter of quotes and arguments and deal with a summary statement in the glossary which states that imperfect Catholics must suffer in Purgatory to become "children of God." I am using the term "children of God" in an evangelical sense (since Christians are my intended readers) meaning "those that are saved in eternity." I admit the glossary could have stated this view in a more technical manner to avoid confusion. Yet, the book is filled with technical quotes concerning Purgatory. Many Catholics themselves see Purgatory as a means to becoming God's child in an eternal sense:</p>
<p>"God wants us to be His family, to be His CHILDREN and share the fullness of His joy.</p>
<p>But IN ORDER to be able to be TRULY 'children of God' we MUST become pure like Him, holy like Him, loving like Him, with an unselfish, undivided heart...But, at the moment of our departure from earthly life, how many of us have become divinely pure, united in every way with God, yearning to love Him only, and devoted to Him above all?...More than anything else, we must see purgatory not as the ante-chamber of hell (suggesting a similar type of suffering), but as the entrance hall of heaven, where God is All-in-all....This joy of souls in purgatory is the result of their having trustingly handed themselves over to God and accepted the purification that arises from their love and longing as their misery truly meets His mercy. Purgatory is our meeting with Christ, who loves us, and our loving acceptance of His pardoning love. It is our passage to holiness...Their love for God keeps maturing, not only in ATONING suffering and longing, but in peace and silence as well." (St. Michael Center For the Blessed Virgin Mary, www.smcenter.org/teachings_purgatory.htm)</p>
<p>"Purgatory (Lat., "purgare", to make clean, to purify) in accordance with Catholic teaching is a place or condition of temporal punishment for those who, departing this life in God's grace, are, not entirely free from venial faults, or have not FULLY PAID the satisfaction due to their transgressions." (Catholic Encyclopedia, www.NewAdvent.org)</p>
<p>My view teaches that Jesus paid the full satisfaction for the eternal guilt of sins. However, as children of God, He has the right to chastise us for unconfessed sins in the Christian walk (even to the point of death) in temporal time, before eternity. This temporal time includes the Judgment Seat and the Millennium which is set before the believer as a prize. The difference between my view and Rome's view is found in the meaning of the phrase "not fully paid." Catholics add ETERNAL merit to everything. I do not believe that any suffering, either in this life or at the Judgment Seat has ETERNAL merit. No sufferings here or in the world to come can justify a person. Justification is God's righteousness imputed to our account through faith alone, apart from any works. It is instantaneous, complete to our account at the moment of faith, and can never be lost. However, a child of God CAN receive for the things done in his body; not as a payment (full or partial) for eternal salvation, but as a just recompense of reward. Notice the following excerpts from my book:</p>
<p>"The Roman Catholic dogma of Purgatory was officially ratified at the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1438-45) and reaffirmed at the Council of Trent (1545-63). The concept was developed in the sixth century. Augustine (354-430) helped lay the foundation. Jerome (and many other early, professing Christians) taught that some Christians would be temporarily punished in fire, yet saved at last. Augustine, on the other hand, resisted this idea, and taught that any man that committed gross sins would burn eternally. Gregory the Great (540-604) would build upon Augustine's framework by teaching that there would be temporary punishment in fire for 'light' or venial sins, while all other sins would bring eternal damnation. Sufferings, whether for Christ (as a martyr) or for venial sins (in this life or in the intermediate state), were given redemptive value. The Biblical truths of millennial exclusion and millennial chastisement were perverted into Romeâ€™s monstrous Purgatory. Rome therefore compromised the grace of God as it relates to eternal salvation. The testimonies of the following accountability teachers will reveal the folly in branding chastisement (during the age of the millennial kingdom) as 'Purgatory.' It is an emotional straw man:</p>
<p>"Most will take up the ground - 'Chastisement, but only in this life.' Your proofs, friend?...you admit, that in spite of Jesus' atonement, the chastisements of God descend on the offending believer in this life. It is no bar then to their falling on him in the next age."<br />
(Robert Govett, 1813-1901)</p>
<p>"All denunciation of this truth as 'purgatory' condemns the Lord Jesus at least as sharply as it criticizes His commentator. Roman error on the point is lodged in making a believerâ€™s punishment hereafter a means to his fundamental salvation, an integral part of the Atonement."<br />
(D. M. Panton)</p>
<p>"It will be objected that this prospect of punishment after death for some who are ultimately to be saved savours of the Roman doctrine of purgatory. Stalwart Protestants will rush to the battle with the heaviest armaments they can command. But let the searcher for truth alone be calm.â€¦Every instructed Christian believes in purgatory in principle. The fire purges the gold that it may be fit for the kingâ€™s table. Heb.12:12; I Pet.1:6,7, indeed the whole Bible teaches this, nor is it questioned as to the ways of God our Father with His children in this life. It is therefore simply a question of whether God by His Word does or does not extend the application of this process to life after death. No new principle as to His ways is introduced. And who shall complain, or even wonder, should He thus vindicate His justice before men and angels? It is not fully exhibited in this life, even in the case of His children. The godly do not get a full reward of virtue, nor the carnal believer the due reward of his deeds. The former rightly look beyond death for their recompense; it is but consistent that the latter should then receive theirs.... This differs radically from the Romish doctrine of purgatory, for that dogma makes the suffering after death for such as go to purgatory necessary to their purification and final salvationâ€¦.Thus 'according to the Romanists the departed have to make an atonement themselves, in the purgatorial state, for the sins they have committed when in this life.' (Walter Hook, in Dr. W.F. Hookâ€™s Church Dictionary, 629)...."<br />
(G.H. Lang, 1874-1958)</p>
<p>SUMNER: "As for whether Romanists teach that Purgatory is 'to become a child of God' as he claims, let me quote one of his own authorities on the subject regarding Rome's position: 'The doctrine of purgatory does not, therefore, involve the idea of the future redemption of the impenitent. 'The souls who go to purgatory are only such as die in the state of grace, united to Jesus Christ. It is their imperfect works for which they are condemned to that place of suffering, which must all be consumed, and their stains purged away from them before they can go to heaven'....That sounds to me exactly what Faust is saying..."</p>
<p>Catholics do not mean by "grace" (i.e. "state of grace") what fundamental Christians mean by the word. They mean that the Catholic has lived a life of good deeds, sacraments and masses. He has earned the right (through God's grace) to go to Purgatory and atone for venial sins through suffering. It is all eternal salvation by grace AND WORKS from start to finish. The Catholic cannot possess absolute assurance of eternal salvation until after death. He must wait and make sure he does not fall out of a state of grace. If he does, he will be eternally damned. Yet, according to my view, a Christian can possess absolute assurance of salvation in eternity, and he does not have to wait his whole life to see if he remains in a "state of grace"(and was not simply a false professor with a false temporary faith). Unconfessed sin will result in chastisement on earth in this life. If God's earthly scourging is despised, or if the Christian faints, and he does not repent before it is too late, he will be in danger of scourging at the Judgment Seat. Yet none of this has anything to do with his salvation assurance, and none of his good works or sufferings (on earth or at the Judgment Seat) have any merit for eternal salvation.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "But who are the overcomers? By comparing Scripture with Scripture we have the answer: 'For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith...' And that is given in a context about believers as obedient commandment keepers (Vss.2,3), but who are called 'overcomers' because they trusted Christ, not because they were obedient to God's commands!..."</p>
<p>Sumner flees from the context of the Book of Revelation to John's 1st Epistle in an attempt to show that "overcomers" does not mean overcoming the temptations of the world and the Devil in the Christian life. In other words, he believes it only refers to a sinner exercising saving faith, and not to a believer exercising victorious faith and patience in the midst of temptations and persecutions.</p>
<p>Each time the "overcoming" promise is given in the Lord's words to the Seven Churches, it includes the following words: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the CHURCHES." John states that he is the "brother" of these Christians in these churches (Revelation 1:9). Why would Jesus be calling them to simply believe the Gospel? They already believe. But let us test Sumner's theory further:</p>
<p>Revelation 2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.<br />
11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that OVERCOMETH shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>
<p>Does "overcometh" sound like it refers to a sinner believing the Gospel in this passage? Is the devil casting unbelievers into prison? Are unbelievers called to be faithful until death?</p>
<p>Notice again:</p>
<p>Revelation 2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.<br />
25 But that which ye have already HOLD FAST till I come.<br />
26 And he that OVERCOMETH, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:<br />
27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>
<p>Does this sound like it refers to a sinner believing the Gospel for the first time? Or does it sound like believers in a church being exhorted to overcome the devil's fiery darts and endure to the end in holiness so they may reign with Christ in the Millennium?</p>
<p>Notice again:</p>
<p>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.<br />
22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
<p>Do all believers get to sit with Jesus in His throne during the Millennium? If "overcometh" only refers to a sinner believing the Gospel, then it would follow that all believers will get to reign with Jesus simply because they have believed. But what saith the Scriptures?:</p>
<p>2 Timothy 2:12 IF we SUFFER, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p>Christians who will not suffer against sin, the world and the devil for Jesus have no promise of reigning with Jesus in the Millennium.</p>
<p>Sumner makes many assumptions. He assumes that the 1st Epistle of John is using the word "overcometh" to refer to a sinner getting saved (and not to a believer overcoming the temptations of the world by a life of faith).</p>
<p>SUMNER: "We find it interesting that he introduced his chapter 'Trial By Fire' with a quote from Ambrose..."</p>
<p>It is not "strange" at all when a person reads the whole chapter. The last part of the same chapter begins with the following words:</p>
<p>"As with all the other truths Rome corrupted, the error of Purgatory is found growing out of a true doctrine the Lord gave to early Christians. The concept of Purgatory is therefore a perversion of truth instead of a whole new creation....During the process of writing this book, the writer decided to read through the writings of Sub-Apostolic Christians. He was amazed at how prevalent the teaching of 'trial by fire' was among these early writers. The writings of these so-called, early 'Church Fathers' are certainly not inspired. They contain errors. Nevertheless, with this Biblical understanding of a second death for some Christians at the judgment seat, many of the writings of these early Christians are made easier to comprehend. Even though much error was already creeping in, ushering in the infamous dark ages, it appears that many early Christians preserved seeds of truth (at least in regard to the Christianâ€™s future judgment and the millennial reign) that were taught by the holy apostles of the first century. Notice the following words [quotes]."</p>
<p>Sumner apparently wishes to leave his readers with the impression that I approve of all that Ambrose teaches. But any man who actually reads the chapter can plainly see why I quoted these early Christians.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "A 'literal fire'? Says who? If the fire is literal all the sense goes out of that Bema Seat passage in 1 Corinthians 3. It [sic] the fire is literal, so are the 'wood, hay and stubble'....if they are figurative, by the very basics of hermeneutics, so is the fire...."</p>
<p>Sumner does not refute the arguments I provided to support my conclusions. I will list some of them here. I spend a considerable amount of time proving that the chief JUDGMENT in parables and figures throughout Scripture (whether to unbelievers or disciples) is LITERAL, in spite of the illustrations which surround it:</p>
<p>Matthew 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to BURN them: but gather the wheat into my barn.<br />
37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;<br />
40 As therefore the tares are gathered and BURNED in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.<br />
41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;<br />
42 And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE...</p>
<p>Now let us remind ourselves of Sumner's words, which he stated so authoritatively, as if any true "scholar" is supposed to understand such things: "It [sic] the fire is literal, so are the 'wood, hay and stubble'....if they are figurative, by the very basics of hermeneutics, so is the fire.." Well then, does Sumner hold that unbelievers will meet with a FIGURATIVE BURNING? The "wheat" and "tares" are figurative. The "seed" is figurative. I suppose that means that the BURNING is figurative as well? Sumner is convinced that the "fire" in 1 Corinthians 3 is the "holiness of God." It think it is God Himself, the consuming fire, whose very breath ignites Tophet (Isaiah 30:33). But Sumner implies that the fire of God's holiness does not literally burn anyone. He writes, "There is all the terror we need: facing God's holiness with our puny works..." Sumner is now teaching a CATHOLIC PURGATORY with his Catholic view of assurance. Notice what modern Catholics now believe:</p>
<p>"My question concerns purgatory, which we hardly ever hear about any more....[Answer:] The hoary pictures of torture, pain, and a scourging God - which made of purgatory a kind of mini-hell - may literally scare the devil out of someone, but they're totally irrelevant to the doctrine of purgatory. These gory images grew up around the idea of purgatory through the Middle Ages....It is very possible that, in the burst of awareness of the reality of God and creation that might occur immediately after death, the pain that comes from the KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SINS and shortcomings might be so acute and intense that an entire purgatory - or cleansing, which is what the word purgatory means - could occur in an instant....The church hasn't attempted officially to satisfy our curiosity about such questions - and probably couldn't if it tried." (John J. Dietzen, "The New Question Box," 1988)</p>
<p>Since Rome has never officially defined Purgatory in detail, and since Catholics are now removing LITERAL and physical pain from the doctrine, Sumner is teaching something closer to modern Rome's Purgatory than I am! "There is all the terror we need: facing God's holiness with our puny works..." This is the accountability teaching of modern liberals and Catholics. Is this all the terror the unbeliever needs? If we are to follow Sumner's "basics of hermeneutics," we must conclude that the BURNING in the PARABLE of the Wheat and the Tares is ONLY figurative since if the wheat and the tares are figurative, so is the burning. This is his logic. But what saith the Lord? He states that the children of the devil will be burned in a LITERAL furnace of fire. Paul, as Jesus in Matthew 13, sums up his picture by showing that in spite of the illustrations, the JUDGMENT in the passage is literal:</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as BY FIRE.<br />
16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br />
17 If any man defile the temple of God, HIM shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</p>
<p>It is the carnal believer himself in verse 17 that is destroyed. He will be saved at last; yet so as by FIRE. Paul speaks of literal fire on other occasions:</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:26 For if WE sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,<br />
27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and FIERY indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not WE escape, if WE turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:<br />
29 For our God is a consuming FIRE.</p>
<p>All of these arguments are developed in detail in my 460 page book on the subject.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "Faust makes much of the passage in II Corinthians 5: 9-11...highlighting especially the phrase 'the terror of the Lord.'....The answer is simple. Without going into any great detail, here is one biblical illustration: Acts 9:31, "Then had the churches rest...and were edified; walking in the fear of the Lord...' The Greek there is the same as in II Corinthians 5:11. In one case it is the reaction at the Bema Seat, in the other (where there is certainly NO suggestion of ANY KIND of death), it is the reaction of Christians who are walking in the Spirit. So much for 'temporary death after death' for believers."</p>
<p>The word can mean fear or terror depending upon its context and usage. The Translators translated it as TERROR in 2 Corinthians 5:11. It is the same word in Acts 5:</p>
<p>Acts 5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great FEAR came on all them that heard these things.<br />
10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.<br />
11 And great FEAR came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</p>
<p>The Christians in Acts 9 are walking in the FEAR of God, the very fear they began to learn about in Acts 5. Sumner implies that the Christians in Acts 9 had no fear at all that God could kill them if they chose to lie to the Holy Ghost! But this is illogical. These Christians knew the goodness and the severity of God. If God would kill a couple for lying in the church in this day of grace, what would He do to unrepentant Christians on the day of judgment? Paul said, "knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." In the Bible, the true fear of God is something that brings literal TREMBLING and QUAKING (Phil.2:12, Hebrews 12:21). We know enough of what God can do and will do, according to His Word, to move us to persuade men to fear God and walk in obedience. 2 Corinthians 5:9-11 reveals that the same judgments we have seen fall upon Ananias and Sapphira (or worse) may befall carnal believers at the Judgment Seat!!</p>
<p>SUMNER: "It was regarding this verse [2 Corinthians 5:11] that he quoted John R. Rice, who didn't believe for a minute what Faust is teaching....Faust speaks of 'loss' as punishment, but that is NOT how Rice uses the term..."</p>
<p>One is almost tempted to think that brother Sumner is simply thumbing through the index of my book and looking for things to comment upon. Notice the passage out of my chapter and compare it to Sumner's claims above:</p>
<p>"There have been many Christian leaders that have properly applied this warning [ 2 Corinthians 5:9-11] to Christians; yet all too often, there has been a tendency in some teachers to water down the word terror or attempt to thrust it into obscurity:</p>
<p>'â€¦to face Christ at that time will be a terror to those who have failed to do His bidding after they were saved. I say 'terror' - that is exactly what Paul wrote of that time by inspiration of Godâ€¦I once thought that verse was speaking of the terror with which lost men will face Christ, but it is not soâ€¦In Heaven it will be terrible to face Christ who saved you and keeps you, in your shame over your wasted life!â€¦I am not speaking of punishment now, but of tears, of shame and sadness.' -John R. Rice (1895-1980)</p>
<p>Christian leaders that apply such warnings to believers should be commended. Yet, many fall short of correctly elucidating the warnings with other Scriptures. The Bible abounds with additional information on this subject. Paul uses the word terror to describe the power of the government to inflict death by the sword (Romans 13:3-4). Certainly, the Corinthians knew what Paul meant by the 'terror of the Lord'; he had warned them about it several times in his first Epistle to them..." [End of excerpt]</p>
<p>As can be seen by the a basic, left to right read of my book, John R. Rice is quoted in the context of people who did NOT embrace my view, but nevertheless, rightly applied the terror of the Lord to Christians.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "He quotes Dr. George W. Dollar repeatedly as one on his side, but, as I write this, Dollar has just denied to a long time friend that he holds Faust's position."</p>
<p>I just got off the phone with Dr. Dollar and he said he doesn't know what Sumner is talking about! He said he hasn't discussed my book with anyone. I quote brother Dollar as an historian and as a believer in outer darkness for carnal believers during the Millennium. So brother Sumner's is as off-target on this as he was on claiming Brother Bill Jackson was a Catholic priest, and the other quotes he took out of context in my book.</p>
<p>In spite of my obvious disagreements with brother Sumner, his review is the most detailed and lengthy critique to date. I am thankful that he took the time. I pray that the Holy Spirit will convict him through His Word to at least begin to move closer to my position. Modern fundamentalism needs it.</p>
<p>[See conclusion in part 2]</p>
<p>[Robert l. Sumner is the editor of The Biblical Evangelist]</p>
<p>A Protestant Purgatory! That is the title of Brother Sumner's review of my book. I will show that it might make a better title for HIS OWN theology. He is much more in line with Rome than I am. Myself (and the authors I quote as fellow advocates of my position) abhor the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, along with much of everything else that has to do with Rome. I pray that many dear Catholics will be delivered from her grasp. On the other hand, my opponents are apparently pleased with a ROMAN CATHOLIC Gospel of eternal salvation (i.e. assurance through works), if it means they can escape any "appearance" of Purgatory. But Old Mother Rome (Rev.17:5) has played a trick on them. Now that so many "evangelicals" are realizing that their view of salvation ASSURANCE is much the same as Rome's view, Rome has decided to change or ignore her view of Purgatory so that it comes into line with the modern, flowery, "evangelical" view of the Judgment Seat of Christ!</p>
<p>RESPONSE TO ROBERT L. SUMNER'S REVIEW (P.2)</p>
<p>SUMNER: "Faust attempts to answer Samuel L. Hoyt's articles in Bibliotheca Sacra about the Bema Seat, but he is not very successful. He quotes him about 'receiving back' for bad works: 'The answer lies in the fact that unworthy, sinful deeds merit no reward....Reward will be granted only for righteous deeds.' Faust answers, 'Reward can either be positive or NEGATIVE' (his emphasis) and to prove it he offers Romans 11:22 (the goodness and severity of God...'...Alas, again he has taken a text out of context. Paul was talking about the favor of God in this passage, cutting off Israel and grafting in the church....Was he talking about both 'goodness' and 'severity' for the children of God? Of course, not! The severity was for, as the passage plainly notes, 'unbelievers.'..."</p>
<p>By choosing this verse to comment upon, brother Sumner implies that Romans 11 is my primary proof that rewards are both positive and negative. While I certainly believe my application of that Scripture is warranted, I actually have two whole chapters on the subject in my book (i.e. "Negative Rewards in This Life" and "Negative Rewards at the Judgment Seat"). Here are some excerpts from the section in my book that Sumner is commenting upon above:</p>
<p>"Proverbs 26:10 The great God that formed all things both REWARDETH the fool, and REWARDETH transgressors.</p>
<p>'This Bema (translated 'judgment seat') is to dispense not only happy rewardings but also the opposite.'<br />
(W.F. Roadhouse, 1875-1951)</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we MAY be ACCEPTED of him.<br />
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may RECEIVE the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or BAD.<br />
11 Knowing therefore the TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men;</p>
<p>If Bible words mean anything, then there was some sense in which Paul labored to be accepted. Notice the phrase "the terror of the Lord." Paul knew it. Yet, it appears that modern Christendom's view of God is severely deficient. The Bible's numerous warnings to the saints are therefore denied at all costs.</p>
<p>On this passage in 2 Corinthians 5, Samuel L. Hoyt writes:</p>
<p>'The question this verse raises is how one 'receives back' what Paul calls 'bad.' The things a believer receives back for his good works are obviously rewards, but how can one receive back for sinful works without some sort of punishment involved? The answer rests in the fact that unworthy, sinful deeds merit no rewardâ€¦Reward will be granted only for righteous deeds.'</p>
<p>Hoyt has failed to realize that the Bible teaches that 'rewards' are often given in the form of punishments! Reward can be either positive or NEGATIVE:</p>
<p>Romans 11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, IF THOU continue in his goodness: otherwise THOU also shalt be cut off.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:30 For WE know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will RECOMPENSE, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge HIS PEOPLE.</p>
<p>Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus unto HIS DISCIPLES, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<br />
27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall REWARD every man according to his WORKS.</p>
<p>When defining the word 'reward,' Noah Webster comments on Matthew 16:27:</p>
<p>'In the latter passage, reward signifies to render both good and evil.'.." [end of excerpt]</p>
<p>My arguments above reveal that Hoyt (and Sumner, who is attempting to defend him) is wrong in his interpretation of 2 Corinthians 5:9-11. Is it not obvious that the heart of man will do almost anything in interpretation to escape accountability? Does not the Bible itself predict that such will be the state of much of Christendom in the last days?</p>
<p>Hoyt takes Paul's clear warning about RECEIVING back for good AND BAD (followed by a reference to "terror"), and tells us that the "receiving" is actually "NOT receiving"! To defend such a twisting of the text, Hoyt teaches that it is possible since REWARDS are ONLY positive in nature. Therefore, to be rewarded for bad would actually mean to receive NOTHING. Hoyt and Sumner both embrace this idea even though the English dictionary and the Bible itself define the word "reward" as having to do with the rendering of blessings and/or PUNISHMENTS. Notice the following Scripture:</p>
<p>Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;<br />
24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the REWARD of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.<br />
25 But he that doeth wrong shall RECEIVE for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
<p>This word "receive" in verse 25 is the word used in 2 Corinthians 5:9-11. Colossians 3 is a warning to Christians (as is 2 Corinthians 5:9-11). Does the person in Colossians 3:25 "receive for the wrong" by receiving NOTHING? He will certainly miss the reward of verse 24. But that will not be the end of it. He will obviously also RECEIVE something.</p>
<p>And if we are to believe that "receive" and "reward" are only positive in nature, what are we to do with the following Scripture?:</p>
<p>2 Peter 2:13 And shall RECEIVE THE REWARD OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</p>
<p>Perhaps Sumner would tell us: "Since these spots will not receive a reward, what they will really receive is nothing, since to not earn a reward is to not get one." This is absurd. What about this Scripture:</p>
<p>Luke 23:41 And we indeed justly; for we RECEIVE THE DUE REWARD of OUR DEEDS: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a person telling these men on their crosses that their crucifixions were simply illusions, since the "receiving" of "due reward" simply means they do not get a prize? Sumner at times stresses the "Bema seat," as if such a Judgment Seat (KJV) cannot administer PUNISHMENTS. Yet, both of these thieves (as well as our Lord Himself) once stood before Pilate's BEMA SEAT (John 19:13)! They were not awarded with prizes. They were not told that they will receive "nothing." They were crucified. Therefore, a "Bema Seat" is a Judgment Seat. It can administer positive or negative "rewards."</p>
<p>In regard to the word "reward" (although proof has already been provided), notice one last Scripture:</p>
<p>Revelation 18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</p>
<p>Does this mean that Babylon will simply end up missing a prize? Will there be no actual negative judgment administered?</p>
<p>SUMNER: "It is interesting what Faust didn't quote in the Hoyt item above (the ellipsis). Here is missing a section, which offers solid explanation: 'An unfaithful Christian receives the appropriate recompense for that which is worthless, namely no recompense at all. For example, a student who turns in a worthless assignment receives a failing grade. He receives what he deserves....Likewise the unfaithful Christian will receive the commensurate recompense for his worthless works. He will receive no reward at all for those particular deeds.' Amen!"</p>
<p>Can it really be said in the English language that a student who turns in a worthless assignment and receives a failing grade receives "no recompense" at all? By what dictionary is "recompense" said to be only positive? The Bible certainly does not use the word in this manner:</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will RECOMPENSE, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.<br />
31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every TRANSGRESSION and disobedience received a just RECOMPENCE OF REWARD;</p>
<p>Failing grades, if continued, may result in flunking school (or at least this used to be the case). The exact nature and degree of the consequences for laziness or rebellion depend upon the situation. A man on parole who fails to report, or who leaves a designated area, may end up back in prison. The consequences for lying in Acts 5 was death. The consequences for not discerning the Lord's body in 1 Corinthians 11 were sickness and death. This is in the day of God's longsuffering. What shall be the recompense for those who refuse to heed God's earthly warnings?</p>
<p>If to "receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad," ONLY means to fail to receive the prize (which it doesn't), what would it prove? The positive reward for obedience and faithfulness is entrance and reign in the Millennial Kingdom (2 Timothy 2:12, Matthew 18:3, Acts 14:22, Hebrews 4:1,11, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, etc.). The man who does not receive this prize in Matthew 25:30, goes into outer darkness.</p>
<p>SUMNER: "There is nothing here to indicate Christians will be cast into outer darkness for over 1,000 years to be punished for their failures."</p>
<p>I glean from 2 Corinthians 5:9-11 what it teaches. It teaches that some true believers will nevertheless receive for bad deeds, and it will be TERRIBLE! The details of this punishment are not given since they are supplied by other Scriptures. Sumner throughout his entire review scarcely offers an explanation of the Lord's warning parables to His disciples. Yet, these are the words that teach the details concerning where the unfaithful believer spends the duration of the Kingdom. These are also the very words that Paul told us some men would try to ignore (1 Timothy 6:3-5). We might remind Sumner that there is also nothing in 2 Corinthians 5:9-11 that states, "This warning is not as bad as it sounds. In Greek, the word for 'terror' here only means 'fear.' The 'receiving' for bad deeds really only means not receiving for the good deeds." When Sumner finds this exact wording for his view anywhere in the Bible, we will also show him the exact wording he is looking for! Let me make it easier for him. Where does the Bible state (in exact words): "No Christian will be punished at the Judgment Seat of Christ." Sumner's objection is like the J. W.'s asking us where the word "Trinity" is found in the Bible. I tell them the exact word is found in the same place the exact phrases "Jehovah's Witness," "Kingdom Hall," and "ransom sacrifice" are found! Sumner knows that I can show numerous places where believers are warned of stripes, outer darkness, fire, hell, and exclusion. I assume Sumner interprets these as applying only to "pretend" Christians. Yet, he thereby logically destroys the Biblical doctrine of assurance for believers. And he cannot find the words, "false Christian," "fake Christian," "false professor," "professor," "pretend Christian," anywhere in his Bible, no matter how hard he tries. There are certainly a multitude of people (mainly in cults and liberal churches) who claim to be Christians but are not born again. However, it is irresponsible to apply warnings directed to true Christians to "false Christians."</p>
<p>Sumner: "Doesn't Faust know that 'bad deeds/works' are SINS and for him to say believers will be 'punished' for them (instead of 'suffering loss' by losing rewards) is an insult to the finished work of Christ?"</p>
<p>No, what is an insult to the "finished work of Christ" is for these brethren to pervert the Gospel of salvation in ETERNITY in a mad attempt to escape TEMPORARY punishment. Does a "professor" have to wait until after death to have ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE (as Rome and the Evangelicals who signed E.C.T. teach)? Any man who teaches that a person's absolute assurance of eternal salvation is based on fruit-bearing (and not Christ's Blood shed on the Cross) is Popish! But this is exactly the conclusion that Sumner must embrace if he will tell us that the warnings addressed to believers throughout Scripture (concerning CONDUCT) are to "false professors." This means he must wait till after death to ask God whether or not he measured up. How many sins make one a false professor? How long must one persist in these sins to prove he is not a real Christian? It is amazing that after embracing this Gospel-compromising, Rome appeasing system of interpretation, these men will dare accuse me of denying the finished work of Christ on the Cross for teaching that a believer may receive at the Judgment Seat what many ALREADY receive in this life, in the age of God's patience! Surely Sumner knows that I wrote a whole book on this subject. Why doesn't he deal with the answer I give? I even catalogued the objections in a chapter all to itself so it will be easy to find. Here is the objection answered on page 284 of my book:</p>
<p>"Did Not Jesus Pay for Our Sins at Calvary? - Jesus paid for all our sins, past, present and future, as far as eternal salvation is concerned. No sin can ever rob a believer of eternal life on the Last Day (after the millennium). Yet, there are sins that Christians commit as children of God. And Godâ€™s children are held accountable for their faults (if they do not confess their transgressions and seek mercy in fear). If Jesus is not free to judge unfaithfulness at the judgment seat, He is not free to judge it in this present life. Yet, almost all commentators admit that the Lord judges His saints in this life (1 Corinthians 11, Hebrews 12). The distinction in Scripture is therefore, between temporary and eternal judgment. Christians can never be judged eternally for their sins since Jesus has paid the full price for them on the Cross. Yet, the sins of believers can bring temporal judgments, and the millennium is temporal. The forgiveness of sins in regard to believers is not automatic, and it must be maintained (Matthew 6:15, 18:35, 1 John 1:9)."</p>
<p>Sumner never tells us why sinful believers do not simply "suffer loss by losing rewards" in this life. The Judgment Seat of which Scripture continually warns has not yet arrived. Yet, God does more to erring Christians (for whom Christ died) IN THIS LIFE, than Sumner believes He will do at the actual Judgment Seat! God at times makes them sick, and at other times He slays them (1 Corinthians 11:30). The Bible calls this "scourging" (Hebrews 12:6), which is a harsher word than punishment itself! Sumner never tells us by what logic we are to conclude that sickness, afflictions, and death as chastisements for sin in this life do not take away from Christ's work on the Cross, but TEMPORARY, literal chastisements on the day of JUDGMENT does take away from the Cross. This strange disfigurement is perhaps derived from the old Catholic/Protestant amillennialism and postmillennialism which was not aware of the intervening Millennium between this age and eternity.</p>
<p>Christians can SIN (2 Corinthians 12:21, 1 John 5:16). And sin (unless God exercises mercy beforehand) can be recompensed by God in this life (1 Corinthians 10:10, 11:30-31), and at the Judgment Seat (Hebrews 10:26-27, Colossians 3:25, Luke 12:45-46, etc.). Such temporary chastisement does not in any manner minimize the eternal work of Christ on the Cross. Ironically, it actually guards it. The Christian may now have absolute assurance of ETERNAL life (based fully on Christ's blood), since all unfaithfulness is simply evidence of impending, temporary punishment at the Judgment Seat and during the Millennium - not eternal torment.</p>
<p>Sumner: "The author needs to settle in his mind whether or not 'bad works' are 'sins.' If they are, it is unquestionably a horrible case of double jeopardy..."</p>
<p>This manipulation of sound words is a proof of the lawless nature of this age. My book answers Sumner's question:</p>
<p>"Doesnâ€™t the Bible Teach That Our 'Works' (and Not Our 'Sins') Will Be Judged? - S.S. Craig (1855-1936) answers this objection: 'On this passage [2 Cor. 5:10] Dr. Scofield comments as follows: 'The judgment of the believer's works, not sins, is in question hereâ€¦Matt. 10:12; Rom. 14:10; Gal. 6:7; Eph. 6:8; Col. 3:24, 25â€¦'â€¦Matt. 10:12â€¦has no bearing on the subject whatever. Eph. 6:8 has reference to the Christian's good deeds, but says nothing of the evil; and the other three passages affirm the very opposite of the Doctor's contention. How very emphatic is Col. 3:25: 'But He that doeth wrong (assuming that he has not made it right) shall receive for the wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons.' Surely that is plain enough. Those who hold the theory in question say it is the believer's works and not his person that is to be judged. Is it conceivable that an evil work, apart from the person who does it, can be judged, the sentence executed and justice satisfied thereby? How would the theory work in civil jurisprudence? Suppose society should say, 'We will let the murderer go free, but we will judge and punish the deed.'â€¦Christ bore the believer's sin and sins on the cross judicially. But this will not save the believer from sinning; nor from reaping as he sows.'</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christians can be judged for 'sins' (1 John 5:16-17, James 1:15, 2:9, Hebrews 10:26, Romans 6:16, 1 Timothy 5:24). There must be a distinction made between position and practice (i.e. walk). No believer will be punished judicially for sins after salvation in a positional, eternal sense. However, there are temporal judgments (in this life and during the millennium) for sin in believers. The semantic distinction that is often made between bad works and sins is erroneous. Evil works are sins." [end of excerpt]</p>
<p>Sumner: "Faust argues that since chastening and scourging are the lot of Christians in this life it follows the same kind of response will be true after death for those who need it. That reasoning is not necessarily true, but much of what he says pursues that idea. In fact, what is God's purpose in chastening His children in this life?...One purpose is to make us partakers of His holiness. That will have already been accomplished before the Bema Seat..."</p>
<p>I am glad that Sumner finally gets around to meeting this argument. I have maintained that if literal, temporal chastisement in this life does not minimize the Cross, then neither will literal, temporal chastisement on the day of the Judgment Seat minimize it. Sumner argues against this by rephrasing my argument somewhat and then saying that this is not necessarily true. But that is not an argument. But what of Sumner's appeal to God's purposes in chastisement? It is agreed that one purpose of chastisement in this life is to make us holy. But another purpose is to show that God is not MOCKED:</p>
<p>Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; GOD IS NOT MOCKED: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p>
<p>Another purpose (stated in Scripture) is to keep us from being judged with the unbelievers at the Lord's coming:</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we SHOULD NOT BE condemned WITH the world. (see also 1 Corinthians 5:5)</p>
<p>Often believers react to chastisements by DESPISING them (Proverbs 3:11). If we ignore these warnings to repent, we will indeed be condemned with the world (not eternally, but during the Millennium):</p>
<p>Luke 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion WITH THE UNBELIEVERS.</p>
<p>The unbelievers do not enter the Kingdom; neither do believers who fail to heed and respond to the Lord's earthly chastisements. Sumner has set up a straw man by LIMITING the purposes of God. Making believers holy is only ONE of His purposes in chastisement. If we are tempted to despise these earthly chastenings, we are met with the warning of "so much SORER punishment" at the Judgment Seat. If we fail to hear this warning, God will be just. He is not mocked. He cannot deny Himself. He will do what He has threatened to do.</p>
<p>This idea that all scourging is ONLY to make us holy does not stand up to Scripture. Ananias and Sapphira, and some believers in Corinth were actually slain! God obviously has manifold purposes for chastening His people. And if scourging in this life does not take away from the Cross, then neither does temporary scourging at the Judgment Seat.</p>
<p>Sumner: "Who will have praise of God when Christ comes to judge His own? Paul says 'every man!'"</p>
<p>This is an incredible interpretation of 1 Corinthians 4:5. I have only seen one other man (i.e. Herb Evans) maintain that ALL believers will be praised at the Judgment Seat! This is certainly Laodicean wishful thinking. The passage means that on the day of judgment it will not be MAN who will be doing the judging, it will be GOD. Ironside is correct in regard to this verse when he states: "The context, however, seems to show that it is a question of the source from which the praise comes, rather than an affirmation that all will have praise." The Universalists (who believe every human being will eventually be saved) would agree with Sumner that "every" means "every" in 1 Corinthians 4:5. Therefore, I am sure Sumner would reply that "every" must be taken in a relative sense to mean "every Christian." I likewise reply that "every" must be taken in a relative sense to mean "every faithful Christian"!</p>
<p>Sumner: "the saved will be delivered...even such backsliding creatures as Lot, who certainly deserve the harshest punishment....But to say that the Lots are to be punished with the unjust is certainly going far beyond what is written."</p>
<p>Lot is an example of a believer who barely escapes the judgment of death. He nevertheless suffers great consequences. Although Lot is an example of escaping earthly punishments (though barely), I am sure there will be many Christians at the Judgment Seat of Christ who will only have an hair-breadth escape from Millennial exclusion. They will enter the Millennial Kingdom, but will have a lower position that others (Matthew 5:19). If Lot pictures (among other things) a believer who will barely make it into the Millennial Kingdom, LOT'S WIFE pictures those Christians who will miss the Kingdom! Jesus warns His disciples to REMEMBER Lot's WIFE. There are too many Christian teachers today who only remember LOT!:</p>
<p>Luke 17:22 And he said unto the DISCIPLES, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it...<br />
32 Remember Lot's wife.</p>
<p>Lot's wife was punished WITH the unbelievers (Matthew 24:51). The angels laid hold on Lot's wife and brought her out of Sodom. The Lord is also very merciful to many believers today. He keeps us from many temptations. But when we presume upon His mercies and provisions, we are in grave danger at the Judgment Seat:</p>
<p>Hebrews 3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:<br />
9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.<br />
12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<br />
14 For we are made partakers of Christ, IF WE hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;<br />
19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
<p>Sumner: "...[Faust] then adds, 'There is nothing figurative about the words of Philippians 3:11. To spiritualize the resurrection in that chapter is to cast doubt on the literalness of any resurrection, in any verse.' Is that true? Alas, the resurrection in verse 10 cannot be a literal resurrection because it comes BEFORE the suffering!"</p>
<p>If there ever was an example of arguing beside the point it is

<blockquote>â€œNASHVILLE, Tenn. â€“ In the old translation of the worldâ€™s most popular Bible, John the Evangelist declares: â€œIf anyone says, â€˜I love God,â€™ yet hates his brother, he is a liar.â€ Make that â€œbrother or sisterâ€ in a new translation that includes more gender-neutral language and is drawing criticism from some conservatives who argue the changes can alter the theological message.Â The 2011 translation of the New International Version Bible, or NIV, does not change pronouns referring to God, who remains â€œHeâ€ and â€œthe Father.â€ But it does aim to avoid using â€œheâ€ or â€œhimâ€ as the default reference to an unspecified person.Â The NIV Bible is used by many of the largest Protestant faiths. The translation comes from an independent group of biblical scholars that has been meeting yearly since 1965 to discuss advances in biblical scholarship and changes in English usageâ€¦

Before the new translation even hit stores, it drew opposition from the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, an organization that believes women should submit to their husbands in the home and only men can hold some leadership roles in the church.

The council decided it would not endorse the new version because the changes alter â€œthe theological direction and meaning of the text,â€ according to a statement. Similar concerns led the Southern Baptist Convention to reject the NIVâ€™s previous translation in 2005.

At issue is how to translate pronouns that apply to both genders in the ancient Greek and Hebrew texts but have traditionally been translated using masculine forms in English.

An example from the translatorâ€™s notes for Mark 4:25 to show how the NIVâ€™s translation of these words has evolved over the past quarter-century.

The widely distributed 1984 version of the NIV quotes Jesus: â€œWhoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.â€

The ultimate goal is to bring about a new â€œbibleâ€ that makes God gender-neutral. The goal of Satan is androgyny! Man must become androgynous. To accomplish this, the leadership of men must be usurped. The occultists have always maintained that Adam was created androgynous, and that the kingdom of God would arrive when men and women are not seen as different sexes. This is the Satanic reason for the whole cross-dressing movement. The NIV was first birthed with two known homosexuals working on the translation. It appears they now think the climate is financially safe to bring about a gender-neutral edition. It will get worse â€“ Satan will make sure of it. Rebuke this version with all your might â€“ and cling to the old King James Bible!

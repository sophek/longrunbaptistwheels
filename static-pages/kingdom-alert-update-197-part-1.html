WHY WOMEN SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN OUR CHURCHES    (By Joey Faust)

Revelation 2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because
thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to
teach...

1 Timothy 2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man,
but to be in silence.
13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the
transgression.

1 Corinthians 14:34 Let your women keep SILENCE in the CHURCHES: for it is
not permitted unto them to SPEAK; but they are commanded to be under
obedience, as also saith the law.
38 But if any man be IGNORANT, let him be ignorant.

Introduction

Paul (as in 1 Corinthians 14:38), continually views the contentious,
emotional stubbornness of many Christians (especially in regard to the
women who control them) as something practically insurmountable. Yet,
there ARE many who are open to information. Therefore, this article is
offered in this perilous hour to all who are willing to reason upon the
subject of women speaking in the church. It is also hoped that it will
encourage others who have already chosen to obey God's commandments
concerning women in our churches.

The conclusion of this article is that women are permitted to teach and
testify among women, teach children, and testify and pray aloud with men
in private, small group, and non-church situations. They are also allowed
to sing among the mixed church assembly. Yet, in regard to regular
speaking, they are called to remain silent in the mixed church assembly
(i.e. any time the "church" is gathered). This holy silence is a form of
submission. Among other things, it is a sign that communicates to the
assembly (especially the growing children), God's order for the church and
home. Homosexuality did not grow to be accepted overnight. The
denominations did not get to the place to where they have to debate
ordaining women (or homosexuals!) overnight. The minor rules that we may
think are unnecessary, when ignored, have far reaching implications for
Christians and society over time. This is why we should not lean unto our
own understanding (Proverbs 3:5-7).
 
Everything and everyone in God's creation has its own sphere in which to
prosper. Sin is rebellion against God and His commands. It is therefore
sinful for any angels, men, women, or children to leave the PLACE that God
has ordained for them. Lucifer and his angels attempted to leave their
domain on earth and desired to be like God in the Heavens (Isaiah 14:13).
Eve was also deceived by Satan into thinking that there was a better place
("as gods") for her than the place and position that God has ordained.
Likewise, another group of perverted angels once left their assigned
place:

Jude 1:6 And the angels which KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST ESTATE, but LEFT their
own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
the judgment of the great day.

Both Jude and Peter, when describing the final falling away, reveal that
professing Christians will be rebellious against godly AUTHORITY. They
will leave their places in a mad, Satanic lust for LIBERTY against God's
commandments and ordained ORDER:

2 Peter 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
there SHALL BE false teachers among you...
10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,
and DESPISE GOVERNMENT. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not
afraid to speak evil of dignities.
19 While they promise them LIBERTY, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.

This final, Laodicean rebellion will have a form of godliness (i.e.
"spirituality"). It will, therefore, deceive many women:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times shall
come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, DISOBEDIENT to parents, unthankful, unholy...
5 Having a FORM OF GODLINESS, but denying the power thereof: from such
turn away.
6 For OF THIS SORT are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
SILLY WOMEN laden with sins, LED AWAY with divers lusts...

Some women in the last days will be led "away." They will be led away FROM
the place and position that God has assigned for them:

2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure SOUND
DOCTRINE; but after their own LUSTS shall they heap to themselves
teachers, having itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto fables.

Silly women (the opposite of wise women) will be led away by their lusts
(2 Timothy 3:6, 4:3). Eve was led away by her lust for POWER. Many women,
in these last days, will be led away (in various degrees) in a lust for
more power and authority. "Laodicea" (Revelation 3:14) means "rights of
the people." They will find God's commandments to be vexing and
constraining. They will not endure SOUND DOCTRINE (2 Timothy 4:3). "Sound
doctrine" is found in Titus 2:

Titus 2:1 But speak thou the things which become SOUND DOCTRINE:
2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
charity, in patience.
3 The AGED WOMEN likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness,
not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of GOOD THINGS;
4 That they may teach the YOUNG WOMEN to be sober, to love their husbands,
to love their children,
5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
 
This passage in Titus 2:5 explains clearly what many of our churches in
the last days will depart from! While the final rebellion is by no means
limited to women, the Holy Ghost clearly reveals that SILLY WOMEN (and the
false teachers who prey upon them for money - see 2 Peter 2:3) will be one
of the reasons that the final age will be extremely dangerous. These false
teachers will "creep" into the houses (e.g. television, radio, computer,
etc.) and promise these "religious" women LIBERTY (2 Peter 2:19). They
will use smooth words to lead many "devout" women away from such "good
things" (Titus 2:3) as motherhood, the home, obedience to husbands,
immoveable affection for their husbands and children, modesty, and SILENCE
IN THE MIXED CHURCH ASSEMBLY. But Satanic freedom is not true freedom (2
Peter 2:19-20). It is the slippery slope back down to the Prodigal's mire
(2 Peter 2:22, Luke 15:16). With this introduction, let us now take a look
at some general history in regard to women speaking in professing
Christian churches.

The Quakers and the Methodists

The Bible teaches that "evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
deceiving, and being deceived" ( 2 Timothy 3:13). Therefore, any view
concerning holiness in these last days that departs radically from what
godly Christians have always believed throughout history should be
immediately questioned; especially when it is forced to use radical
translations, etc., for its own defense. Christian history cannot be used
to prove doctrine. Yet, when it is almost entirely against us, it should
certainly be used as a red-light, calling for a closer, Biblical
examination of our doctrinal views.

Most professing Christians in history have obeyed God's commands
concerning women which He gave through the apostle Paul. Robert E.
Billings, Jr., writes:

"From the time of the Reformation in the 16th Century, until some time in
the 1970s, there is virtually no record of women speaking in Evangelical
churches. However, today, with increasing frequency, churches that have
historically been Evangelical are allowing women to speak at the meeting
of the church....Feminism teaches that there are no significant
distinctions between male and female and that the sex roles in society are
interchangeable. All these views are antithetical to the Word of God. The
Humanist, the Relativist, and the Feminist would all say that in any
organization, including churches, women should do the same things as men
and that men should do the same things as women. But the Bible does not
teach this."
("Should Women Speak in the Church Meeting?," Everyday Publications)

There have certainly been some exceptions. The heretical George Fox
(1624-1691) and his radical Quaker followers (e.g. Margaret Fell) had
already attempted to apply Paul's admonitions for women to be silent to
specific churches in Paul's day, thus allowing future women to ignore the
commands. George Fox would, therefore, certainly be a historical
application of 2 Timothy 3:6.

Later, John Wesley and the early Methodists reasoned that perhaps God had
a greater role for women that was not being realized. He came close to the
Scriptural ideal by separating small "society" meetings from the church
assembly, and allowing women to pray aloud and testify (but not to teach
or preach) in these small groups. However, the lines became blurry when
these meetings began to grow in numbers, and the women began to call for a
clear distinction between "exhorting" and actual preaching. Men such as
Wesley (and later Finney) were correct in realizing that women should be
involved in active evangelism. They were, however, very wrong by sometimes
(though with hesitation) endorsing women to speak in churches. After
Wesley's death (1791), Methodists, for a time, put a lid on women speaking
in their churches. However, the door had been opened, and the great good
that was performed by the early Methodists would be used to justify
disobedience to 1 Corinthians 14:34 and 1 Timothy 2:11 for centuries to
come.

Yet, the fight was on. For example, in 1832, the general Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church in America, approved a document stating:

"Meetings of pious women by themselves, for conversation and prayer,
whenever they can conveniently be held, we entirely approve. But let not
the inspired prohibitions of the great apostle of the Gentiles, as found
in his epistles to the Corinthians and to Timothy, be violated. To teach
and exhort, or to lead in prayer, in public and promiscuous assemblies, is
clearly forbidden to women in the Holy Oracles."

In the first half of the 19th century, not only did women NOT speak in
most churches (except in Quaker groups, etc.), it was actually considered
highly improper for a woman to address ANY mixed audience:

"The debate over women's involvement in the American Anti-Slavery Society
dated all the way back to its founding in 1833....the joint participation
of men and women in public meetings was considered most improper....By
1840, however, women were speaking and holding office in some of the local
AASS. organizations....It is this...that caused the AASS to split apart at
its national meeting in May 1840."
(Norma Johnson, "Remember The Ladies: The First Women's Rights
Convention," Scholastic, 1995)

Even Queen Victoria, at the time, let her husband speak for her when
addressing mixed assemblies.

The Antichristian Feminists

By 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) had launched the first Women's
Rights Convention with Lucretia Mott (1793-1880), who was a well-known
Quaker. The advertisement for the convention itself was morally shocking
at the time:

"On Friday the notice appeared in small print before the 'Courier'
readership's astonished eyes: 'Women's Rights Convention - A convention to
discuss the social, civil, and RELIGIOUS condition and rights of woman,
will be held in the Wesleyan Chapel, at Seneca Falls, N.Y....During the
first day the meeting will be exclusively for women, who are earnestly
invited to attend. The PUBLIC GENERALLY are invited to be present on the
second day, when Lucretia Mott, of Philadelphia, and other ladies and
gentlemen, will address the convention.'....It seemed innocent
enough....But buried beneath the small print were inflammatory words and
phrases...'The public generally are invited...'...that meant a
'promiscuous assembly,' men and women mixed, most improper."
(Norma Johnson, "Remember The Ladies")

Before this first convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton met with other ladies
at the home of Mary Ann McClintock. At McClintock's mahogany
"spiritualist" table, Stanton quickly drafted the Satanically inspired,
"Declaration of Rights and Sentiments." Radical feminism was born. Even at
its birth, it did not hide that its ultimate goal was to rewrite the Holy
Scriptures. The new Declaration objected:

"He [males] allows her in Church, as well as State, but a subordinate
position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from the
ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public participation in the
affairs of the Church."

On July 20th, 1848, these early feminists passed the following resolution:

"Resolved, That inasmuch as man, while claiming for himself intellectual
superiority, does accord to woman moral superiority, it is pre-eminently
his duty to encourage her to speak, and teach, as she has an opportunity,
in ALL religious assemblies....it is time she should move in the enlarged
sphere which her Creator has assigned her."

Decades later, Stanton would birth and edit the blasphemous, "Women's
Bible" (1895). In it, this mother of feminism would write:

"Come, come, my conservative friend, wipe the dew off your spectacles, and
see that the world is moving....your political and social degradation are
but an outgrowth of your status in the Bible."

She stated that the Scriptures were NOT inspired, and that they must be
rewritten, with certain parts deleted! In its commentary on Paul's
commands concerning women speaking in churches, Louisa Southwort in "The
Woman's Bible" (p. 159) writes:

 "...should it be so often quoted as having Divine sanction?"

She argued that it was unlikely that Paul actually wrote the command for
women to remain silent in the churches. She argued that if he did, it is
unlikely that is was based on an inspired command from God. Stanton
herself argues:

"The church at Corinth was peculiarly given to diversion and to
disputation; and women were apt to join in and to ask many troublesome
questions; hence they were advised to consult their husbands at home."
(p.159)

Another writer, in this blasphemous commentary, argues:

"This mother and grandmother under whose teaching Timothy had become
qualified to receive the important office of bishop...were required to
keep silence in the Church equally with all other women whose evidence of
faith were not so conclusive....The ban was placed upon women solely on
the ground of sex. The Church has only in this nineteenth century
partially amended this record, by establishing the order of deaconesses
for women who devote themselves to good works and religious teaching.
While in the liberal denominations the pulpit is accessible to woman, it
is only in recent years that in any evangelistic denomination it has been
permissible for woman to 'teach.' The priesthood are as unwilling today as
was Paul in the first century, that women shall be placed on an equality
in offices of distinction. perhaps this disposition comes of a dim, not
fully evolved consciousness that, 'when the present evolution of woman is
complete, a new world will result; for woman is destined to rule the
world...'....Until the feminine is recognized in the Divine Being, and
justice is established in the Church by the complete equality of woman
with man, the Church cannot be thoroughly Christian."
(Lucinda B. Chandler, p.179)

This is how the 19th century ended. Spiritualism and Theosophy had joined
hands with  antichristian feminism to "go for the throat" of the apostle
Paul. One by one, all of the denominations and churches would become
embarrassed before the eyes of the world and would begin to bend Paul's
inspired commands concerning women.

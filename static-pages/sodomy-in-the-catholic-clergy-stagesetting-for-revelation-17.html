        <h1>SODOMY IN THE CATHOLIC CLERGY: STAGESETTING FOR REVELATION 17</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 30 - AIDS has quietly caused the deaths of hundreds of Roman Catholic priests in the United States although other causes may be listed on some of their death certificates, The Kansas City Star reported in its Sunday editions. In the first of a three-part series, the newspaper reported that its examination of death certificates and interviews with experts indicated several hundred priests had died of AIDS-related illnesses since the mid-1980s and hundreds more are living with HIV, the virus that causes the disease. The death rate of priests from AIDS is at least four times that of the general population, the newspaper said...." (AP, 2000)

"Los Angeles - More than 100 people in the nation's largest Catholic diocese have complained to authorities in recent months of sexual abuse by priests, authorities said Thursday....Authorities said the complaints in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles surfaced after the priest abuse scandal emerged in Boston in March, then erupted nationally....Officials with the Archdiocese of Anchorage said national guidelines adopted at a Roman Catholic bishops conference are flawed but a crucial first step in publicly dealing with pedophile priests...." (AP, June 21, 2002)

The media (at least in the news reports I have read online) has been busy reporting on the scandals occurring in the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, the true sin ("sodomy") is not named. A generic, politically correct phrase such as "sexual abuse" is often used to soften the blow to the media's favorite "Christian" denomination, and keep the homosexuals happy and "gay." What will be the general, ultimate response to the now widely publicized sodomy, child abuse, drug dealing, and disgusting perversion in the Roman Catholic clergy? These sins among the clergy are nothing new. In spite of feigned outrage, they will be largely ignored, just as they always have been.

Whatever the responses, two things are certain. First, the Bible predicts that Rome, and her religion headquartered there, will be a worldwide center of fornications and moral perversion:

Revelation 17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

There is a figurative fornication revealed in Revelation 17. It speaks of the political courting of this so-called church, and her unholy union of church and state (Revelation 17:2, 18). Yet, she is also the mother of the ABOMINATIONS of the earth. Sodomy is an abomination (Leviticus 20:13). Therefore, Rome will also be the root and haven of LITERAL fornication and abominations. Like both the Rome of ancient days, and Rome throughout the dark ages, Rome future (and its religion) will continue to become the center and shelter of LITERAL sexual perversion! The woman's cup is filled with FORNICATION and abominations (17:4). The fact that this is also literal (as well as containing figurative truth) can be seen from the fact that the woman's cup also contains BLOOD (17:6). Yet, almost all commentators teach that the blood by which the woman is drunken is the LITERAL blood of the saints. Therefore, if the woman's cup contains blood, and this blood is literal, then it should reasonably follow that the fornications in the same cup are also literal. Since the woman is drunken by blood, the Holy Spirit is defining one of the ABOMINATIONS (plural, 17:5) in the woman's cup to be MURDER (17:6). The Bible plainly calls the murder of the innocent an ABOMINATION to God:

Proverbs 6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an ABOMINATION unto him:
17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and HANDS THAT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD,

This abomination in the cup (i.e. murder) is certainly literal. Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that the fornication in the cup is also literal, and that other abominations (e.g. sodomy, etc.) will also be found in Rome in the last days. Sorcery, thefts, murder and fornication are all literally the major sins of mankind in the last days (Revelation 9:21). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the main, world-dominating, influential city in the Tribulation period will be the promoter of these same LITERAL vices. This is why the Holy Ghost reveals that Rome's cup contains these literal abominations. Rome in its final days will not only be a center of idolatry, a state-church, and false religion, it will be a city that spawns LITERAL FORNICATION and MURDER throughout the world. We have seen this in the past in Pagan Rome and Papal Rome. It will likewise be Rome's destiny in the future. The sodomy and fornication rampant among priests in the present is another sign that the Tribulation age is rapidly approaching. Let us watch and pray!

This bring us to the second point, already noticed somewhat: In spite of the bad publicity the Roman Catholic organization is presently receiving in the press, it is certain that its influence or impact will NOT, ultimately, be diminished. Whatever temporary setbacks it may suffer, it will continue its rise to power until it finally and completely fulfils Revelation 17 in the future, Tribulation period.

While we pray that many individual Catholics will use this time to reconsider the claims of Rome, the majority of people will simply respond to the perversion of priests in the same manner that they responded to the perversions of former president Clinton in the White House. Many will see this perversion as a necessary evil; others will actually welcome it, since it provides a cloak for their OWN perversions and debauchery.

Roman Catholicism, unfortunately, is here to stay - at least until Revelation 17:16. The masses will respond to the modern perversion of priests in the same manner in which they responded to the perversion of earlier priests throughout history. The sexual immorality of Catholic priests is not a new problem. Historically, it has been linked to the celibacy of the Catholic clergy by a number of writers. Sodomy is one of the last depravities into which rebellious man falls before his destruction (see Romans 1, Genesis 19). Therefore, it is true that depraved man will indulge in this sin, with or without the unbiblical doctrine of a celibate clergy. On the other hand, this evil doctrine makes provision for this sin, and helps hasten the damnation of a nation.

An anonymous writer, in 1844, wrote, "Romanism: Incompatible with Republican Institutions (by Civis)." In this work, the writer states:

"The celibacy of the clergy tends still more directly to the destruction of morality. The history of the church abounds with evidence that where the clergy have been confined by their rules of discipline to a life of celibacy, they have been the most industrious promoters of licentiousness. Hear what Claude D'Espence says on this subject, a divine of the Romish church. He complains as follows: 'Shameful to relate they give permission to their priests to have concubines, etc., upon the payment of annual tribute. And in some places they oblige them to pay the tax, saying they may use the privilege if they please.' We forbear to multiply passages of this nature, not because they are rare, but because the recital would be offensive to the reader....Wielding the power of the confessional, the master of the secret actions and thoughts of the females of their communion, they hold in their power the most potent means for their corruption." (p.70).

Alexander Hislop, writing in, "The Two Babylons" argues similarly:

"The records of all nations where priestly celibacy has been introduced have proved that, instead of ministering to the purity of those condemned to it, it has only plunged them in the deepest pollution....The excesses committed by the celibate priests of Bacchus in Pagan Rome in their secret Mysteries, were such that the Senate felt called upon to expel them from the bounds of the Roman republic. In Papal Rome the same abominations have flowed from priestly celibacy, in connection with the corrupt and corrupting system of the confessional....Out of a thousand facts of similar kind, let one only be adduced, vouched for by the distinguished Roman Catholic historian De Thou. When Pope Paul V. meditated the suppression of the licensed brothels in the 'Holy City,' the Roman Senate petitioned against his carrying his design into effect, on the ground that the existence of such places was the only means of HINDERING THE PRIESTS FROM SEDUCING THEIR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS!!" (p.220)

"The Manual of Universal Church History," by Alzog, bears the Imprimatur of the Archbishop of Cincinnati. In this volume, Catholic historian, Alzog states:

"There were eighty councils held in France during the eleventh century, and of these there was not a single one in which a protest of the fathers was not directed against the lawlessness and brigandage of the laity and the unchastity and simony of the clergy....The gradual decline in papal influence and the evil example of the lives of some Popes reacted with terrible effect upon the morals of the bishops....Concubinage was the crying vice among the clergy of many dioceses....The dissoluteness of morals rapidly infected the laity, who learned from those whose lives should have been examples of manly honesty and priestly honor to put a light estimate on the virtue of purity....Some professed to believe that the marriage of the clergy was the only adequate remedy for the evil; but others...maintained that the well-being of the Church depended on the rule of celibacy...."
(Vol. II., p.368, 928-31).

The historical work, "Lives of the Popes," by Catholic writer, Ludwig Pastor, was drawn from the secret archives of the Vatican. The work was praised by the Pope and dedicated to him. Pastor writes:

"But this [prostitution] was not the worst of the maladies which the false renaissance brought upon Italy....There is unmistakable evidence of the revival of the horrible national vice of the Greeks [i.e. sodomy]....It made its way into the lower ranks also....many of the monasteries were in a most deplorable condition. The three essential vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, were in some convents almost entirely disregarded...Sixtus IV found it necessary to direct a Bull against some Carmelites in Bolgna who had maintained that there was no harm in asking for things from demons...."

Pastor also documents the immoral lives of many of the popes. Will Durant, an atheist historian, also quotes Pastor for his history. He documents that it is the tendency of people to accept immorality as normal in the Catholic clergy:

"Alexander VI, like Luther and Calvin, thought clerical celibacy a mistake, and begot five or more children before subsiding into reasonable continence as a pope....a certain amorousness was THEN ACCEPTED AS USUAL in the clergy....Some confessors solicited sexual favors from female penitents. Thousands of priests had concubines; in Germany nearly all. In Rome it was assumed that priests kept concubines; and some reports estimated the prostitutes there at 6,000 in a population not exceeding 100,000. To quote again a Catholic historian [Pastor, "History of the Popes," V, 457]:

'It is not surprising, when the highest ranks of clergy were in such a state, that among the regular orders and secular priests vice and irregularities of all sorts should become more and more common....But it is a mistake to suppose that the corruption of the clergy was worse in Rome than elsewhere; there is documentary evidence of the immorality of the priests in almost every town in the Italian peninsula....Their immorality was so gross that suggestions in favor of allowing priests to marry began to be heard.'

....Bishop Hardouin of Angers reported (1428) that the clergy of his diocese did not count concubinage a sin, and that they made no attempt to disguise their use of it. In Pomerania, about 1500, such unions were RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE AS REASONABLE, and were encouraged by them as protection for their daughters and wives....Wyclif, Langland, Gower, and Chaucer agreed in noting a predilection, among monks and friars, for good food and bad women...."
(Will Durant, "The Reformation," 1957, pp.13)

Again, temporary movements of apparent reformation aside, the final result will be that Rome, through Satanic seduction, will rise in dominion over the entire world. In fact, so many people's minds are so perverted through TV, movies, and the Internet, the publicized actions of these priests will only serve to PROMOTE and SANCTIFY sodomy and sexual child abuse in the minds of many.

Historically, it appears that it was no secret in the minds of political and Roman Catholic leaders, or in the minds of the masses at large, that clerical celibacy contributed to the moral depravity of the priests. In fact, many no doubt sought (and still seek) the priesthood for the purpose of increasing their opportunities for vile perversion. What is the reason that this wicked restriction is left in place? Jeremiah J. Crowley (a well-known, former priest), in 1912, states that Rome uses the corruption to wield power:

"Why this rank, rampant immorality among the Roman Catholic hierarchy? Priestly celibacy and auricular confession, I assert, are chiefly responsible. Priestly celibacy and auricular confession ever have been, and are now, prolific sources of crime and licentiousness. Pope Gregory VII, in the eleventh century, imposed the unnatural law of priestly celibacy, notwithstanding the vehement protests of the priests, the vast majority of whom had wives and legitimate children. This decree, making priestly marriage a wrong and priestly celibacy a virtue, has honey-combed the Roman Catholic Church with corruption. Pope Gregory VII, and his infallible successors, in imposing priestly celibacy, WERE ACTUATED BY POLITICAL rather than virtuous motives. This was generally admitted....In 1907 three thousand French priests signed and sent a petition to Pope Pius, praying for the abolition of priestly celibacy. All of these priests were past the marrying age themselves, but were speaking from the weight of responsibility thrust upon them by confession. This appeal was consigned to the papal wastebasket. Dr. Robert E. Speer, the noted secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Missions, recently wrote:

'The celibacy of the priesthood had seemed to me a monstrous and wicked theory, but I had believed that men who took the vow were true to it....But the deadly evidence spread out all over South America, confronting one in every district to which he goes; evidence legally convincing, morally sickening, proves to him that, whatever may be the case in other lands, in South America the stream of the church is polluted at its fountains.'

Rome is ever and everywhere the same. She prefers priestly celibacy with concubinage to priestly marriage....Among those who have been compelled to flee to escape chastisement, or perhaps death, from outraged husbands, fathers, brothers, or lynching by the community at large, are: The Most Rev. Bertram Orth, lately Archbishop of Victoria, British Columbia. The Right Rev. Thomas F. Brennan, formerly Bishop of Dallas, Texas. The Right Rev. Timothy O'Mahony, late Auxiliary Bishop of Toronto, Canada, formerly of Australia, and Cork, Ireland. The Right Rev. Monsignor Capel, formerly of England. The Right Rev. Monsignor Fowler, formerly of Sioux City, Iowa, and Philippine Islands. Rev. W.R. Thompson, formerly of Portland, Oregon. Rev. Lawrence Erhardt, formerly of Chicago. Rev. F.J. Knipper, formerly of Troy, Ohio. Rev. Levis T. McGinn, formerly of Brooklyn, New York. SOME OF THESE WERE GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF SODOMY - A CRIME, ALAS! TO WHICH MONKS, PRIESTS, PRELATES, AND EVEN POPES, THE 'VICARS OF CHRIST,' ARE NOT STRANGERS. The number of similar offenders is legion, and no wonder! The vast majority of priests, prelates, and other members of the Hierarchy are driven into immorality by priestly celibacy and auricular confession. THIS WHOLESALE DEMORALIZATION WAS ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE MOTIVES FOR INSTITUTING CELIBACY AND AURICULAR CONFESSION. THE RESLUT ACCOMPLISHED IS JUST WHAT THE VATICAN MACHINE WANTED. THIS DEMORALIZATION COMPELS WICKED PRIESTS, PRELATES AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HIERARCHY, OF BOTH SEXES, TO STAND BY EACH OTHER AND FOR THE VATICAN SYSTEM, THEIR AXIOM BEING, 'Standum est pro auctoritate per fas aut nefas' (Stand by authority, right or wrong). IT IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS IS FOUND AMONG CORRUPT POLITICIANS, WHO FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION, ARE COMPELLED TO STAND BY EACH OTHER AND FOR THEIR POLITICAL MACHINE. Rome, thoroughly aware of its diabolical crimes, for its own protection promotes the shrewdest of her demoralized ecclesiastics to the very highest offices...." ("Romanism: A Menace to the Nation")

As with so many other things occurring in the world today, the sodomy among Catholic clergy is a stage-setting sign that the time of the end is upon us. Let us use this opportunity to help Catholics see and admit that Rome is not infallible as she claims, and the only way to be saved in eternity is through faith in the Gospel.

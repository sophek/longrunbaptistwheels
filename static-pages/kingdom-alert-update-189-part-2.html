        <div id="content">
            <P>(CONTINUED):</P><BR>  <P>A RESPONSE TO ROBERT L. SUMNER'S EXTENDED REVIEW OF "THE ROD: WILL GOD SPARE IT?" IN THE NOVEMBER-DECEMBER, 2002 ISSUE OF "THE BIBLICAL EVANGELIST" (PART 1)</P>  <P>SUMNER: "As for whether Romanists teach that Purgatory is 'to become a child of God' as he claims, let me quote one of his own authorities on the subject regarding Rome's position: 'The doctrine of purgatory does not, therefore, involve the idea of the future redemption of the impenitent. 'The souls who go to purgatory are only such as die in the state of grace, united to Jesus Christ. It is their imperfect works for which they are condemned to that place of suffering, which must all be consumed, and their stains purged away from them before they can go to heaven'....That sounds to me exactly what Faust is saying..."</P>  <P>Catholics do not mean by "grace" (i.e. "state of grace") what fundamental Christians mean by the word. They mean that the Catholic has lived a life of good deeds, sacraments and masses. He has earned the right (through God's grace) to go to Purgatory and atone for venial sins through suffering. It is all eternal salvation by grace AND WORKS from start to finish. The Catholic cannot possess absolute assurance of eternal salvation until after death. He must wait and make sure he does not fall out of a state of grace. If he does, he will be eternally damned. Yet, according to my view, a Christian can possess absolute assurance of salvation in eternity, and he does not have to wait his whole life to see if he remains in a "state of grace"(and was not simply a false professor with a false temporary faith). Unconfessed sin will result in chastisement on earth in this life. If God's earthly scourging is despised, or if the Christian faints, and he does not repent before it is too late, he will be in danger of scourging at the Judgment Seat. Yet none of this has anything to do with his salvation assurance, and none of his good works or sufferings (on earth or at the Judgment Seat) have any merit for eternal salvation. </P>  <P>SUMNER: "But who are the overcomers? By comparing Scripture with Scripture we have the answer: 'For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith...' And that is given in a context about believers as obedient commandment keepers (Vss.2,3), but who are called 'overcomers' because they trusted Christ, not because they were obedient to God's commands!..."</P>  <P>Sumner flees from the context of the Book of Revelation to John's 1st Epistle in an attempt to show that "overcomers" does not mean overcoming the temptations of the world and the Devil in the Christian life. In other words, he believes it only refers to a sinner exercising saving faith, and not to a believer exercising victorious faith and patience in the midst of temptations and persecutions. </P>  <P>Each time the "overcoming" promise is given in the Lord's words to the Seven Churches, it includes the following words: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the CHURCHES." John states that he is the "brother" of these Christians in these churches (Revelation 1:9). Why would Jesus be calling them to simply believe the Gospel? They already believe. But let us test Sumner's theory further:</P>  <P>Revelation 2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. </P>  <P>11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that OVERCOMETH shall not be hurt of the second death. </P>  <P>Does "overcometh" sound like it refers to a sinner believing the Gospel in this passage? Is the devil casting unbelievers into prison? Are unbelievers called to be faithful until death? </P>  <P>Notice again:</P>  <P>Revelation 2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. </P>  <P>25 But that which ye have already HOLD FAST till I come. <BR>26 And he that OVERCOMETH, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: <BR>27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. </P>  <P>Does this sound like it refers to a sinner believing the Gospel for the first time? Or does it sound like believers in a church being exhorted to overcome the devil's fiery darts and endure to the end in holiness so they may reign with Christ in the Millennium?</P>  <P>Notice again:</P>  <P>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. </P>  <P>22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. </P>  <P>Do all believers get to sit with Jesus in His throne during the Millennium? If "overcometh" only refers to a sinner believing the Gospel, then it would follow that all believers will get to reign with Jesus simply because they have believed. But what saith the Scriptures?:</P>  <P>2 Timothy 2:12 IF we SUFFER, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</P>  <P>Christians who will not suffer against sin, the world and the devil for Jesus have no promise of reigning with Jesus in the Millennium. </P>  <P>Sumner makes many assumptions. He assumes that the 1st Epistle of John is using the word "overcometh" to refer to a sinner getting saved (and not to a believer overcoming the temptations of the world by a life of faith). </P>  <P>SUMNER: "We find it interesting that he introduced his chapter 'Trial By Fire' with a quote from Ambrose..."</P>  <P>It is not "strange" at all when a person reads the whole chapter. The last part of the same chapter begins with the following words:</P>  <P>"As with all the other truths Rome corrupted, the error of Purgatory is found growing out of a true doctrine the Lord gave to early Christians. The concept of Purgatory is therefore a perversion of truth instead of a whole new creation....During the process of writing this book, the writer decided to read through the writings of Sub-Apostolic Christians. He was amazed at how prevalent the teaching of 'trial by fire' was among these early writers. The writings of these so-called, early 'Church Fathers' are certainly not inspired. They contain errors. Nevertheless, with this Biblical understanding of a second death for some Christians at the judgment seat, many of the writings of these early Christians are made easier to comprehend. Even though much error was already creeping in, ushering in the infamous dark ages, it appears that many early Christians preserved seeds of truth (at least in regard to the Christianâ€™s future judgment and the millennial reign) that were taught by the holy apostles of the first century. Notice the following words [quotes]."</P>  <P>Sumner apparently wishes to leave his readers with the impression that I approve of all that Ambrose teaches. But any man who actually reads the chapter can plainly see why I quoted these early Christians. </P>  <P>SUMNER: "A 'literal fire'? Says who? If the fire is literal all the sense goes out of that Bema Seat passage in 1 Corinthians 3. It [sic] the fire is literal, so are the 'wood, hay and stubble'....if they are figurative, by the very basics of hermeneutics, so is the fire...."</P>  <P>Sumner does not refute the arguments I provided to support my conclusions. I will list some of them here. I spend a considerable amount of time proving that the chief JUDGMENT in parables and figures throughout Scripture (whether to unbelievers or disciples) is LITERAL, in spite of the illustrations which surround it: </P>  <P>Matthew 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to BURN them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</P>  <P>37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and BURNED in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE...</P>  <P>Now let us remind ourselves of Sumner's words, which he stated so authoritatively, as if any true "scholar" is supposed to understand such things: "It [sic] the fire is literal, so are the 'wood, hay and stubble'....if they are figurative, by the very basics of hermeneutics, so is the fire.." Well then, does Sumner hold that unbelievers will meet with a FIGURATIVE BURNING? The "wheat" and "tares" are figurative. The "seed" is figurative. I suppose that means that the BURNING is figurative as well? Sumner is convinced that the "fire" in 1 Corinthians 3 is the "holiness of God." It think it is God Himself, the consuming fire, whose very breath ignites Tophet (Isaiah 30:33). But Sumner implies that the fire of God's holiness does not literally burn anyone. He writes, "There is all the terror we need: facing God's holiness with our puny works..." Sumner is now teaching a CATHOLIC PURGATORY with his Catholic view of assurance. Notice what modern Catholics now believe:</P>  <P>"My question concerns purgatory, which we hardly ever hear about any more....[Answer:] The hoary pictures of torture, pain, and a scourging God - which made of purgatory a kind of mini-hell - may literally scare the devil out of someone, but they're totally irrelevant to the doctrine of purgatory. These gory images grew up around the idea of purgatory through the Middle Ages....It is very possible that, in the burst of awareness of the reality of God and creation that might occur immediately after death, the pain that comes from the KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SINS and shortcomings might be so acute and intense that an entire purgatory - or cleansing, which is what the word purgatory means - could occur in an instant....The church hasn't attempted officially to satisfy our curiosity about such questions - and probably couldn't if it tried." (John J. Dietzen, "The New Question Box," 1988)</P>  <P>Since Rome has never officially defined Purgatory in detail, and since Catholics are now removing LITERAL and physical pain from the doctrine, Sumner is teaching something closer to modern Rome's Purgatory than I am! "There is all the terror we need: facing God's holiness with our puny works..." This is the accountability teaching of modern liberals and Catholics. Is this all the terror the unbeliever needs? If we are to follow Sumner's "basics of hermeneutics," we must conclude that the BURNING in the PARABLE of the Wheat and the Tares is ONLY figurative since if the wheat and the tares are figurative, so is the burning. This is his logic. But what saith the Lord? He states that the children of the devil will be burned in a LITERAL furnace of fire. Paul, as Jesus in Matthew 13, sums up his picture by showing that in spite of the illustrations, the JUDGMENT in the passage is literal:</P>  <P>1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as BY FIRE. 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 17 If any man defile the temple of God, HIM shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye </P>  <P>It is the carnal believer himself in verse 17 that is destroyed. He will be saved at last; yet so as by FIRE. Paul speaks of literal fire on other occasions:</P><BR>  <P>Hebrews 10:26 For if WE sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, </P><BR>  <P>27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and FIERY indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. </P><BR>  <P>Hebrews 12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not WE escape, if WE turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</P><BR>  <P>29 For our God is a consuming FIRE.</P><BR>  <P>All of these arguments are developed in detail in my 460 page book on the subject.</P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "Faust makes much of the passage in II Corinthians 5: 9-11...highlighting especially the phrase 'the terror of the Lord.'....The answer is simple. Without going into any great detail, here is one biblical illustration: Acts 9:31, "Then had the churches rest...and were edified; walking in the fear of the Lord...' The Greek there is the same as in II Corinthians 5:11. In one case it is the reaction at the Bema Seat, in the other (where there is certainly NO suggestion of ANY KIND of death), it is the reaction of Christians who are walking in the Spirit. So much for 'temporary death after death' for believers."</P><BR>  <P>The word can mean fear or terror depending upon its context and usage. The Translators translated it as TERROR in 2 Corinthians 5:11. It is the same word in Acts 5:</P>  <P>Acts 5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great FEAR came on all them that heard these things. 10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. 11 And great FEAR came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. </P><BR>  <P>The Christians in Acts 9 are walking in the FEAR of God, the very fear they began to learn about in Acts 5. Sumner implies that the Christians in Acts 9 had no fear at all that God could kill them if they chose to lie to the Holy Ghost! But this is illogical. These Christians knew the goodness and the severity of God. If God would kill a couple for lying in the church in this day of grace, what would He do to unrepentant Christians on the day of judgment? Paul said, "knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." In the Bible, the true fear of God is something that brings literal TREMBLING and QUAKING (Phil.2:12, Hebrews 12:21). We know enough of what God can do and will do, according to His Word, to move us to persuade men to fear God and walk in obedience. 2 Corinthians 5:9-11 reveals that the same judgments we have seen fall upon Ananias and Sapphira (or worse) may befall carnal believers at the Judgment Seat!! </P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "It was regarding this verse [2 Corinthians 5:11] that he quoted John R. Rice, who didn't believe for a minute what Faust is teaching....Faust speaks of 'loss' as punishment, but that is NOT how Rice uses the term..."</P><BR>  <P>One is almost tempted to think that brother Sumner is simply thumbing through the index of my book and looking for things to comment upon. Notice the passage out of my chapter and compare it to Sumner's claims above:</P><BR>  <P>"There have been many Christian leaders that have properly applied this warning [ 2 Corinthians 5:9-11] to Christians; yet all too often, there has been a tendency in some teachers to water down the word terror or attempt to thrust it into obscurity:</P><BR>  <P>'â€¦to face Christ at that time will be a terror to those who have failed to do His bidding after they were saved. I say 'terror' - that is exactly what Paul wrote of that time by inspiration of Godâ€¦I once thought that verse was speaking of the terror with which lost men will face Christ, but it is not soâ€¦In Heaven it will be terrible to face Christ who saved you and keeps you, in your shame over your wasted life!â€¦I am not speaking of punishment now, but of tears, of shame and sadness.' -John R. Rice (1895-1980) </P><BR>  <P>Christian leaders that apply such warnings to believers should be commended. Yet, many fall short of correctly elucidating the warnings with other Scriptures. The Bible abounds with additional information on this subject. Paul uses the word terror to describe the power of the government to inflict death by the sword (Romans 13:3-4). Certainly, the Corinthians knew what Paul meant by the 'terror of the Lord'; he had warned them about it several times in his first Epistle to them..." [End of excerpt]</P><BR>  <P>As can be seen by the a basic, left to right read of my book, John R. Rice is quoted in the context of people who did NOT embrace my view, but nevertheless, rightly applied the terror of the Lord to Christians. </P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "He quotes Dr. George W. Dollar repeatedly as one on his side, but, as I write this, Dollar has just denied to a long time friend that he holds Faust's position."</P><BR>  <P>I just got off the phone with Dr. Dollar and he said he doesn't know what Sumner is talking about! He said he hasn't discussed my book with anyone. I quote brother Dollar as an historian and as a believer in outer darkness for carnal believers during the Millennium. So brother Sumner's is as off-target on this as he was on claiming brother Bill Jackson was a Catholic priest, and the other quotes he took out of context in my book.</P><BR>  <P>In spite of my obvious disagreements with brother Sumner, his review is the most detailed and lengthy critique to date. I am thankful that he took the time. I pray that the Holy Spirit will convict him through His Word to at least begin to move closer to my position. Modern fundamentalism needs it. </P><BR>  <P>=======================================</P><BR>  <P>http://www.kingdombaptist.org</P><BR>  <P>817 453-5542</P>

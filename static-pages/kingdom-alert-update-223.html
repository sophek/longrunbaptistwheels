            THE SLAVERY ARGUMENT: MARCHING TO HELL UNDER THE BANNER OF EQUAL RIGHTS

I spent most of my childhood in South Carolina (I am 37 years old). I
vividly remember awaking one night to a cross burning in the yard across
from our house. A black couple had moved into our neighborhood. I grew up
among T-shirts with Confederate flags, and concerts which proclaimed, "The
South shall rise again!" Politically, I believe in the rights of states as
intended by the framers of our Constitution, and I think that the
Republicans and Democrats are BOTH guilty of attempting to produce and
feed a mammoth, Socialist, welfare-state. I have the South in my bones.
Yet, I will NOT defend the unlawful system of slavery advocated by some of
the 19th century, Baptist preachers in the Southern states. Perhaps, in
God's mercy, if more Baptists had stood against slavery, it is very
possible that the Civil War (which pitted two moral doctrines against each
another: the rights of states, and the rights of blacks, as humans) might
never have occurred. But the status of Baptists had improved considerably
in the 19th century. They went from having almost no churches in the South
in the 18th century, to becoming the largest denomination in America at
the start of the 19th century. The political founders of our country were
influenced by the writings of the Baptists. After the Revolution, it was
therefore no longer "uncouth" to be a Baptist. Many rich, Southern
plantation owners, for the first time, flocked to Baptist churches. When
Baptist pastors in the South (at the start of the 19th century) looked out
from their pulpits and beheld their congregations, they saw as many church
members who owned COLORED SLAVES, as Baptist preachers today see church
members who own COLOR TV'S (hooked up to HBO)! And it would have been as
unpopular then to preach that church members should give up their slaves,
as it would be to preach that church members, today, should disconnect
worldly programming on their TV's (i.e. 1 Corinthians 15:33, Psalms 101:3,
Psalms 119:63). Perhaps a better example would be the Biblical doctrine
that mothers should be "keepers at home" (Titus 2:5, 1 Timothy 5:14,
Psalms 68:12, 113:9, Proverbs 7:11, 14:1). As with slavery, the income and
standard of living of those who obey this command is (in some ways)
diminished. Therefore, as with slavery, many modern preachers remain
silent and refuse to "upset" what has become a cultural norm (i.e. the
two-income family with children on Ritalin, raised by daycares and public
schools). The parallel is even more pronounced when we remember that
Booker T. Washington ("Up From Slavery") described how many Southern women
had long forgotten how to perform domestic chores! Such work was seen as
something "undignified." It was "for the slaves." The South had lost the
Biblical work ethic (1 Corinthians 4:12, Ephesians 4:28, 1 Thessalonians
2:9, 2 Thessalonians 3:8). The plain truth is that a great number of
"important" (i.e. rich) people would have LEFT the Baptist churches if
slavery had been reproved by the Baptist preachers (just like many
churches today would lose more than half their membership if Titus 2 was
even READ from the pulpit without thirty minutes of "watering down" the
verses with unbiblical DISCLAIMERS). At least one-third of Baptist
membership in the South Carolina churches were slave-holders. With the
"sprinkling" Methodists gaining ground on every corner, and Baptists, for
the first time in history, finally possessing the freedom to evangelize
and build their churches without persecution, it was obviously very
tempting for Baptist preachers in the South to wash their hands like
Pilate, and blame the African's plight on Ham (i.e. Noah's son, not pork).
Evangelism and church building have always been used to excuse many sins
and unholy prejudices in God's people. We should therefore learn from past
mistakes. We should STRIVE to win souls and build churches; but we must
remember that we must strive LAWFULLY (2 Timothy 2:5). The old words of
Martin Luther are ever true:

"If I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion
of the truth of God except precisely that little point that the world and
the devil are at the moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ, however
boldly I may be professing Christ. Where the battle rages is where the
loyalty of the soldier is proved, and to be steady on all the battlefield
besides is merely flight and disgrace if he flinches at that point."

Compromising preachers often fail to take a stand for certain truths. How
easy it is to justify sin (or be silent) when the entire culture embraces
it (i.e. "You don't have a TV, or watch worldly movies? What do you do
with your time, and how do you stay informed?"; "You don't have slaves?
How do you wash clothes and feed the animals?"). We can and should learn
from the sins of our forefathers. But the main purpose of this article is
to set the record straight, historically. When modern, fundamental
Christians preach against homosexuality, feminism, humanism, etc., they
are often met with the following objection, I recently read:

"Say, aren't these the same people that fought for slavery? Where were
their morals then?"

Indeed, the injustices of "men-stealing" (1 Timothy 1:10, Genesis 37:27,
40:15, Exodus 21:16), and the unlawful form of slavery advocated by some
Christians in history, are often used to prove that "Christian culture" is
wrong in every other area where modern people desire liberty. However, it
should be obvious to everyone that every desired liberty is not holy or
godly. And even those who foolishly advocate immorality will usually draw
the line somewhere. Those who use American slavery to justify ignoring
Biblical, traditional morality in regard to the family, should remember
that America abolished the SLAVE TRADE in 1808, due to CHRISTIAN
INFLUENCES! Britain had abolished the slave trade in 1807; they abolished
slavery in their empire in 1833. John Newton (1725-1807) was the writer of
the famous hymn, "Amazing Grace." Before his conversion, he was a brutal,
immoral slave trader, and the captain of a slave ship. After he repented,
he published the book, "Thoughts on the African Slave Trade," which was
based on his own experiences as a wretched sinner. This book helped
influence the abolition of slavery in Britain. William Wilberforce
(1759-1833) was inspired by the testimony of John Newton, and he looked to
him for spiritual guidance. Under the anti-slavery influences of Newton
and John Wesley, Wilberforce (though only five feet tall) became the
tallest leader in the crusade that would, in the end, abolish slavery in
Britain. He delivered his first anti-slavery motion to the floor of the
House of Commons in 1789. He would live to see his labors rewarded in
England.

Therefore, CHRISTIANITY abolished slavery in Britain (and the slave trade
in America) BEFORE evolution, public education, and Hollywood (the things
many foolish people think are "progress"). Many modern people also forget
that the early, evolutionary scientists (the supposed "enlightened" ones)
carried their dogma to its logical conclusion, and proclaimed that the
different races should also be arranged on an evolutionary totem pole.
They concluded that the darker the skin, the closer a person is to the
apes! The REAL title of Darwin's infamous book was, "The Origin of the
Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of FAVORED
RACES in the Struggle for Life" (1859). In "The Descent of Man," Darwin
wrote:

"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the
civilized races of man will almost certainly EXTERMINATE AND REPLACE THE
SAVAGE RACES throughout the world....The break between man and his nearest
allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more
civilized state, as we may hope, even than the CAUCASIAN, and some ape as
low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro [sic] or Australian
and the gorilla."

T. H. Huxley, Darwin's disciple, stated:

"...no rational man, cognizant of the facts, believes that the average
negro [sic] is the equal, still less the superior, of the average white
man....The highest places in the hierarchy of civilization will assuredly
not be within the reach of our dusky cousins...."

Christ-hating philosophers like Nietzsche developed this evolutionary
dogma into a "tight" package so Hitler could later use it to butcher
millions of so-called "inferior races."

And not only were the "enlightened" scientists and philosophers no
practical friend to slaves, but the "liberal" churches (Southern
Unitarians, Universalists, etc.) did NOT oppose American slavery. In
Southern cities, slave ownership was a symbol of prestige. Unitarianism
(since it rejects the fundamental Bible doctrines) often appealed to the
rich and worldly educated (1 Corinthians 1:18-21). And these were, of
course, the first to own slaves as a status symbol.

After the abolition of the slave trade, many of the Christian
disagreements concerning slavery hinged upon how to deal with the slaves
already on American soil. Many Christian and political leaders had long
advocated a gradual process of abolition. Pioneer BAPTIST preacher, David
Barrow (1753-1819), took a strong stand against slavery. Some letters he
received from Thomas Jefferson reveal the popularity of the gradual view
of abolition:

"Both parties require long and difficult preparation....that of the slave
is to be prepared by instruction and habit for self-government, and for
the honest pursuits of industry and social duty. Both of these courses of
preparation require time, and the former must precede the latter." (Thomas
Jefferson to David Barrow, 1815)

"The particular subject of the pamphlet [against slavery] you enclosed me
was one of early and tender consideration with me, and had I continued in
the councils of my own State, it should never have been out of sight. The
only practicable plan I could ever devise is stated under the 14th Query
of my Notes on Virginia, and it is still the one most sound in my
judgment....Where the disease is most deeply seated, there it will be
slowest in eradication. In the Northern States it was merely superficial
and easily corrected. In the Southern, it is incorporated with the whole
system and requires time, patience, and perseverance in the curative
process. That it may finally be effected and its progress hastened, will
be [my] last and fondest prayer." (Thomas Jefferson to David Barrow, 1815)

Before stereotyping the early Baptists as "bigoted slave owners," modern
liberals and defenders of perversion, should remember that THE BAPTISTS
were VERY instrumental in establishing religious liberty in America:

"Freedom of conscience, unlimited freedom of mind, was from the first the
trophy of the Baptists." (George Bancroft, "History of the United States,"
1840)

"The Baptists were the first propounders of absolute liberty, just and
true liberty, equal and impartial liberty." (John Locke)

This history is largely forgotten today. It is not "politically correct"
to remember it. It does not fit the "agenda" of liberals, homosexuals,
feminists, etc., who wish to paint modern, fundamental Baptists as the
philosophical descendants of wife-beating, slave-whipping, Bible-thumpers
in the 19th century. What is even lesser known (or admitted) today, is the
extent that early Baptists reproved slavery. It is true, as we have
already noted, that when Baptists were no longer persecuted after the
Revolution, and they became the largest denomination in the South (if not
in America), and many rich plantation owners (for the first time in
history) became members of their churches, that some in the South
increasingly embraced and defended slavery. However, this fails to realize
how many Southern Baptists LEFT THE SOUTH over the issue. And it fails to
realize the extent that Baptists reproved slavery, especially before the
Revolution, when they were persecuted street preachers, often deemed to be
"fanatics" by the established ministers (e.g. between 1768-1777, at least
30 Baptist preachers were whipped or imprisoned).

EARLY BAPTISTS AGAINST SLAVERY

Most people have read of the fiery preaching of Wesley and Finney against
slavery. Yet, many are not aware of the extent that BAPTISTS also reproved
the sin.

In 1652, Rhode Island passed the first law in North America against
slavery. BAPTIST preacher, John Clark (who founded the FIRST Baptist
church on America soil), received a Royal Charter for Rhode Island in
1663.

It has been said that no individual since Roger Williams ("Baptistic"
preacher) is better known as a champion of religious liberty than Isaac
Backus (1704-1806). For his work and energy, he has also been called the
"father of American Baptists." He was the most influential Baptist leader
in Colonial America. In 1785, he wrote, "Godliness excludes slavery, in
Answer to John Cleaveland." In 1805, a year before his death, he wrote the
following words:
 
"The liberty that he [Roger Williams] was for, civil and religious, is now
enjoyed in thirteen of the seventeen of the United States of America. No
tax for any religious minister is imposed by authority in any of the said
13 states, and their power is weakened in the other 4. SLAVERY is also
abolished in the northern states and it is wearing away in the rest..."
(Letter to Elder William Richards, April 20th, 1805)

Backus preached in the homes of blacks. In 1773, Backus received a letter
from a fellow Baptist in condemnation of slavery, which he then read to
his church:

"I take liberty to offer to your consideration one thing that I verily
believe ought to be razed out of the church of Christ: and that is the
making slaves of the poor Negroes....Though I know of but few in our
[Baptist] churches that have Negro slaves, yet the thing is allowed and
not witnessed against as I think it ought to be...That it appears to me
high time for the watchmen to sound an alarm against this practice, and
for churches to purge themselves from these..." (Ebenzer Smith to Isaac
Backus, 1773)

The following year, Backus praised the Continental Congress for their
concern over slavery.

On one occasion Backus wrote: 

"No man abhors that wicked practice [of slavery] more than I do, and would
gladly make use of lawful means towards the abolishing of slavery in all
parts of the land. But let us consider where we are, and what we are
doing. In the Articles of Confederation no provision was made to hinder
the importation of slaves into any of these states; but a door is now open
hereafter to do it, and each state is at liberty now to abolish slavery as
soon as they please....Slavery grows more odious through the world; and as
an honorable gentleman said some days ago, 'Though we cannot say that
slavery is struck with an apolexy, yet we may hope it will die with
consumption."

In 1787, the Warren (Baptist) Association (Rhode Island), after referring
to the slave trade as "menstealing," stated:

"We therefore earnestly desire all our brethren to guard against giving
the least countenance to this Heaven daring wickedness."

In 1787, the Kentockian Association (Virginia) stated:

"...hereditary slavery was a breach of the divine law."

It appointed a committee to form a plan for "gradual emancipation."

In 1789, the Philadelphia Baptist Association (urged by the First Baptist
Church of Baltimore) praised existing abolition societies, and recommended
that its churches form similar societies:

"...this Association declares their high approbation of the several
societies formed in the United States and Europe, for the gradual
abolition of the slavery of the Africans....and do hereby recommend to the
churches we represent to form similar societies to become members thereof
and exert themselves to obtain this important object."

John Leland (1754-1841) was a friend to Thomas Jefferson and James
Madison. Against the evils of slavery, he wrote:

"The whole scene of slavery is pregnant with enormous evils....why not
liberate them at once? Would to Heaven this were done! The sweets of rural
and social life will never be well enjoyed, until it is the case."

In 1790, he proposed a resolution adopted by the Baptist General Committee
of Virginia. It read:

"Resolved, That slavery is a violent deprivation of the rights of nature
and inconsistent with a republican government, and therefore recommend it
to our brethren to use every legal measure to extirpate this horrid evil
from the land; and pray Almighty God that our honorable Legislature may
have it in their power to proclaim the great Jubilee consistent with the
principles of good policy."

In 1792 the General Committee passed another, softer resolution declaring
that the issue of slavery belonged to the legislative body.

John Asplund (1755-1807), an early chronicler of Baptist history, in 1791,
wrote against, "keeping our fellow creatures in bondage, who had as good a
right as we, both to civil and religious liberty."

In 1792, the Shaftesbury Baptist Association (Vermont) stated:

"That this association being impressed with a sense of that freedom which
every child of Adam is entitled to by nature, and which they cannot be
deprived but by hostile usurpation, take this method of manifesting their
hearty detestation of the slave trade, and recommend it to our brethren to
pray Almighty God, to hasten the auspicious day when the Ethiopian with
all the human race shall enjoy the liberty due to every good citizen of
the commonwealth, and the name of slave be extirpated from the earth."

John Clark (d.1833) was a Baptist preacher who moved to Illinois, where he
joined, "The Baptized Church of Christ, Friends of Humanity," and became
active in the anti-slavery movement.

In 1797, the Dover Baptist Association (Virginia) stated:

"We sincerely sympathize, both as Christians and citizens, with these
unhappy people [black slaves], and although we think it a delicate matter,
we would not wish to be backward in promoting their happiness and liberty,
upon cautious ground. We would, therefore, recommend to our Brethren to
unite with the Abolition Societies in proposing a petition to the General
Assembly for their gradual emancipation upon some rational and benevolent
plan."

In 1807, the Elkhorn Baptist Association (Kentucky) divided over slavery,
and Baptist preachers David Barrow and Carter Tarrant, led in the
formation of the "Baptized Licking Locust Association, Friends of
Humanity," which was dedicated to preaching against slavery.

In 1807, the Miami Baptist Association, in regard to its churches, urged
that, "caution be used in admitting among them those who held the
sentiment and practice of hereditary slavery."
 
In 1808, the New York Baptist Association stated:

"In the opinion of this association the practice of slaveholding ought to
be discountenanced as much as possible."

In 1815, the Sandy Creek Baptist Association (North Carolina) condemned
the buying and selling of slaves for profit.

In 1818, the Chowan Baptist Association (North Carolina) condemned the
buying and selling of slaves for profit.

In 1815, the Cumberland River Baptist Association (Kentucky) stated:

"We conceive that all nations, by nature, have a right to equal
freedom....We think it would be best to wait for the dispensations of
Providence, and pray to God for the happy year of their [the black slaves]
deliverance to commence."

In 1835, English Baptists James Hoby and Francis Cox sailed to America to
admonish American Baptists to abolish slavery.

In 1835, the Sandy Creek Association (North Carolina) again stood against
the "selling and buying of slaves."

By 1835, two-thirds of the delegates to the meeting of the Anti-Slavery
Society (in New England) were BAPTIST and Methodist preachers.

In the North, opposition to slavery grew increasingly fervent. Northern
Baptist fellowships began to forbid its members to have any fellowship
with slaveholders. In 1836, the Hancock Baptist Association (Maine) called
for immediate emancipation.

In 1837, popular Baptist preacher, William Henry Brisbane, left South
Carolina due to his stand against slavery. (Meanwhile, Alexander Campbell,
the "Church of Christ" preacher, was stayed busy writing tracts and
articles in defense of slavery).

In 1839, Freewill Baptists stated:

"Resolved, That it is with sorrow of heart that we learn that slavery is
tolerated, practiced, and defended in certain portions of the Christian
church."

South Carolina and North Carolina Baptists allowed blacks to become
members of their churches, and they tried to greatly improve the condition
of slaves. Yet, in the face of fierce opposition, they felt compelled to
DEFEND the institution of slavery against the "meddling Northern
abolitionists."

In 1840, the American Baptist Anti-Slavery Convention met in New York and
caused great agitation. By 1845, American Baptists finally split over
slavery, and the Southern Baptist Convention was born. But it would be
wrong to claim that every Baptist preacher in the Deep South supported
slavery. Many Baptists left the South over the issue. For example, J. M.
Pendleton (1811-1891), while a Baptist preacher in Kentucky in the late
1830's, wrote many articles against slavery under the heading, "A Southern
Emancipationist" (published in, "The Examiner"). He once wrote (and
practically prophesied):

"My spirit sank within me and I saw no hope for the African race in
Kentucky or anywhere else without the interposition of some providential
judgment."

Pendleton was a friend of the great revival preacher, J. R. Graves.
Pendleton authored the popular, Baptist pamphlet, "An Old Landmark Reset."
In 1857, he became a joint-editor of, "The Tennessee Baptist" with Graves.
It had the widest circulation of all the Baptist papers (in the world) of
the day. He was also an editor of, "The Southern Baptist Review." While
living in Tennessee, Pendleton was unwilling to look at the Confederate
flag. His convictions finally caused him to leave the South in 1862. His
son fought for the South and was killed.

In England, Baptist preachers like Charles Spurgeon, often rebuked the sin
of America slavery:
 
"...we do not so intensely hate slavery as we should do if we saw it
before our eyes: then would the blood boil, when we saw our black brother,
smitten by the cow-hide whip. Imagine a slaveholder standing here and
smiting his poor slave until the red blood gushed forth in a river; can
you conceive your indignation? Now it is distance which makes you feel
this less acutely." (January 23rd, 1859)

Yet, in America, intense debate stirred for decades. Soon, the nation was
ultimately divided in horrible bloodshed. The destructive consequences of
slavery have only begun to be experienced by our nation. Today, every
perverse group imaginable uses the slavery issue to attempt to disqualify
fundamentalist, literal interpretation of the Scriptures, and Christian
preaching against its sins.

THE ATTEMPT TO LINK 19TH-CENTURY SLAVE OWNERSHIP WITH ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY

When good Christians sin (knowingly or unknowingly), the Word of God is
blasphemed, and much evil is then justified by the world. The fact that
many Christians in the South defended slavery is supposed to prove that
modern, fundamental Christians are "blind" like some of their forefathers.
In other words (as many argue today), since some of the Christian
forefathers used the Bible to justify men-stealing and slavery, modern
Christians, likewise, wrongly use the Bible to condemn homosexuality (or
so the argument goes). This argument has first fueled the evils of
feminism (which has practically destroyed the institution of the family in
society, and millions of unborn babies). Homosexuality has attempted to
follow hot upon the heels of feminism, seeking to enter in by the same
door. Other antichrist "rights" movements are not far behind these
movements. Unless the Lord checks this rapid decay of society with a
temporary revival of Biblical morality - pedophilia, bestiality and
cannibalism (and who knows what else) will also seek acceptance under the
banner of "progressive enlightenment."

Notice a recent e-mail (among hundreds) I have received from the
homosexual community:

"Dear Gay protest group, I guess you have placed yourself above others in
a god-like manner and in front of the eyes of god. All I expected was a
simple answer to my last e-mail, and you would not even do that. I still
await a response to that e-mail, and now this one. Now you claim victory
over the ballpark and now Six Flags. Think about what you are doing to our
already depressed economy. Your actions are going to put hundreds of
people out of jobs because you are trying to drive away the public from
these businesses that know how to accept change, unlike you. Despite your
efforts, you are not going to be able to stop the fact that the gay
culture will continue to strive and grow. This is the dawn of the new
Millennium, and with that, the abolishment of the segregation, one culture
at a time. FIRST IT WAS AGAINST WOMEN, THEN AFRICAN-AMERICANS, NOW
HOMOSEXUALS. Your little protest is doing nothing more than hindering the
path of evolution. You need to learn to accept the culture for what it is,
and not for what it isn't. The only reason why you think it's an
abomination is because it is something that you are afraid of. The truth
of the matter lays in you upbringings. As I mentioned in my previous
letter, your hatred towards gays stems from your learned hatred against
African-Americans, and all other forms of Hatred. People fear the unknown,
and Hatred stems from fear. Therefore people accustom themselves to hate
the things they have never had the opportunity to experience..." Sincere
Regards, A Local Homosexual." (Michael Robinson)

He is, no doubt, referring to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's,
when business owners were forced by law to service and hire people of a
different color. The homosexuals (and the pedophiles after them) plan to
RIDE THE SAME WAVE, using the same argument of "equal rights." It all
began when Baptist leaders argued for equal rights before and directly
after the American Revolution. Did these God-given rights apply also to
the slaves? This was a holy question raised by fundamental CHRISTIANS. But
soon, women were using the argument to seek the right to vote, leave the
home and become the breadwinner, with equal pay as men, and preach in
churches. Today, homosexuals are using the argument that has worked so
well for the feminists. And anyone who tells them they are greatly
deceived, is likened unto rich, concubine-raping, tobacco-smoking,
Scripture-quoting slave-masters in the South who had slaves horsewhipped
if they dared to preach the Bible to other slaves. This is the AGENDA of
the homosexuals, as the following news report demonstrates:

"'Bible as hate speech' bill passes - Sponsor: 'It's been a good week for
equality in Canada' - Canada's House of Commons passed a controversial
bill yesterday opposed by religious believers and free-speech advocates
who say it will criminalize public expression against homosexual
behavior....'It's been a good week for equality in Canada,' said the
bill's sponsor, Svend Robinson, an openly homosexual member of
Parliament....Some members of Parliament called it a 'dangerous' law that
muzzles free speech, including Liberal Party member John McKay, who dubbed
it a 'chill bill.' 'Anybody who has views on homosexuality that differ
from Svend Robinson's will be exposed rather dramatically to the joys of
the Criminal Code,' he said, according to the Edmonton Sun. Rushfeldt
contends one of the law's dangers is the term 'sexual orientation' is not
defined. He noted the American Psychiatric Association lists 24 behaviors
under 'sexual orientation.' They include polygamy, bestiality and
pedophilia...." (WND, Sept. 18, 2003)

Therefore, we can expect the argument to be tirelessly repeated.
Homosexuality (and all other perversions) are planning on riding the same
EVOLUTION TRAIN that supposedly liberated blacks and women. However, there
is a big difference. The liberty of blacks in America (like the liberty of
religion) was due (at least foundationally) to CHRISTIAN principles. The
same may be said for the godly protections in society for women and
children, which were contended for by Christians. But much of the
so-called "liberty" of women has been due to INFIDEL principles (e.g. see,
"The Women's Bible" by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the infidel mother of
feminism). And it has wrecked our nation, destroyed families, and has
served as the primary foundation for the "sexual revolution" (which served
as the foundation for the "homosexual revolution"). The so-called
"liberty" of homosexuals, pedophiles, and all other abominable perverts
(which all define "liberty" to mean that no one else is at LIBERTY to say
that these lifestyles are wrong, or to protect their children from them!)
is, and will increasingly be, due to SATANIC principles.

Frederick Douglas once told a group of Bible-hating feminists that their
day of liberation would come, but that they must first wait for the black
man to be liberated. The modern homosexual is quick to simply add his
perverted group to a list of sinners waiting in line for "liberation,"
using the liberty of the black race and the feminists as earlier examples
of "progress" against old-fashioned, Christian bigotry.

Many Christians in the South believed that slavery should one day be
abolished, but not at the expense of what they viewed as despotism. Others
believed that since the Bible commands "servants" to be obedient to
masters, that this justified the American system of slavery. Many of these
Christians would also profess to be fighting against despotism. A letter
to, "The Tennessee Baptist," in 1861, reads:

"I am proud that my native State, 'Old Tennessee,' has taken so noble a
stand in defense of Southern rights. I am sorry though that she contains
any traitors, any sympathizers of the Lincoln DESPOTISM."

The same year, the magazine also received letters from slaves voicing
their support for the "cause" of the South. (See also, Jodie Gilmore,
"Acknowledging Black Confederates...Many black Americans supported the
Southern cause,"
http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2003/09-22-2003/vo19no19_confederates.htm)

After the Civil War, J. R. Graves (editor of "The Tennessee Baptist" for
forty-five years), revealed what was in the heart of many of the preachers
who defended the South:

"...it was the inalienable right of thirteen states and ten millions of
freemen to rule themselves, and no treason to assert it....I am not
ashamed of what I have done...The recent hopes of the South are forever
annihilated: to renew them would be preposterously absurd. The government,
even as it now is, is the best and freest that earth can boast; and let us
as brothers and fellow citizens, pray God to make it all that a pure
government can be in greatness and glory....By our political differences
we rent the mightiest nation; shall we now allow Satan, through us, to
rend the body of Christ by our political grudges and divisions?...From
this day forward let it be said, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
shall be called the children of God.'...There is [however] no hope for the
nation while Satan reigns."
("Satan Dethroned," preached in Memphis, Tenn., soon after the evacuation
of the city by the Federal troops)

It must therefore be admitted that slavery and state's rights were causes
of the Civil War, and that much confusion reigned. Such a horrible
calamity upon a nation, and division among families, certainly makes a
good case for the Civil War (regardless of earthly causes) being seen as
the "providential judgment" that Pendleton viewed as the only hope to end
the sin of slavery in America. What then, may we ask, will God use to end
ABORTION?

THE CIVIL WAR: A DIVINE JUDGMENT?

"I tremble for my country, when I remember that God is just."
(Thomas Jefferson, on the American system of slavery)

The system of slavery in America was a great evil. And it could be argued
that the horrible Civil War (regardless of earthly causes) was a Divine
judgment upon the nation for defending or IGNORING the issue of slavery.
Abraham Lincoln, in his second presidential inaugural address (March 4,
1865), stated that he believed that the Civil War was Divine retribution
for slavery. A few years before, in 1862, the great Baptist preacher,
Charles Spurgeon, warned:

"Remember, too, that the cause of this suffering is a national sin - the
sin of slavery. We have not yet passed the third generation, and upon a
nation God visits sin to the third and fourth generation. We have rid
ourselves, at last, of this accursed stain so far as our present
Government is concerned, we are therefore delivered from any fear in
future on that ground; but still, if slavery be now in America, we must
remember that it would not have been there if it had not been carried
there, and we are partners in guilt. Moreover, there has been too much
winking at slavery amongst the merchants of Manchester and Liverpool.
There has not been that abhorrence of the evil which should have been, and
therefore it is just in the Providence of God that when America is cut
with the sword we should be made to smart with the rod." (November 9,
1862)

As early as 1829, David Walker (1785-1830), a radical black abolitionist,
active in Baptist churches, wrote:

"...Christian Americans not only hinder their fellow creatures, the
Africans, but thousands of them will absolutely beat a colored person
nearly to death, if they catch him on his knees, supplicating the throne
of grace...[American preachers] have newspapers and monthly periodicals,
which they receive in continual succession, but on the pages of which, you
will scarcely ever find a paragraph respecting slavery, which is ten
thousand times more injurious to this country than all the other evils put
together; and which will BE THE FINAL OVERTHROW OF ITS GOVERNMENT, unless
something is very speedily done; for THIS CUP IS NEARLY FULL. Perhaps they
will laugh at, or make light of this; but I tell you Americans! that
UNLESS YOU SPEEDILY ALTER YOUR COURSE YOU AND YOUR COUNTRY ARE
GONE!!!!....This language, perhaps, is too harsh for the American's
delicate ears. But Oh Americans!! I warn you in the name of the Lord
(whether you will hear, or forbear,) to repent and reform, or YOU ARE
RUINED!!!...."

Southern states responded by forbidding the teaching of reading and
writing to blacks. When sin is tolerated, brushed aside, excused, or
justified, it is certainly true that the Lord of Heaven will judge His
people, and even whole nations that have received the light of His
Scriptures. Will God continue to ignore the cries of infants who are being
murdered in the womb?

CONCLUSION

This is the history that is being denied or hidden by liberals and
humanists. In the second part of this study, we will see if it is possible
to justify the American system of slavery from the Scriptures. And we will
see that it is not inconsistent to condemn homosexuality and modern
feminism, while at the same time condemning American slavery.

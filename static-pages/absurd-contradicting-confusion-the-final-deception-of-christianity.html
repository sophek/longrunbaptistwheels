            ABSURD, CONTRADICTING CONFUSION: THE FINAL DECEPTION OF CHRISTIANITY
The final assault on Christianity, will be an attack on knowledge. Satan, as a crafty, subtle serpent is sometimes very patient, waiting till "night" to hunt his prey. He has already laid the groundwork for Christianity to merge with Eastern Mysticism. Doctrine, intellectual knowledge, reason, etc. must take a secondary place to subjective experience and passionate emotion. "Reason" will be defined as part of man's "flesh". As in mysticism, it must be denied in Satan's new Christianity. "Faith" will be increasingly redefined to mean "belief in that which one has no evidence for". Such devilish statements as these are growing ever more common:

"If God gave us absolute proof, there would be no need for faith"

"Of course Christianity is largely a religion of faith, yet there are some convincing proofs in this video."

On the contrary, the creation is absolute proof of the Creator. (Ps.19:1-3) The Bible is absolute proof of God speaking, since it proves it's authenticity by infallible prophecy. (Isa.42:9) Whoever follows whatever this Bible says, is following the most reasonable, logical, intelligent path. Whoever does not follow the truth of the Bible, is following blindly after passion, lust and natural animal desire. (Jude 1:10) Notice these thoughts from an unbelieving humanist:

"Thought can only lead us to the knowledge that it cannot give us the ultimate answer.. the only way in which the world can be grasped, ultimately lies, not in thought, but in the act, in the experience of oneness."

"If the right thought is not the ultimate truth, and not the way to salvation, there is no reason to fight others, whose thinking has arrived at different formulations."

"In the dominant western religious system, the love of God is essentially the same as belief in God, in God's existence, God's justice, God's love. The love of God is essentially a thought experience. In the eastern religions and in mysticism, the love of God is an intense feeling experience of oneness.."Erich Fromm

Many of todays most discerning Christian ministries are promoting such mysticism. The philosophy of "absurd contradiction" has invaded Christianity. From the time of the Garden of Eden, Satan has used this same tactic:

"Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" " And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:" (Gen.3) We see that "absolutes" are erased. "Certainty" is attacked. Rational faith in God's sure, perfect Word is replaced with blind faith in that which has no proven basis. What reasons did Satan give? What evidence? Eve was set up to embrace what would later become Christianity mixed with Eastern Mysticism. It is the philosophy of CONTRADICTION AND ABSURDITY through subjective experience:

Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

Notice the words of one Eastern philosopher:

"My words are very easy to practice, but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practice them."
Lao-tse

When reason and intuitive passion meet as equals with the same authority, nothing but absurd chaos results. Nevertheless, this is what Eastern religions seek. This has entered Christianity through the Charismatic movement, modern psychology, and Lordship salvation, which erase objective intellectual certainty, and replace it with subjective experience. When one embraces a contradiction, with no Biblical support, one has become as a fool. Yet absurd contradictions run rampant in modern Christianity. Like the two-sides of the Serpent's forked tongue, double-minded Christians spout out contradictory statements with ease:

"I believe the Bible I read is perfect and inspired in every letter"...yet on their doctrinal statements these hypocritical Christian mystics say:

"We believe the Bible to be inspired and perfect in the original manuscripts." They hold the contradiction like good little Hindus. There are no originals anymore. Again:

"Salvation is free by grace through faith alone". ... yet, in their next few words:

"We must stand against this 'easy believism' that thinks all you need is mental belief. You must obey Christ as Lord and turn from sin."

These should admit they believe in salvation by grace through works, or become Buddhists.

"You can know absolutely that you are saved this very moment, and it can never be lost"... and yet... "Of course, the truly saved will bring forth fruit after conversion, and they will not continue in sin as a habit or practice."

Ezekiel 8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

It will continue. The philosophy of contradiction is found in almost all secular philosophies. Once all reason is gone, man is free to make the most unreasonable claims. Without enlightened reason to check his lust, man no longer has to follow "truth". Absurdity can be embraced in mad passion. In the philosophy of contradiction, man becomes his own authority. Such mysticism, always has and always will, lead to self-deification:

"If therefore I am changed into God and He makes me one with Himself, then by the living God, there is no distinction between us."
Johannes Meister Eckart (1260-1327)

"He imparted into you, when you were born again, Peter says it just as plain, that we are partakers of the divine nature. That nature is life eternal in absolute perfection and that was imparted, injected into your spirit, man, and you have that imparted in you, by God, just as you impart to your child the nature of humanity. That child wasn't born a whale he was born a human. Now is that true? You don't have a human do you? No you are one. You don't have a God in you, you are one!"
Kenneth Copeland

Many today hypocritically stand against this insanity as "false doctrine". Yet, they deny that there is a perfect Bible without mistakes anywhere on the earth. They teach contradictions and promote "blind faith" as a virtue. They promote an "inner voice" of Truth, on the basis that Christ's Sheep hear "His voice". Such mysticism, removed from a perfect Bible giving a perfect outward standard, ends with one needing a perfect church or priesthood to interpret and formulate "doctrine". Let us in love, stand against the Eastern Mystical seduction. It is probably closer to you than you think!

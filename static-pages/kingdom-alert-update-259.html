FROM THE EDITOR
***********************
I am sorry that I have not sent out a newsletter in a few weeks. The
server that stores the Kingdom Alert E-mail database has not been working,
and I was unable to get in touch with the company (GRC)! I was afraid I
had totally lost the whole list, but I was later able to find a copy of
the list from 2003. While in the process of trying to update this old list
(or trace down someone from GRC), the server suddenly began to work again!
I still do not know why it was down. But praise the Lord! Needless to say,
we have made some current copies of the list.

In these past few weeks, we have been praying for our new little baby girl
(our 4th girl, that is soon to be born in March!) to turn the right way.
Our three former girls were all born at home, and it was looking like
there would be complications. But we praise God that on the way to get an
ultrasound, she must have turned! It was great news to hear and see her
turned the right way that morning.

INTRODUCTION
**********************
By "CCM" in the below articles, I mean "Contemporary Christian Music."
However, I am aware that there is much "new" Christian music being
composed today by saints that is very holy in spirit and sound. Most of
this music is only heard in private churches, homes, etc., since the
big-time producers are looking for worldly music that pleases the sinful
flesh. Also, it is not my intention to be hurtful or over-critical,
especially in regard to non-musicians who are only trying to do the best
they can with what they know. Friends may disagree, and we can still walk
in love with one another. But may our love abound with knowledge and
judgment (Philippians 1:9-10). As a watchman, I seek to be helpful in
regard to this issue. There are many who are seeking to find out WHAT is
wrong. They suspect that something is not right. Recently, in speaking on
the street with some youth in a Christian rock (alternative) band, I
asked, "When you play, do the Christian sisters begin to move in an
indiscreet manner to the beat?" One boy looked down, as his conscience
answered my question. I gently explained that when the softer sounding
bass-drum is hit first, in any type of music, before the loud snare-drum
is struck, the beat is "backwards." It produces a "groove" sound, that
entices sensual body movement, instead of a marching movement. These
articles explore the birth of this upside-down beat, and its fruit. The
upside-down beat is the sound of immodesty, unisex, feminism, etc. It was
birthed at the same time these movements crawled out of the pit. It is, to
music, what these movements are to Biblical morality and the home.

****************************************
CCM AND THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
****************************************
Most Christians are aware that too many modern scientists worship time.
Time is held to be the mysterious, life-giving, life-sustaining,
life-moving power that transforms a bowl of eternal soup into a monkey.
The monkey then becomes a monkey-man, and then, finally, the time-god
transforms the monkey-man into a modern scientist (without the long tail).
Of course, no modern scientist has been around long enough to test this
theory of time. Time keeps killing them all before they can test it! Only
Mormons (or possibly Roman Catholics, and modern psychologists) can keep
up with the modern evolutionist in his blind faith in unproven fables (1
Timothy 4:7, 6:20). There are few greater soul-damning, fool-making,
Satanic lies than evolution and its Time-Idol for monkey-men.

However, I have noticed that many modern Christians have become somewhat
infected with this false concept of time. They have adopted the worldly
ideas of the evolutionist. The evolutionist believes that if you give a
ROCK enough time, it will begin to swim, crawl and "cluck" like a
chicken-a-saurus. In other words, they believe time can give life to a
ROCK. Likewise, many modern Christians believe that time can bring
spiritual life to ROCK MUSIC. Many (although this is quickly changing)
would not dare use modern "rock" sounds in their churches. Few saints
would even listen to such songs (or at least justify listening to them).
Yet, if you go back in time THIRTY-FIVE YEARS (1969-1970), they believe
that the sounds which were popular then, in mainstream rock (which at the
time were considered brazenly rebellious and devilish), have now become
SANCTIFIED BY TIME!

This is why if you will attend many modern churches (for example, a nice,
conservative, non-denominational church), you will likely find grown men
"moving" and singing to what sounds like a concert by Crosby, Steels and
Nash. Or, you might listen to a contemporary Christian song (even a
conservative one), and it sounds like CCR's "Midnight Special." Why is
this? One reason is that the 48 year-old male, who has a good computer
job, a working wife, and a child or two (who is stressed and depressed
from driving the kids to all their various lessons and hobbies on
Saturday, and never getting to see his family; who wonders if any day now
his wife will say that she doesn't feel like she is "in love," and will
file for divorce) is the "target" in many churches. He is a stable,
tithe-paying man. And thirty years ago, in the early seventies, he was
moving the same way, and singing the same way in concerts, that he now
does in church.

Of course, the churches in the late sixties and early seventies would have
considered such music to be Satanic and rebellious. It was considered
"druggie" music, and "hippie" music. It was created for the sexual
revolution. It was music that called kids to "light it up." The modern
theory (borrowed from the evolutionist) is that time has added life to
this old music of destruction and death; that time can add life to dead
rock. We are to believe that the music that stirred a generation to "light
up joints and bongs," can stir the same people (now thirty years older) to
light up their lives for God. This theory assumes that time can bring life
to the dead. It assumes that time can sanctify corruption.

As a man who has invested much of my life (from a young child) to rock
music and its spirit, I certainly know the objections to what I have
written here. But what is more important is that I know from experience
the fruit of such music. From playing in the worst bars, to later becoming
the associate pastor of "Heavenly Metal Ministries," I have observed the
destructive power of rock music, and the spirit which defends it. Music
creates an atmosphere; it therefore becomes an expression of an attitude,
a spirit. Is it a meek spirit? A reverent spirit? A holy spirit? A
contrite spirit? A modest spirit? Or is it a spirit or attitude of
throwing off restraints? Of rebellion? Of fleeing responsibility? Of
letting go? Of worldliness? Of promiscuity? Of drunkenness?

WHERE WILL THIS END? I remind the reader that when Elvis the Pelvis was
popular, the kids danced. The kids are still dancing - only, it is getting
so bad and disgusting that school officials are canceling school dances or
printing strict guidelines. Weak parents respond in news reports, "Well,
you know, they didn't like the way we danced when we were growing up." I
can't even write what the junior-high school children are simulating on
the dance-floor that such parents call "dancing."

Another example is the fact that 80 or so years ago, the newspapers around
the U.S. reported the shock and outcry against the fact that new women
jurists would be exposing their ankles and calves to the court room as
they sat to judge a case. The court provided them with a covering for the
table. But today, good, conservative, Baptist parents think it is cute to
dress their teenage girls (or younger) like harlots, or their little boys
like pimps. Teen-age girls expose stomachs, backs, thighs (and almost
everything else) IN CHURCH. Do we not see that the argument that, "This is
considered holy compared to what people do today," is an absurd argument?
WHERE WILL THIS END?

It is not difficult to see where this will end. Five years from now, the
music of conservative churches will sound like the rock music of the early
1980's. Therefore, supporters of this movement will have to begin teaching
that holiness is relative; that is, it simply consists of staying about
thirty years behind the world in its mad rush to destruction. This is, of
course, an insane viewpoint. Or else, they will have to teach that there
is a limit; that somewhere there is a line when music itself (apart from
lyrics) can become immoral, indecent, or at the very least, disorderly.
For example, if this hellish fall down the hill continues, will the Acid
Rock of the '70's, or the Death Metal of the '80's soon be justified as
"worship music" in conservative, mainstream churches? (Many
seeker-friendly churches are getting close already). Will Christians, when
this occurs, STILL maintain that music is entirely neutral, and that there
is no such thing as a sexual sound, or a rebellious, wrathful sound?
Perhaps many Christians will soon wake up, and confess that the whole idea
that music is neutral is a dangerous falsehood.

*********************************
CCM AND PROVING ALL THINGS
*********************************
1 Thessalonians 5:21 Prove ALL things; hold fast that which is good.
22 Abstain from ALL appearance of evil.

There is triumphant music, that has a patriotic or marching sound; it
brings a sense of reverence, as well as motivation. Then, there is music
that brings to mind the opposite of reverence, etc. It is not the shout of
triumph, or the awe-inspiring psalm to Jehovah God; it is the sound of
play and fornication. This all has to do with aesthetics. An example of
aesthetics is the nearly universal understanding that a bald woman looks
shocking, and that a woman with glorious, long hair, looks beautiful (1
Corinthians 11:15). All understand that the sounds of screaming would not
be delightful sounds to promote sleep. In the same way, while man's
natural, God-given senses may be perverted and hardened (or undeveloped),
a simple survey would prove that music communicates a certain sound; a
certain spirit; a certain attitude of mind. A "muse" (as in "music") is a
spirit.

A few simple tests would prove that music also influences the BODY. If a
worship band played Audio Adrenaline, or some other form of Christian
rock, an observer could sit back and watch hundreds of people begin to
move in a sensual manner. The hips would begin to rock or sway (some only
a little; others a whole lot). After three or four songs, there would be
more body movement. And then, if the band suddenly began to sing, "Crown
Him With Many Crowns," or "Praise Him! Jesus, our Blessed Redeemer!," (in
a right manner) the observer would be shocked to see absolute changes in
the way the bodies begin to move. The songs are still loud; they are
lively. But SUGGESTIVE, INDISCREET movements are suddenly absent
throughout the congregation!

Why have not such tests been conducted? Someone replies that it would be
unseemly to video the hips of Christians. I agree; especially when they
are "rocking out" to the upside-down, rock beat! However, I am mainly
calling for a simple test to be conducted in regard to the BODILY CHANGES
that take place when a congregation of 500 Christians goes from hearing a
Christian rock song to a true revival hymn. Notice, this test would have
nothing to do with fast music compared to slow music, or loud music
compared to soft music, or lively music compared to invitation music, etc.
We are only examining the change in FEEL between two types of beats. And I
challenge any supporter of CCM to perform the test, with no prior
information being given to the congregation. As sure as two plus two is
four, the bodily movement for one set of songs will be like the bodily
movement on MTV. The other will be something like marching or turning back
and forth, with hand clapping (on 1 and 3) in a happy, lively, NON-SEXUAL
manner.
 
What is it that makes the difference in the music? It is not the tempo
(fast or slow). It is not the volume. It is not even whether there is a
drum. But something in the two different types of music causes a dramatic
change in body movement. What it is? It can only be one thing. The BEAT is
different.

It is therefore time to answer the question. It is time to tell us which
beat will encourage sexual movements and which beat will restrain them. It
is also time to PROVE the answer by TESTING IT ON CROWDS. WHERE IS THE
TESTING? Why are researchers with video technology so silent? It is
because the answer is obvious: The sex beat (wherever it is found,
regardless of the music), leads to sexually-suggestive movement of the
body.

**************************************************************
CCM: WILL A JEWEL IN A SWINE'S SNOUT MAKE A PRETTY PIG?
**************************************************************
Proverbs 11:22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
which is without discretion.

Deuteronomy 7:25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire:
thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto
thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD
thy God.
26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be
a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt
utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

The beat found in most CCM (whether rock, country, swing, or soul) is the
popular rock beat (when the bass drum is hit first on a drum kit, and then
the snare is hit, creating a soft-HARD, soft-HARD, sound):

"The big change that took place in music rhythmically was the shift away
from the Ooom-pah-Ooom-pah (1-2-3-4) rhythmic structure. Ooom-pah has a
strong accent on '1.'...Ragtime musicians often used what are called
'ragged' rhythms."
("The Origin of Big Band Music and Jazz", Bob Thomas, 1994
http://www.redhotjazz.com/bigband.html)

This beat was birthed (in modern times in the West) in the WHOREHOUSES of
the 19th century. The musicians who created this beat (i.e. the piano
players, downstairs in the brothels) tell us that they first began to use
it for the purpose of getting men ready for the prostitutes. The music
(the beat) was spawned for the purpose of fornication. It was not created
for worship. It was not even created for entertainment. It was created for
business; sleazy business!

Soon, the BROTHEL MUSIC was ready to make its way out into the mainstream
of American life. It brought nothing but rebellion and destruction (as
proven by the 20th century). By the early 1920's, fundamental preachers
(such as I.M. Haldeman), and conservative women, were sounding a warning
that a sexual revolution (leading to unimaginable abominations) was at
hand, due in part to the new jazz music. For example, Anne Shaw Faulkner
(National Music Chairman of the General Federation of Women's Clubs), in
1921, warned against the new jazz music. If her warnings had any merit in
that day, how much more do they apply today, when the music has been
stretching the limits for multiple generations? Time cannot sanctify an
unholy root. However, it does often EXPOSE THE HIDDEN CORRUPTION. Time has
proven that much of Faulkner's observations were more correct than modern
historians would care to admit:
 
 "...in the surveys made by many organizations regarding these [immoral]
conditions, the blame is laid on jazz music and its evil influence on the
young people of today. Never before have such outrageous dances been
permitted in private as well as public ballrooms, and never has there been
used for the accompaniment of the dance such a strange combination of tone
and rhythm as that produced by the dance orchestras of today. Certainly,
if this music is in any way responsible for the condition and for the
immoral acts which can be traced to the influence of these dances, then it
is high time that the question should be raised: 'Can music ever be an
influence for evil?'....Today, however, the first great rebellion against
jazz music and such dances as the 'toddle' and the 'shimmy' comes from the
dancing masters themselves. Realizing the evil influence of this type of
music and dancing, the National Dancing Masters' Association, at their
last session, adopted this rule: 'Don't permit vulgar cheap jazz music to
be played. Such music almost forces dancers to use jerky half-steps, and
invites immoral variations...'....Jazz originally was the accompaniment of
the voodoo dancer, stimulating the half-crazed barbarian to the vilest
deeds. The weird chant, accompanied by the syncopated rhythm of the voodoo
invokers, has also been employed by other barbaric people to stimulate
brutality and sensuality. That it has a demoralizing effect upon the human
brain has been demonstrated by many scientists. There is always a
revolutionary period of the breaking down of old conventions and customs
which follows after every great war; and this rebellion against existing
conditions is to be noticed in all life today. Unrest, the desire to break
the shackles of old ideas and forms are abroad. So it is no wonder that
young people should have become so imbued WITH THIS SPIRIT that they
should express it in every phase of their daily lives. The question is
whether this tendency should be demonstrated in jazz - that expression of
protest against law and order, that bolshevik element of license striving
for expression in music. The human organism responds to musical
vibrations. This fact is universally recognized. What instincts then are
aroused by jazz? Certainly not deeds of valor or martial courage, for all
marches and patriotic hymns are of regular rhythm and simple harmony;
decidedly not contentment or serenity, for the songs of home and the love
of native land are all of the simplest melody and harmony with noticeably
regular rhythm. Jazz disorganizes all regular laws and order; it
stimulates to extreme deeds, to a breaking away from all rules and
conventions; it is harmful and dangerous, and its influence is wholly bad.
A number of scientific men who have been working on experiments in
musico-therapy with the insane, declare that while regular rhythms and
simple tones produce a quieting effect on the brain of even a violent
patient, the effect of jazz on the normal brain produces an atrophied
condition on the brain cells of conception, until very frequently those
under the demoralizing influence of the persistent use of syncopation,
combined with inharmonic partial tones, are actually incapable of
distinguishing between good and evil, right and wrong."
(Anne Shaw Faulkner, "Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation"; "Ladies'
Home Journal," August 1921)

Why was the new jazz music associated with so much sin? It began in sin!
IT (and its "rock" daughter) IS THE SPIRIT OF SIN PAINTED IN MUSIC. You
may place a jewel in a swine's snout; but it will not make the muddy swine
look much better (Proverbs 11:22). You can build an expensive ballpark or
theater in a dirty city. But it will not hide the sin that is corrupting
the city. In the same way, you can use the background music that has been
created for fornication and whoredoms, and place godly lyrics in the midst
of this background, but the background will be no cleaner than the ugly,
stinking, dirty pig with a jewel in her snout!

The ragtime and jazz musicians had their start in the whorehouses and
clubs of the "red light district." This music (or its beat) evolved into
rock 'n roll in all its various forms. For example, Leadbelly (1888-1949)
developed the same, rhythmic guitar style that was used by the barrelhouse
piano players in Shreveport's sleazy, red-light district, where he worked
as a youth.

Ragtime (the rag or rock beat) became a new music for a new age. It was
considered "good time" music, that lacked the sobriety and reverence of
the "acceptable" music of the time:

"Why do you like ragtime? The most important thing I find about
ragtime...is that it was...not the acceptable type of music...that one
would normally wish to hear, but 'goodtime' music you would hear in the
honky-tonks and whorehouses and taprooms of the red-light districts [when]
going to hear someone like Jelly Roll Morton..."
(http://www.ragtimers.org/~ragtimers/faq/whyrag.html)

Jelly Roll Morton (1890-1941) was one of the first Jazz composers and
piano players. As a teenager Jelly Roll Morton worked in the Storyville
whorehouses. He worked as a pimp, gambler, and pianist! His whorehouse
"beat" is the beat that much of modern Christian music (of whatever style)
now utilizes for the background of Christian lyrics.

In the same manner, Scott Joplin (1868-1917) is known for bringing ragtime
out of its red-light district origins into the mainstream.

Thomas A. Dorsey is considered to be the father of black gospel music. In,
"The Rise of Gospel Blues," author Michael W. Harris quotes Dorsey and
others, openly confessing that they would have female blues singers
perform in bars on Saturday night, and make soulish sounds (to sexual
lyrics), and then simply add the word "Jesus" to these same sounds on
Sunday morning! Dorsey was greatly opposed by black Christians in his day
for bringing the old whorehouse and bar music into the churches, and
hindering the spiritual maturity and renewal of black Christians. The
issue of the beat and mood of the music was often obscured into a debate
between southern and northern ways. Today, many attempt to change the
issue into a debate between black and white music, instead of a debate
between whorehouse and holy worship sounds. There were hundreds of holy,
black "spirituals" that had little to do with the ragtime and early jazz
sounds of brothels and bars.
 
The fact that the rock beat began as music to promote fornication is (or
should be) common knowledge. The beat was played fast or slow; but it
produced the same sinful effect. The slow, soulish, syncopated blues began
(according to the old musicians themselves), not because of slavery, but
because they needed sexually-enticing music that would not be so LOUD and
reveling that it would alert the LAW to the brothels!

It is absurd to deny that this syncopated beat had its birth in the
brothels. Notice the confession of a writer in the "Chicago Tribune":

"Some otherwise astute musical academicians still dismiss ragtime as
'whorehouse music.' IT WAS THAT, but it isn't dismissible."
(Chicago Tribune, July 6, 1975, Reviewed by John Brooks)
 
The following rebellious response is typical of those who are looking to
justify their bar sounds:

"Bill Gothard, one popular fundamentalist teacher, actually preached that
the syncopated 4/4 beat of rock and roll collided with the natural rhythm
of the human heart and would therefore make the listeners sick....[He
teaches that] the rhythm must be in 4/4 time, with the first and third
beats emphasized slightly. Since his prescription rarely existed even
among adult contemporary music, he was happy to offer his own recordings
for sale."
(John J. Thompson, "The Story of Christian Rock & Roll...", p. 30)

Notice the implied judging of motives (i.e. Gothard is only trying to make
money), and the refusal to deal with the real issue. The issue is not
whether or not one beat makes people sick (although man is certainly
rhythmic in heartbeat, respiration, gait and speech). The issue is whether
or not a certain beat TEMPTS people to move in a sexual manner. Is it a
stumbling-block for young (or old) Christians? In these days of immodest
dressing (to fit the wild, lawless spirit of the music), is it wise to
play sounds that tempt Christians to move the pelvis like Elvis?

The real issue is not tempo, volume, harmony or instrumentation, as much
as it is the beat and feel of the music. Certainly, the breathy, "I just
woke up from a one-night stand, I have a hangover, and I am smoking a
cigarette," vocal sound that producers are leading Christian men and women
to mimic is sad (and the immodest dress and look often match the breathy
vocal sound). The shallow lyrical content of many songs today (where the
listener does not know if the song is about Jesus Christ or a pet bunny)
is also alarming. However, we must not lose sight of the main issues
concerning the music. Where did it come from? What has been its fruit?
Does it tempt the body to move in a sexual manner, or a holy, reverent
manner? In spite of the lyrics, what attitude or spirit is being portrayed
by the music?
 
*************************************
DEAD MUSIC FOR DEAD PHARISEES?
*************************************
It is not pharisaical to teach that if the beat of the music will tempt
many members of a congregation to sway their hips and move in a sexual
manner, that it should be rejected as worship music. There is great room
for liberty in music. We should not judge one another in minor matters.
However, tempting Christians with BROTHEL SOUNDS is not a "minor" matter.
It might qualify as "strange fire" (Leviticus 10:1).

True, there are many Christians that are simply looking for a reason to be
hateful and mean. They are looking for one more thing to make them feel
holier than others and self-righteous. We should remember that without
charity, we are nothing.

There are also churches that think that anything that sounds like it would
REVIVE a bunch of pew sitting, arm-chair, cozy Christians must be of the
Devil. Only the Devil could tempt people to read the Psalms in such
blindness. The God of the Bible is a God of triumph. He is a God of
victory. He is a terrible, merciful, good, holy God that has done great
things for His people. He is to be worshipped with rejoicing, but also
with trembling! He is not the dead or absent god of the deist. The Lord's
Day is a day that we should be glad in, and rejoice in! Music should
motivate saints to worship and OBEY this wonderful, triumphant King who
has redeemed His people in so marvelous a manner. Where are the cymbals?
Where are the loud shouts? Where is the praise? The clapping of hands? The
praise? If not in body, let it at least be present in spirit! When music
is played with the right beat, it can afford to be lively without
inhibition. Christians will not be able to disco-dance or rap-dance to it,
even if they wanted to. The martial beat would break their necks. It is
sad to see conservative Christians attempting to worship God with music
that is upside down. They know they must restrain their movements, and
they would die if they appeared suggestive or indiscreet. But they are
having to fight the music. The music is trying to move the pelvis, and
they are gritting their teeth and sweating, trying to hold back the
indiscreet movements! Yet, there is usually one or two who will just let
the music lead them. Why not turn the beat right-side up so these
Christians can worship God freely? When rejoicing, let it be loud, lively,
triumphant, and glorious! Let them run, clap, march, jump, or shout:

Psalms 47:1 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
voice of triumph.
2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the
earth.
7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
understanding.

When the beat is straight (clapping or hitting the snare on 1 and 3 when
in 4/4 time, instead of 2 and 4), they will not be tempted to move in a
unclean manner.

Perhaps the music is dead because so many Christians are dead. The cares
and pleasures of the world are choking the word of the kingdom in too many
saints. The lack of confession of sins is causing saints to shy away from
expression in worship.

Often, there are simply judgmental, self-righteous attitudes that hinder
worship and revival. They tried to stop blind Bartimaeus from shouting,
but he cried louder and was heard (Mark 10:48). The Pharisees tried to
stop the multitude from shouting loud praises to Jesus, but He warned them
that the stones would cry out the same praises (Luke 19:37-40). I do not
deny that the same RELIGIOUS harshness that was in many of the early
disciples who attempted to silence Bartimaeus, or prevent the little ones
from coming to Him, is likely present in a greater degree today, when the
love of so many is waxing cold.

However, the harshness and extremes of many are also being used by evil
men and seducers to make merchandise of the many saints in the name of
liberty (2 Peter 2). And they are ensnaring many Christians into the
bondage of sin. And when their mercenary wiles are exposed, they have been
trained to shout, "Judgmental Pharisee!" to hide their sins. Let every
preacher know that tempting immodest, Christian women to move their hips
to "brothel music" on the Lord's Day will only lead to an increase of sin
and fornication and shipwrecked lives. Many will be shipwrecked by the
worldly entertainment (music, movies, magazines, etc.) that they refuse to
depart from in their private lives. In years of preaching, I have seen
very few fall that were rightly separated from such things. Yet, if these
things cannot be totally stopped in private, should we sanction them in
the church?

But we are told that such a beat will draw a crowd. We are told that we
should encourage all opposers to this new music to find another church.
These Warrenites believe that they are simply continuing in the
progressive tradition of a Watts or a Wesley (or perhaps a Moody). They
never answer whether or not this "progress" will ever FALL OVERBOARD ON
THE OTHER SIDE! It is one thing to reform a Gregorian chant from the dark
ages. It is another thing to go from Luther to Watts to Wesley to Moody to
Billy Sunday to Billy Graham (DC Talk), and then tell us that we must KEEP
ON PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES! Such logic, if continued, will soon have
Christians wearing nothing but jungle aprons, cutting themselves, painting
themselves, and fornicating to bongo drums as a religious ceremony, and
throwing their children into the fire (I know we are already here in many
ways).

Anyone who uses the argument that if you question something, examine
something, and/or object to something, you are a Pharisee, is using the
methodology of the cults.

Notice how absurd Rick Warren's popular argument is when it is applied to
dress. What if we responded to any claim that a certain attire was
immodest (meaning, according to Oxford, "pertaining to whores") by
pointing out that this claim was made in early days about EXPOSED ARMS OR
ANKLES? It is obvious that this argument has been made for numerous
generations, to the point that it now actually excuses (in the minds of
many) the dress of harlots! Almost anything can be exposed today, without
a blush, on the basis that our forefathers held to some prudish or extreme
standards.

No, we may debate whether or not the music of the Moody revivals, or the
Billy Sunday revivals, was justified. But when Christians continue to
stretch the boundaries, and they use these early revivals to justify
BLATANT rock music, the landmarks are obliterated (Proverbs 22:28); the
foundations are destroyed (Psalms 11:3). There is no stopping the FALL
into utter depravity and abomination:

Deuteronomy 12:31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods;
for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to
their gods.

No matter what music is used (death metal or punk rock!), it will soon be
justified in church on the grounds that, "We are simply doing the same
thing that Luther, Watts or Moody did in their days." But we might argue
that what was permissible in purer days, is dangerous in darker days of
apostasy and rebellion.

The "Wesley was also criticized" argument sounds at first like a good
covering to justify the "seeker friendly" methodology concerning pop
music. But perhaps the excuse came to the end of its rope a few
generations ago! Perhaps the pendulum has already swung far the other way.
I believe it has. I believe Laodicea is blind to its nakedness. I believe
there is strange fire that is being offered up to the Lord. It is the fire
of the BROTHEL. It is the spirit and sound of lust. We are commanded to
flee it.

SUGGESTION FOR PASTORS WITH NO MUSICAL TRAINING: If you do not have
musicians who understand the difference between the march beat and the
worldly-dance beat, simply examine the effects of various songs on the
congregation. A good song can be played wrong (especially in worship bands
with a drummer who has been taught wrong). If the pastor's wife is
discerning and God-fearing, and seeking the Lord in this issue, have her
stand at the back of the church and notice the bodily movements of the
women in the church during praise and worship time. Begin to purge every
song that stirs the slightest suggestion of lewd dancing or movement in
the hips of the women. An evil spirit is in it - A PELVIS SPIRIT! The
spirit will not be resisted by simply hiding or burying the drummer. He
must learn to play right! Getting rid of the drummer doesn't fix the other
musicians who may still emphasize a wrong rhythm. And one problem (for
these modern, perverse times) is that it often leaves the background beat
open to individual interpretation. In this day and age, if there is no
background automatically set for the worshipper (such as the marching
beat), the groove beat will be automatically assumed, unawares, by many
church members (especially if contemporary choruses are played). Many have
not heard any other type of music. They know no other background for a
melody. If you keep drums (i.e. tabrets, timbrels and cymbals in the OT),
start by removing the bass drum from the drum kit. Ask the drummer to beat
the snare beginning on the first (strong) beat, and to thus play a
martial, manly, patriotic, reverent sound, and get rid of the "boom-CHICK,
boom-boom-CHICK, boom-CHICK, boom-boom-CHICK" (bass-SNARE,
bass-bass-SNARE) sounds. If you have a worship leader who claps, ask him
to clap on beats 1 and 3 (instead of 2 and 4). Most of the modern songs
are designed only for the rock beat. Replace all questionable songs with
lively, revival songs in the spirit and feel of, "Praise to Lord, the
Almighty," "I Sing the Mighty Power of God," "To God Be the Glory,"
"Revive Us Again," "Come Thou Almighty King," etc.).

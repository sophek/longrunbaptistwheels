-Babylon Awakens....So Does Islam!Â 
1 Timothy 2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;Â 
2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.Â

This is issue #200 of the Kingdom Alert! Thank you for reading and praying for this weekly ministry!Â

THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT IRAQI WAR: BABYLON WILL RISE!Â 
We pray for our troops to be safe and victorious, and that innocent civilians will be protected at home and in Iraq. We rejoice in hope that the people of Iraq will be free from an abusive government. The Lord has ordained the nations to use the sword justly to defend their homelands (Romans 13). Nations are not called to appease those who endanger them. In American history, the success of president Jefferson's speedy and sharp actions against the pirates should be a lesson to modern, naive pacifists. Civil government (especially in lands where God's light has shined) is called by God to properly punish evil-doers who threaten the security of its people. It must also make sure it upholds religious liberty so that Christian workers may freely spread the Gospel without hindrance.Â 
Much of the modern trouble with Islamic terrorism is due to almost a century of appeasement and compromise by the West, both politically and spiritually. As early as 1949, G. H. Lang was sounding the alarm:Â 
"...it is a most serious offence that a nation should openly and officially SANCTION Islam. It is an outrage against the Father and the Son....Of this offence the British government has been persistently guilty over a long stretch of time. In general, its agents have been helpful when it has been a question of the spread of the Gospel among heathen people, but in Moslem countries ruled by England, the opposite policy has been followed. Government offices seemed determined to hinder the work as far as possible....Instances of this could be given from my own experience, as well as that of many others. The ground of this policy may seem intelligible from the point of view of worldly prudence, but it is without excuse in the sight of God. The Moslem peoples are excitable and their religion makes them fanatical. England has had half or more of the Moslem world under its control or influence, and it has PANDERED to their religion in the hope of avoiding disturbances and securing their support. That a Government should protect all its subjects in the free exercise of their religion is very proper: that it should HINDER some of its subjects in seeking to enlighten the others as to the truth of God is to invite the indignation of God. I have never known the English officials to hinder the Moslems from spreading THEIR religion. When in 1883 Lord Cromer took control in Egypt an American of very long residence in that land said (or wrote) to him that the Moslem will accept with complacency anything that comes to him with something of the finality of a Divine decree, but he very well knows how to exploit WEAKNESS....Whatsoever a Government sows THAT shall it also reap, and today Britain has to pay the bill for its false and God-dishonoring policy towards Islam. It sowed the wind, it is reaping the whirlwind....it is Islamic peoples that are today causing Britain its major anxieties..."Â 
("World Chaos," 1949)Â 
Lang's words are even more true today. With such early warnings before us, there is some ground for applauding the tough actions taken by the U.S. and England against "terrorists" in the CRADLE of civilization (Genesis 11:1-2, 9). However, these same two countries enforce laws that cause MILLIONS of innocent babies to be "terrorized" in the WOMB! Anyone familiar with the Bible would therefore find cause to be alarmed at such a realization, especially in a time of war (Proverbs 21:13, 24:11-12, Mark 9:42). And should we relax when we consider the fact that public prayers have been offered by our President (who professes to be a Christian) to the god of the Islam? May the Lord have mercy on us.Â 
Congressman Ron Paul has noted some other problems with the present war which have nothing to do with the issues raised by Hollywood's "stars":Â 
"Our anticipated war in Iraq has been condemned by many around the world for the worst of all reasons: namely, that America is acting without United Nations approval. The obvious implication is that an invasion of Iraq is illegitimate without such approval, but magically becomes legitimate when UN bureaucrats grant their blessing....The bizarre irony is while we may act unilaterally in Iraq, the very justification for our invasion is that we are enforcing UN resolutions!....It's bad enough when Congress RELINQUISHES its war-making authority TO THE PRESIDENT, but disastrous if we relinquish it to INTERNATIONAL BUREAUCRATS who don't care about America...." (March 17, 2003, "Texas Straight Talk")Â 
The "New American Magazine" agrees. In their latest issue, they quote President Bush as stating that military action against Iraq is necessary to enforce the authority, relevance, and WILL of the United Nations:Â 
"The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations....All the world now faces a test, and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced, or will it be irrelevant?....We want the United Nations resolutions to be effective...and successful....We want the resolutions of the world's most important multilateral body to be enforced..."Â 
(President George W. Bush, Sept. 12, 2002, address to the UN General Assembly)Â 
"If force becomes necessary to disarm Iraq and enforce the will of the United Nations....America will act victoriously..."(President Bush, Feb. 13th, 2003)Â 
The elder Bush, after the first Gulf War, stated in a nationwide address:Â 
"This is an historic moment....We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a New World Order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of the nations. When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at the New World Order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN founders."Â 
The danger in "empowering" the United Nations (or whatever international organization may arise to replace it) is that these globalists do not hide the fact that they desire "international law" to be imposed in practically every area of society:Â 
"Those bureaucrats are not satisfied by meddling only in international disputes, however. The UN increasingly wants to influence our domestic environmental, trade, labor, tax, and gun laws. Its global planners fully intend to expand the UN into a true world government, complete with taxes, courts, and a standing army. This is not an alarmist statement; these facts are readily promoted on the UNâ€™s own website." (Ron Paul, March 17, 2003)Â 
G. H. Lang wrote in 1949:Â 
"If this policy and influence be continued, the result can only be that the United Nations will sink to the same condition of wickedness and misery to which the Nazis dragged Germany..." ("World Chaos," 1949)Â 
Gary Kah, in 1992, predicted a future crisis in the Middle East that would increase the power of the new world order:Â 
"Two world wars have already been fought in the twentieth century. In each case, an aggressive power was used to ignite a crisis that drew in the rest of the world; and both times the aggressor was defeated. After each war, a supranational organization was established for the alleged purpose of promoting world peace, first the League of Nations, then the United Nations. Each organization has brought us one step closer to the realization of a one-world government....The U.N. lacks only the POWER to implement and ENFORCE its strategies....the world's next major conflict will undoubtedly be sparked by the hotbed of tensions surrounding the Middle East. If not Iraq a second time, then perhaps Iran or Syria."Â 
("Enroute to Global Occupation," 1992)Â 
We should not think for a moment that these globalists plan to leave RELIGION free from their meddling:Â 
"Our way of life as individuals and as citizens of the nations; our families and our jobs; our trade and commerce and money; our education systems and OUR RELIGIONS and our cultures; even the badges of our national identity, which most of us have always taken for granted - all will have been powerfully and radically altered forever. No one can be exempted from its effects. No sector of our lives will remain untouched."Â 
(Malachi Martin, "The Keys of this Blood<em>,</em>" page 15; 1990)Â 
Â 
Robert Muller has been called the "father of global education." He was a former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations. Notice some alarming quotes from Muller:Â 
"The world's RELIGIONS must speed up dramatically their ecumenical movement and recognize the unity of their objectives in the diversity of their cults....'My religion, right or wrong,' and 'My nation, right or wrong,' must be abandoned forever in the planetary age."Â 
"[Religions should] create common world religious institutions [and]...display the U.N. flag in all houses of worship."Â 
"We must move as quickly as possible to a one-world government; a one world religion; under a one-world leader."Â 
"Do not worry if not all religions will join the United religions organization. Many nations did not join the UN at its beginning, but later regretted it and made every effort to join. It was the same with the European community and it will be the case with the world's religions because whoever stays out or aloof will sooner or later regret it."Â 
Today, we repeatedly hear that this war "on terrorism" is NOT an attack on "ISLAM." This is because the globalists desire to disassociate EVERY religion from its FUNDAMENTAL base. They cannot have a world government until the religious BARRIERS are torn down. Therefore, the wars in the Middle East are NOT an attack on "ecumenical Islam" (which fits nicely into the new world order). They ARE an attack on FUNDAMENTAL ISLAM. There cannot be a working new world order until the forces of "fundamentalism" in Christianity, Judaism and Islam are tamed. The "taming" has first been (and will continue to be) through emotional propaganda. Preachers with charisma are financed to become "national celebrities." They then appear on talk shows and endorse interdenominationalism and interfaithism (i.e. the idea that Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, etc. are already saved if they are "good," even if they do not know the name of Jesus). However, there is a point where the taming must also become violent:Â 
"Internationalism today can ONLY be a federation forced by coercion."Â 
(D. M. Panton, 1925)Â 
Some say the wars in the Middle East are about oil. Others say they are to protect us from terrorists. There are often mixed motives for war. The Civil War freed the U.S. from the moral blight of slavery. Yet, it also severely limited the rights of the states, and increased the power of the federal government. States that did not comply were punished. This same pattern is presently occurring on a global scale. And once again, there are moral justifications offered for limiting the sovereignty of some nations by force.Â 
But let us never forget that the desire of the "globalist financiers" is to have a monopoly over the world's resources, trade, communications, etc. This cannot occur as long as there are RELIGIOUS barriers. Therefore, to accomplish this goal, all "exclusive fundamentalism" (in every religion) must be attacked doctrinally, and, if need be, with force.Â 
Â 
Indeed, according to the Bible, a world government will one day arise that will not acknowledge ANY rights of individuals or nations:Â 
Revelation 13:16 And he [the final Antichrist] causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:Â 
There are previous stages in the coming Tribulation period that lead up to this final time of darkness.Â 
Babylon Awakens....So Does Islam!Â 
Before the West gains totalitarian power, and the Antichrist takes control, three previous kingdoms must rise and fall in the Tribulation Period. Iraq will be the first kingdom of the Tribulation period (after the rapture) that will arise. Previous Kingdom Alerts have explained the prophecies concerning the rise of Iraq in detail (see these articles organized at http://www.kingdombaptist.org under "Iraq/Babylon," on the left hand side). Notice a few quotes from one of the first articles on this subject:Â 
"...the common Premillennial interpretation of Daniel 2 is that all of the prophecy in regard to the four kingdoms has been fully fulfilled except the last stage of the fourth Roman kingdom....The Bible says the Kingdom of God is set up 'in the days of these kings.' It goes further and removes all doubt about what that means. It says it will consume 'all these kingdoms.'....It therefore follows that not only should one expect to find 'double fulfillments' in Daniel, there is direct evidence for it. The Bible is therefore teaching that Babylon (i.e. Iraq), Persia (i.e. Iran), Greece and Rome will all come to power in this order in the coming Tribulation Period." (Kingdom Alert, March, 1999)Â 
We do not know the precise manner in which the Babylonian kingdom will rise to power. We may only speculate and offer some possibilities. It may be that the "eagle" will indeed "build in the mouth of the lion." It may be that the U.S. (U.N.) will "liberate" Iraq (and therefore the city of Babylon) so that it may become the world's "new age" center.Â 
On the other hand, we must not rule out the possibility that God will allow the Muslims to chastise the West. It may be that the goals of the globalists are delayed by an Islamic invasion. Anything is possible with God, and it does not even appear unreasonable when the rapture is factored into the equation. Muslims have been looking for a "messiah" to arise. And their growth in the 20th century has been phenomenal.Â 
The Director of the Islamic News Service (London) wrote in 1927:Â 
"At this period, entering upon a New Year, it behooves us all to look around and see the position of Islam in the West....Those who prophesied the decline in Islam have seen their predictions falsified, for Islam is gaining ground throughout the world....in countries nominally Christian, the bulk of people never enter a church. We must not relax our efforts in any way, for it seems that a new missionary campaign is in the air....Muslims! be up and doing, and bring to the Light those who are now groping in darkness."Â 
In the same year, Oswald J. Smith also noticed this Islamic awakening:Â 
"The headlines in the daily press read as follows: 'Islam will unite in Eastern League...Moslems awaken to a new sense of power."Â 
("Is The Antichrist at Hand?," 1927)Â 
A few years later, D. M. Panton noted:Â 
"The Pan-Islamic Congress, which recently met in Jerusalem, was the largest and most enthusiastic meeting of Moslems in the century. Elaborate plans were enthusiastically adopted for the most ambitious westward drive of that religion in 400 years."Â 
("The Dawn," Sept. 15, 1934)Â 
While the religion of Islam was invading the West (without the sword), in the same year (1934), there was not a single representative of the Gospel among Afghanistan's 9,000,000 Moslems! In recent years, it is said that out of "every four humans in the world, one of them is Muslim. Muslims have increased by over 235 percent in the last fifty years up to nearly 1.6 billion." (Islamicweb.com) If only a quarter of these people are willing to obey fundamental Islam and kill for their faith (e.g. suicide missions, etc.), it is not unreasonable to imagine the possibility that they may one day be organized under a fanatical leader to begin to fulfill the Bible's prophecies:Â 
Habakkuk 1:5 ....wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will NOT BELIEVE, though it be told you.Â 
6 For, lo, I RAISE UP the Chaldeans, that BITTER and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.Â 
7 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.Â 
10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.Â 
12 ...O mighty God, THOU hast established them for CORRECTION.Â 
Daniel 7:3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.Â 
4 The first was like a LION [Babylon], and had eagle's wings...Â 
Let us repent and seek the Lord in prayer for our country. Regardless of how this present war ends, Babylon will continue to rise. The time may be nearer than we realize. Should we gamble and say the Lord delayeth His coming (Matthew 24:48)? The rapture may be at hand today. Can we say we are ready? When Jesus comes, will He find you watching (Luke 21:36)? Should not Christians be "up and doing"? What does it mean when Muslims are more interested in converting souls to Islam than Christians are about saving them from eternal fire?:Â 
1 Corinthians 9:22 ....that I might by all means save some.Â

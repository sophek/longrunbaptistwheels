        <h1>CHRISTIAN WOMEN: RESIST THE DEVIL AND SAVE YOUR FAMILY! (BY JOEY AND EBBYE FAUST)</h1>
        <div id="content">
            There is a massive attack on men and manhood in the world today (see "The Biblical Husband: Restoring True Manhood in an Effeminate Age" by Joey Faust). This fact is sadly confirmed from day to day in so many ways. Ironically, by assaulting men and true masculinity, the Devil is ultimately launching his greatest assault on women. His plan from the beginning of creation has been to beguile and use the woman to destroy all that is holy and good. Feminists and carnal women are delighted to hear the world demean men and Biblical masculinity. They are delighted to hear the lie that they have a right to break commitments and holy vows for the sake of their feelings or "needs". They will rip up the family and pervert God's order and design for the sake of their own self-love. Yet, the Christian woman should be found standing strong and firm against such childish nonsense. She should be showing forth the strength of true, Biblical femininity by truly loving her husband and children in the face of worldly lies and ignorance. When women obey the Devil and destroy their families, evil escalates. Psychologists then get richer from everyone's "problems." To thwart the developing anarchy, government gains more power and control over private citizens. Many behind the scenes therefore have monetary and/or political reasons for deceiving (or bribing) gullible women into divorcing their husbands. Yet, there is no excuse for Christian women to be deceived! There is no excuse for Christian women to leave their husbands and destroy their families. They should know better: 2 Corinthians 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. Christian men need to wake up and realize what movies, TV, worldly books and magazines, secular music, etc. will do to a woman's mind. The "Cosmopolitan" magazine lying on the coffee table may be the cause of divorce next month in your otherwise, happy Christian family. Oh no man, you are no "legalist." You know how to sit back and enjoy some good TV time, etc. It is the other men at work and church that lose their families. It will not happen to you. Those men must have been doing something wrong, right? No, you do not understand the danger of this world's entertainment. You are like a gullible child accepting candy from a stranger. The poison simply hasn't "hit" yet. The Devil tempts many. Yet, Christian fools tempt the Devil! Christian women need to be strong and realize what the Devil is doing. Christian men cannot be counted on in these last days to watch over their families. Let us notice some recent examples of how the world and the Devil seek to seduce the minds of gullible women: "...the current APA issue of The American Psychologist claims in an article, 'Deconstructing the Essential Father,' that fathers and two-parent heterosexual marriages are not necessary for the psychological health of children. '[W]e do not believe that the data support the conclusion that fathers are essential to child well-being and that heterosexual marriage is the social context in which responsible fathering is most likely to occur,' wrote Drs. Louise B. Silverstein and Carl F. Auerbach. The authors also concluded, "divorce does not irretrievably harm the majority of children." (The Federalist Digest) How silly many Christians now look. Not long ago the same APA reported that molesting children does not harm them. Now they are reporting that they have "scientifically" discovered that it is fine and good for children not to have fathers in the home! The Christian media is of course outraged. They see this as "bad" science. No, it is FALSE science! The founders of psychology (Freud, Jung, Fromm, Maslow, etc.) believed things far worse than anything the APA has put out recently. The whole thing is a crock of baloney. Psychology has been ungodly from the very start. It is based upon the materialist's model of man. Nevertheless, the really sad thing is the weak Christian women who will now feel free to divorce their husbands. They have been taught by Christian media for decades that psychology is a true science. It is not just psychology that the Devil is using to tempt women to destroy their families. The entire legal system in America can be blamed for ripping up a myriad of wholesome families. The Devil has used these courts to appease the fickle emotions of many childish, ignorant women and has thereby launched countless children into a world of promiscuity. It is true that men can destroy families in selfish lust. Yet, in the majority of cases women are the one's seduced by the Devil through the bait of an unjust court system. A recent article in Insight magazine documents this truth: "Massive numbers of fathers who are accused of no wrongdoing now are separated from their children, plundered for everything they have, publicly vilified and incarcerated without trial. . . About 24 million American children live in homes where the father is not present, with devastating consequences for both the children and society...Conventional wisdom assumes that the fathers of these children have abandoned them. In this case the conventional wisdom is dangerously wrong. It is far more likely that an 'absent' father is forced away rather than leaving voluntarily. . . In his new study, Divorced Dads: Shattering the Myths, Sanford Braver of Arizona State University has shown conclusively that the so-called 'deadbeat dad,' one who deserts his children and evades child support, 'does not exist in significant numbers.' Braver confirms that, contrary to popular belief, at least two-thirds of divorces are filed by mothers, who have virtual certainty of getting the children and a huge portion of the fathers' income, regardless of any fault on their part. The title of Ashton Applewhite's 1997 book says it succinctly: Cutting Loose: Why Women Who End Their Marriages Do So Well. . . Other studies have found even higher percentages of divorces filed by mothers, and lawyers report that, when children are involved, divorce is the initiative of the mother in virtually all instances...Yet the voices of these fathers rarely are heard in the public arena. Instead we hear the imprecations of a government conducting what may be the most massive witch-hunt in this country's history. . .Under the guise of pursuing deadbeat dads, we now are seeing mass incarcerations without trial, without charge and without counsel, while the media and civil libertarians look the other way. . .families are being taken over by a destructive and dangerous machine consisting of judges, lawyers, psychotherapists, social workers, bureaucrats and women's groups -- all of whom have a direct financial interest in separating as many children from their fathers as possible, vilifying and plundering the fathers and turning them into criminals. The machine is so riddled with conflicts of interest that it is little less than a system of organized crime...In short, child support is the financial fuel of the divorce industry. It has very little to do with the needs of children and everything to do with the power and profit of large numbers of adults." (Published Date July 9, 1999, in Washington, D.C., www.insightmag.com) What is the main reason many women take the Satanic bait and destroy their families? Insight states: "...few of these divorces involve grounds such as desertion, adultery or violence. The most frequent reasons given are 'growing apart' or 'not feeling loved or appreciated.' (Surveys consistently show that fathers are much more likely than mothers to believe parents should remain married.)" "Growing apart"? "Not feeling loved or appreciated"? In other words, multitudes of women have the mentality of a worldly 8th grader with puppy love. How absolutely sickening it is that Christian women will destroy a family for such selfish reasons. Christian women must wake up and see what the Devil is doing. The Christian woman should always be on the defensive against Satanic attack. The Bible says in 1Pe 5:8 "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: " Women have known throughout the ages that this enemy is seeking the destruction of their families. They have had more power to fight these attacks in years past than they have now. Previous to this generation they have had "the strength of the vow." The Devil seeks to strip this from them. Our society has set the woman up for failure. It has taken away from her everything that could keep her strong as a "pillar" in her household. It has made her weak by centering all she stands for under the authority of her own feelings and emotions, instead of commitment, honor, and faithfulness. Women are now told by those who claim to have authority on the issue such as psychologists and counselors, Hollywood (and even some pastors) that she should stay married to her husband only as long as she feels herself to be in love with him. These false teachers are those that the Bible speaks of in 2 Timothy 3:6 "For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts." To base any decision on feelings is to set oneself up for a fall. God knew when He ordained marriage that the wife and husband would not always feel like they loved one another. He knew there would be "up" times as well as "down" times emotionally; that is why marriage should be a commitment. Jesus said in Matthew 19:6 "Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." This is how women can find strength in the vow she has made. Whatever emotions she and her husband pass through, it is of no consequence. She has committed herself, and that should be enough. Whenever feelings rise or fall, she, before God has told her husband and witnesses that she would love him as long as they both shall live. The world gives women an easy way out and tells her that as soon as her emotions fall, the marriage should end and she is even being hypocritical if she stays married: 2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; It is hoped that this article and the following excerpts will be of help to many Christian women, and that they will be encouraged to wake up and resist the Devil: Jay Adams, "The Christian Counselor's Manual": "Fundamentally, the problem of the first sin amounted to this: Adam and Eve opted for the satisfaction of desire rather than for obedience to the commandment of God. The devil appealed to 'the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life' (cf. 1 John 2:16 with Gen.3:6). Over against this was God's commandment: 'You shall not eat.' The options given to them are the same options that one faces now. They reflect two distinct moralities, two antithetical religions, and two discrete manners of life. The one says: 'I shall live according to feeling'; the other: 'I shall live as God says.'...When Adam sinned he was abandoning the commandment-oriented life of love for the feeling-oriented life of lust. There are only these two ways of life: the feeling-motivated life of sin oriented toward self, and the commandment-oriented life of holiness oriented toward God....They offer two different ways of handling life's problems: the one resorts to running, covering up, lying and blame-shifting, etc., while the other insists upon facing, confessing, speaking truth, and assuming responsibility...Until recently the former was present in Western culture, but the latter was the 'official' stance of most of the institutions of society and of culture. A reversal is now taking place in what has been called the rise of the new morality...It is a clever 'wile' of Satan to tempt men to think that they cannot do what God requires because they do not feel like doing it, or rather they must do what they feel like doing and cannot help themselves. Often the argument takes subtle forms, which at first seem plausible, even pious. For instance, a husband and wife may say, 'I guess there is nothing left to our marriage - no love - no feeling - nothing,' and thereby hope that the Christian counselor will concede that a divorce is allowable on other than Scriptural grounds. If they can get him to agree to this, they hope that their bad consciences over what they have already determined to do may be salved. They vainly look for balm in Gilead. But instead, the nouthetic [Bible only] counselor replies: 'I am sorry to hear that. I guess you will have to confess your sin and learn how to love one another, then.' Their reaction to this usually is sheer astonishment. 'But,' they protest, 'we told you that we don't feel anything for each other any more.' 'I understand, but that is irrelevant; God says that you must love one another. When you learn to do so, the feelings of love will follow. Love is not feeling first; it begins with obedient living.' 'What? Do you mean to say that we must try to love one another contrary to all of our feelings?' 'Exactly!' 'But wouldn't that be hypocrisy?' 'No, that would be obedience to God, who has commanded: 'Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself...' 'Joe, God says that you are responsible to love Phyllis; love begins with the husband, whose love must reflect the love of Jesus Christ (1 John 4:19).'... '...we'll begin at the lowest level of all" 'Love your enemies' (Matt.22:39)! You see, there is no escape; God commands love, even toward an enemy. The two of you must repent of your sin and by the help of God learn to love each other, even if you begin by loving as enemies.' 'But how can I love an enemy?' 'As I said, love is not feeling first. Hollywood and the TV have taught us that fallacious doctrine. Christians must reject it. Love is not getting but rather is giving: 'God so loved the world that He gave...(John 3:16)...When you invest enough of yourself in another, you will feel what you wish for him: 'Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also' (Matt.6:21)... 'Well...perhaps; but it still seems hypocritical.' 'No, it is never hypocritical to obey God. you have fallen into a trap of the devil in thinking that it is. Every morning - contrary to my feelings (all of which encourage me to pull the covers over my head and go back to sleep) - I get up. Does that make me a hypocrite, then?' 'Well, I suppose if you went about bragging that you loved to get up in the morning.' 'Precisely! Now, if, as the Scriptures command, you give in concrete ways to your enemy (a cup of cold water or something to eat when he is hungry or thirsty); i.e., if you care for his needs, even though at first you don't feel like it, does that make you a hypocrite?'... Nothing short of commandment living (often in spite of feelings) can keep life stable. The peaks and troughs grow larger as they are allowed to become the life motivating force; however, on the other hand, they tend to flatten out as life becomes commandment oriented." "The Christian's Secret Of A Happy Life," Hannah W. Smith: "Now, God's invariable rule is faith first and feeling second, in everything; and it is striving against the inevitable when we seek to make it different. The way to meet this temptation, then, in reference to consecration, is simply to take God's side in the matter, and to put faith before feeling. Give yourself to the Lord definitely and fully, according to your present light, asking the Holy Spirit to show you all that is contrary to God, either in your heart or life...Your emotions may clamor against the surrender, but your will must hold firm. It is your purpose God looks at, not your feelings about that purpose, and your purpose, or will, is therefore the only thing you need attend to... When, then, this feeling of unreality or hypocrisy comes, do not be troubled by it. It is only in your emotions, and is not worth a moment's thought. Only see to it that your will is in God's hands; that your inward self is abandoned to His working; that your choice, your decision, is on His side; and there leave it." C.S. Lewis, "Mere Christianity": "...love in a Christian sense, does not mean an emotion. It is a state not of the feelings but of the will; that state of the will we have naturally about ourselves, and must learn to have about other people...For example, a doting mother may be tempted by natural affection to 'spoil' her child; that is, to gratify her own affectionate impulses at the expense of the child's real happiness later on...Do not waste time bothering whether you love your neighbour; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him...Consequently, though Christian charity sounds a very cold thing to people whose heads are full of sentimentality, and though it is quite distinct from affection, yet it leads to affection." C.S. Lewis, "The Four Loves": "Most of our ancestors were married off in early youth to partners chosen by parents on grounds that nothing to do with Eros [i.e. romantic love]...And they did right; honest Christian husbands and wives, obeying their fathers and mothers, discharging to one another their 'marriage debt,' and bringing up families in the fear of the Lord...The couple whose marriage will certainly be endangered...and possibly ruined, are those who have idolized Eros. They thought he had the power and truthfulness of a god. They had expected that mere feeling would do for them, and permanently, all that was necessary. When this expectation is disappointed they throw the blame on Eros or, usually, their partners...We must do the works of Eros when Eros is not present. This all good lovers know, though those who are not reflective or articulate will be able to express it only in a few conventional phrases about 'taking the rough along with the smooth,' not 'expecting too much',...and the like."

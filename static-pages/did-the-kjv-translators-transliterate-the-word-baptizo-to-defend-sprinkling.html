        <h1> DID THE KJV TRANSLATORS TRANSLITERATE THE WORD BAPTIZO TO DEFEND SPRINKLING?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Did the KJV Translators transliterate the word "baptizo" (instead of translate it) because they believed in "sprinkling" and wanted to hide the fact that it meant "to dip"?


It is commonly argued by those who wish to prove that the KJV has errors, that its translators would not translate "baptizo" (GK) but simply transliterated it as "baptize," etc. In other words, they wished to mask the fact that it meant to "dip" in order to encourage their view of baptism (which was supposedly sprinkling or something other than immersion; but I have not yet seen this proven to have been the case before the 1640's). Regardless, the following are reasons why this much repeated objection is unsound:

1. The word "baptism" was already an established ENGLISH word when the KJV was translated. This can be easily seen by checking the definition and quotes under "baptism" in the Oxford English Dictionary and other reference sources. Or one may notice Robert Cawdrey's English Dictionary of 1604 where the first definition for "baptize" is given as "dipping."

2. Nothing would have been lost or gained by translating the word to "dip." Webster lists six definitions of the word "dip," one being "to moisten"! True, the primary, most common definition of "dip" is "to plunge." Nevertheless, the point is that "baptize" meant "dip," and nothing would have been gained or lost with either word if the translators had been trying to hide something.

3. It is common sense that context is to guide one's understanding of which definition to give a word. One should always choose the most common, primary definition unless context determines otherwise. Since the primary definition of "baptize" at the time the KJV was translated was "dip," or "plunge," if the translators had wanted to be dishonest and crafty, they would have never allowed the following verses to be translated the way they were:

Matthew 3:6 And were baptized of him *in* Jordan, confessing their sins.
16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went *up* straightway *out of* the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

Acts 8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down *both into the water*, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

Indeed, the best way to have discouraged the taking of the word in its common definition would have been to change such words as "in" and "into," etc. Yet, the translators did not deceitfully change the context.

4. Deciding what English word to translate with involves more than just meanings. Baptism is now a word that immediately brings to mind a holy ordinance. It is more sacred than "dip" or "immerse," though it means the same.

5. Were Anabaptists around at the time the KJV was translated? What were they called? They were not called "Anaplungers"! The word "baptist" was already an established word. How absurd it would have been to give up the word "baptism" when translating the KJV! Two hundred years ago, Dr. George Campbell stated that he wanted to adopt the word "immerse" instead of "baptize," since it was obviously the meaning of that word. Yet, he confessed he was not about to do so since "baptism" had been so long in use! And this brings up one last thing. It is utter hypocrisy to use the word "baptism" or have BAPTIST as a church name and then sit in the pulpit and criticize the KJV translators for using "baptize" instead of "dip"! To be more consistent, such a Bible corrector should refer to himself as, "Pastor of the First DIP church"! (No pun intended...really.)

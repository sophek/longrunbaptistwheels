            "But God never said He would preserve His words for the last days through the KJV translators!"

God did say He would preserve them (Ps.12:6,7, Lk.21:33). The Bible shows that God preserves by "reviving" (2Kings 22:8, Ex.34:1, Jer.36). This supports the KJV Only position. The KJV is an act of God supernaturally reviving His words in the mainstream. On the other hand, the Bible never shows God preserving His words imperfectly through a multitude of imperfect copies. Where is such a verse? At least the KJV Onlyists can prove their view by observing how God has preserved His words throughout Scripture. Yet, KJV critics do not have any ground for their belief other than the worldly canons of textual criticism commonly applied to ordinary, human books.

        <h1> GOD WOULD NOT PRESERVE HIS WORDS BY CAUSING THE KING JAMES TRANSLATORS TO TRANSLATE CORRECTLY.</h1>

            "God would not preserve His words by causing the King James translators to translate correctly."

Who said He would not? Did He not use fallible men to write the Bible in the first place? Why would He not use fallible men to simply organize and preserve it? Unless God has stated that He would not one day preserve His words through the King James Bible, there is no argument against Him doing so. The only question is whether or not the KJV bears the supernatural marks of God's providence. The KJV critic may argue that it does not. Yet, he cannot argue this on the basis that God would never preserve His words through the KJV. The KJV critic may indeed deny that the KJV bears the supernatural marks of God's providence. But then again, the Deists denied that Christianity itself lacked such evidences!

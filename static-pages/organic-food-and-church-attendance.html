        <h1>ORGANIC FOOD AND CHURCH ATTENDANCE</h1>
        <div id="content">
            There are many important things we can do to promote physical health. For example, we can rejoice in the Lord (Prov.17:22). And we can be sure to thank God for our food (1 Timothy 4:3,4). Many overlook the fact that God said every creature is good IF it is received with thanksgiving. How often Christians tend to ignore the "IF'S" of Scripture! Maybe this is why many are unhealthy. They sit down to eat and forget to give thanks. But I am convinced there is also another reason that many people get sick too easily in these last days. I believe our immune system is weakened by the antibiotics and other chemicals in our food. After quite a bit of reading on the subject, I decided to test it by eating only organic in our home. Our immune systems appeared to immediately grow stronger once the daily dose of antibiotics and other chemicals were not invading our bodies. The Lord then moved to open up the doors for our family to eat this way without increasing our food budget.

The Bible teaches that we are to assemble ourselves together and exhort one another more and more as we see the day approaching:
<blockquote>Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</blockquote>
This "day" is the day of the Judgment Seat of Christ which occurs at the Lord's appearing. The Bible predicts that times will grow increasingly perilous as the Second Coming draws nearer (2 Timothy 3:1). We should certainly gather together morning and evening on the Lord's Day. But we also need a mid-week time to gather together to refresh ourselves in Christ. In between these times, any small gatherings for soul winning, prayer, etc. are also helpful in keeping saints awake and on fire for God. It seems the Devil is doing all he can to keep Christians from getting this necessary fellowship in these last days. It is sometimes the Lord's will that a believer become temporarily sick as either a chastisement or a testing (1 Corinthians 11:30, Job 2:7). Yet, sometimes Christians are sick contrary to the Lord's will. In other words, sometimes it is no more the Lord's will that a believer be sick, than it is the Lord's will that a believer sin. For example, the Lord no more desires a Christian to be sick from a hangover and miss church than He would desire him to get drunk to begin with! He often permits people to receive the fruit of their own ways:
<blockquote>Proverbs 5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Proverbs 14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways...</blockquote>
It is not always willful rebellion (i.e. gluttony, lust, intemperance, etc.) that causes Christians to be sick under the Lord's permissive will. Sometimes it is simply a lack of knowledge or information. For example, a young man (never trained by parents or school in basic nutrition) that eats nothing but junk-food-cinnamon-rolls for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a year, should not blame God if his immune system is weakened and he ends up terribly malnourished and afflicted! Along this line, I believe that the Devil is getting the best of many Christians today in the area of sickness. He perhaps brings a flu or a stomach virus into a church and it spreads like wildfire and wipes out one family after another for a week or so. This occurs again and again. It is true that many are too quick to lie in bed on the Lord's day and forsake church instead of missing work; however, many end up missing work and church. And the more they get sick, the more they are tempted to miss church instead of risk losing their jobs.

I do believe the Devil is indirectly behind this whole scheme. He knows that Christians do not need to miss church. It is dangerous in these last days. It is not just the preaching we need to hear. We also need the praise and worship. The joy of the Lord is our strength! We also need the refreshing and convicting power of the Holy Spirit as He is present in the assembly of believers. This is my theory. I have tested it extensively before presenting it to you. I have read about it over the years; but I was never willing to test it. It always seemed too difficult or expensive. But the Lord always helps us when we step out in faith. And I believe whether or not our families are continually sick IS an issue of faith.

I once read an older book called "The Poisons In Your Food" by William Longgood (1975). Back then he wrote:
<blockquote>"Feeding antibiotics and tranquilizers to other meat animals is practiced almost universally in this country. Chickens and turkeys are dipped in antibiotics to increase their shelf life; and only recently the FDA gave permission for antibiotics to be fed to milk cattle...The most powerful substance given to meat animals is the artificial sex hormone...High-level shots of antibiotics also are given to cattle for 'shipping fever.'...A scientific symposium held in 1967 estimated that more than 2.7 million pounds of antibiotic food supplements are used annually in the U.S. (New York Times). Several speakers at the symposium warned that the widespread use has led to increased resistance to the drugs...Antibiotics are given to dairy and beef cattle, poultry, lambs and swine; they are used to put on cheap weight, boost production, treat disease, prevent disease, and as a preservative; they are used on FRUITS and VEGETABLES to prevent blight and bacterial disease, and as 'medicine' for sick food plants...The 'Journal of the American Medical Association' assured its readers that when fowl was preserved in an antibiotic dip, cooking destroyed 'more than 99 per cent' of the drug. Stated another way, it might be said that even after cooking some residue remains...It is known that antibiotic residue has appeared in 5 to 12 per cent of all milk samples tested by the FDA."</blockquote>
That was then. But more recently, "The Washington Post" reported:
<blockquote>"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are common in American meat, and the microbes survive in the human intestine for a week or more, where they could potentially be the source of drug-resistant infections in people. Those are among the conclusions of three studies published in today's New England Journal of Medicine...Antibiotics are routinely given to chickens, pigs and cattle to prevent illness and to promote growth. The drugs are put in feed or water in concentrations below that used to treat infections. The practice, while commonplace, is controversial because it encourages the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. In 1998, the European Union prohibited the use of antibiotics as animal growth-promoters if the drugs are similar to ones used in human medicine. Numerous groups are pushing for a similar ban in the United States...The FDA is convinced there are risks posed by at least some agricultural use of antibiotics..."</blockquote>
The New York Times reported:
<blockquote>"Studies Find Resistant Bacteria in Meats - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are widespread in commercial meats and poultry and can be found in consumers' intestines, researchers are reporting. The findings suggest that many food-borne illnesses will not respond to the usual treatments, and that some cases may even resist all current drugs...The overuse of antibiotics in human medicine has also contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, experts say...This year, the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Mass., estimated that 26.6 million pounds of antibiotics are administered to animals each year, with only 2 million pounds used to treat active infections; the rest is used to prevent infection or promote growth. Three million pounds of antibiotics are used in people each year...The third study was conducted at Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, with 18 healthy volunteers. It was designed to test how well antibiotic-resistant bacteria from meat survive in the human digestive tract. Twelve volunteers ingested antibiotic-resistant organisms from chicken or pork, and six ate antibiotic-susceptible strains from chicken. Afterward, the same strains were isolated from the volunteers' stools for up to 14 days, indicating that both the antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible bacteria survived the trip through the digestive tract and were able to multiply there."</blockquote>
Aside from the fact that dangerous diseases may be spawned, what does it do to our immune system over time to continually ingest small amounts of antibiotics? Simply ask the doctor what it will do to our immune system to take a small amount of prescription antibiotics every day. It is obvious that it will weaken it! Complicating this problem of small amounts of antibiotics in our food, many doctors claim that antibiotics are over prescribed by their fellow physicians. Robert S. Medelsohn warns:
<blockquote>"Growing microbial resistance to antibiotics may ultimately set medical treatment back to the position it held before penicillin was introduced more than 40 years ago...Unless doctors change their behavior and become rational and cautious in the use of antibiotics, we may see the day against which one Nobel prizewinning scientist warned. Professor Walter Gilbert, a Harvard chemist, said, 'There may be a time down the road when 80 percent of infections will be resistant to all known antibiotics.' Why do so many doctors prescribe antibiotics for colds, influenza, and other viral conditions that these drugs won't cure? They tell each other that they do it because their patients want them to." ("How to Raise a Healthy Child...In Spite Of Your Doctor", 1984)</blockquote>
The best defense against infectious disease is to strengthen our own immune system. Diet is certainly important. The Bible warns against too much of even healthy sugar (Prov.25:16, 27). It warns against "excessive" (i.e. "riotous") meat eating (Prov.23:20). Yet, Jesus ate meat (Luke 22:8, John 21:12). Therefore, one of the main reasons for weakened immune systems is not that people are simply eating meat; it is the fact that they are eating foods (meat, fruits or vegetables) that contain antibiotics! If traces of antibiotics are showing up in our food, then this is the number one reason that the immune system of each person is growing increasingly susceptible to attack - increasing our dependence on more prescription antibiotics - which, in turn, promotes the whole cycle all over again. It is hard to completely break free by simply using herbs or colloidal silver to fight the next flu (although this certainly helps). The only way to build up the immune system (and thus completely break free from the Devils' trap) is to only eat food that is 100% organic - the way God made it - the way it was meant to be eaten. Without the small doses of antibiotics constantly assaulting us, the body begins (with exercise and a reasonably healthy diet) to grow stronger in fighting infections. And every time an infection is resisted, the immune system grows that much stronger. The greater number of people in our churches that eat this way, the more consistent the attendance will be. The more consistent the attendance, the more encouragement, conviction, warning, etc. people will have against sin in these perilous times (Hebrews 10:25). Some will claim that it is impossible to eat organically (i.e. the way all people ate food until modern times) unless one is rich. But this isn't exactly true. For those without the time or room to plant a garden or raise chickens, there is a "co-op" in or near almost every city. Organic food can be purchased in bulk at a very low price. The money saved in bulk foods will allow you to purchase meat from health food stores (if you cannot find an individual to purchase it from). Let it be noted that I am not calling for tougher government restrictions on our food supply. I am exhorting the PEOPLE (especially preachers, heads of households, etc.) to become more informed and involved in regard to what they eat, and to teach others. For if our immune systems are weakened, we will be unnecessarily sick and will not be able to attend church. If we continually miss church, we are in danger of becoming SPIRITUALLY anemic.

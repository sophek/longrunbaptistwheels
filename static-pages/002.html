Fathers Without Honor

Mal 1:6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?

This past Sunday many of us celebrated the one day in each year called Father's Day. My family celebrated it in honor of the father in our home. My two year old joyfully made my husband a little finger painting and couldn't hold the secret until the appointed time. We secretly had family pictures made to give him and also gave him his favorite treat. My children loved the opportunity to show how much they love their daddy.

The world seems to give this little token to fathers, yet without the real honor they deserve. They kind of give this day to them with a little snicker and grin behind their backs as one trying to humor another. Hollywood and the media constantly portray fathers who are "the leaders of their homes" as ignorant, foolish men, or else mean and abusive. The world just cannot understand what a real godly Christian father is all about. I am afraid that due to much worldly influence, Christian women have much lacking in the area of honoring the fathers of their children.

As a pastor's wife, ninety percent of the counseling I do is on marital issues. Most women have much to learn when it comes to being godly obedient wives for two main reasons. First, even if they were raised in Christian homes, their mothers did not instill in them the duty to serve their fathers with all their hearts. To obey their least command, to honor them implicitly, to anticipate their needs and comforts. When a girl is raised like this, she automatically transfers this devotion from her father to her husband. Mothers, what better gift can you give to your girls, and to their fathers and future husbands? Secondly, they are not raised with an understanding, constantly drilled into their heads and hearts, that they are to obey their husband in this same way. The world would hate with a black hatred the words I am writing here, but we are not of the world. We are of Jesus Christ, and have a different Spirit than they have.

In the above verse, God says in Malachi that fathers get honor, and since He is the Great Father, He should get honor from His people. But Sisters, when we disobey His Word, we ARE NOT honoring Him! When the Bible tells us to obey our husbands and we refuse to obey, or for children to obey their fathers and they refuse to obey due to our lack of teaching, we are dishonoring God. In this day, unlike in the day of Malachi, fathers don't even get honor.

Many women excuse themselves from the commandment to obey their husbands by pointing out that their husband has many failings. But if every husband made the excuse not to cherish his wife until she were perfect, there would be no cherishing. And if every wife would wait until her husband were fully worthy before she were to obey him, there would be no obedience. The Bible commands wives to obey their husbands because they are their husbands, not because they are everything the wife thinks they should be. It is a principal that we as wives live by, not a fleeting feeling, to obey when we want to or when it suits us.

Heb 12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

Do your children "give reverence" to their father? Do they talk back, disobey, and not honor him in their attitude? You may need to deeply look at your own attitude to your husband. Your children are going to follow your example towards him. Are you are rolling your eyes at his commands, sighing as if he were putting to great of burdens on your shoulders and speaking angrily or (God forbid!) yelling at your husband? If you are, your children are not getting the example they need of submission and authority, and will despise you, as well as your husband, as they grow older.

Your husband is worthy of the honor due him outlined in the Bible. He may fall short of the perfect husband and father in many areas, but Sisters, his position gives him this honor, and not his works. When you honor your husband as he should be honored, the Lord promises us that He will take care of your husband's shortcomings. Give your husband the greatest gift you can give him this week after Father's Day. Give him the honor of his family.

Stinging Nettle
Many times I will walk through my yard and think that I have been bitten by an ant, only to realize that I had only brushed up against a weed called "Stinging Nettle". And it does sting! But when dried, boiled, or made into a tea, it has many useful purposes.

Stinging Nettle has small hairs on its leaves that "sting" you when touched, but it looses this power soon after being picked. My husband and I have used this herb for several years. We have bought it in bulk and made teas and ground it to make capsules. We have also harvested it ourselves from our property.

Stinging Nettle is full of vitamins and minerals, and has been used for centuries to treat nasal and respiratory problems such as allergy symptoms and hay fever, runny nose, cough, whooping cough, chest congestion and asthma. We first started using it because it helped my husband greatly during "allergy season." I love to make it into a tea, and take it several times a day when suffering with any of these problems. It has a subtle flavor, and is great with honey and cream.

(Note: All herbs are powerful and must be used with wisdom! Please discuss them with your healthcare provider before use.)

Darren and Jane Purdy: Independent, fundamental Baptist Missionaries in the Fiji Islands

Darren and Jane, along with their 5 young children, have given up all to serve Jesus on the mission field. Please pray for them! Here is a little about Fiji and their mission there in Jane's own words.

"I never felt "called" to any specific ministry, and I certainly felt that after all I'd been through in my teen years the Lord could never use me in "full-time ministry". I did feel called to Darren, however! The Lord drew us
together, and it was his calling that brought me to Fiji! He knew he was going to Fiji as a missionary before we ever met, so I definitely didn't go into it blind. Naive, yes, but not blind! "[So far] we have started one church, Lighthouse Baptist in Nadi, which now has a national pastor. We have just started a new ministry, Lighthouse Baptist Mission, & when there are enough members to charter a church, we'll probably change the name. The major religions here are Methodism, Hinduism, Charismatics, Seventh Day, Mormons, & JW's. I try to minister to the ladies and single girls/teens in the church. I have them over as much as possible, and enjoy their company, and their questions! "By American standards, most people in this country live below poverty level, although they don't know it! If you visit Fiji, you'd think most people are above poverty level, because of the towns and cities. But most people don't live in town, and when you visit the villages and settlements, you find most live in tin houses or traditional woven houses. Most have piped water, but none have hot water, and few have indoor toilets. Most cook over open fires, usually outside. It sounds quite primitive, and I suppose by US standards it is, but when one gets used to it, it really isn't so primitive! We are blessed with a "normal" 3 bdrm house, the only amenity we do not have is hot water. We did install an instant water heater in the shower, because neither of us can bear cold showers, let alone the kids! I use a "hot pot" to heat water for washing dishes, etc. My hubby did recently bless me with a dryer, also, which is a HUGE blessing! I can't imagine how I would manage without one here. The average family in Fiji doesn't even have a washing machine--I'd be lost without mine! So, by Fiji standards, we are rich kepalongies! (white men). "I think we really "feel" the missing of our close friends the most. Where we are currently living, there are no other women for me to fellowship with, nor Christian men for my husband. There are people everywhere, but none that could come close to being what we know as a real friend. None that understand our culture, or know what Walmart or BestBuy is, or can relate to the places you've been, let alone be able to encourage you spiritually! That's probably where the greatest differences come in."

Recently a news article caught my attention. In China, for the first time, a woman has had a successful ovary transplant from an aborted baby girl. Godly men and women who have been fighting against abortion have predicted this type of thing for years, and people thought they were crazy. Well, here it is. Now that it has started, the harvesting of baby parts is going to only grow worse. Please pray!

Sour Cream

This recipe is so easy! The taste is wonderful, and perfect for toping potatoes, etc. and making your own dips. Pour 2 cups heavy whipping cream into a jar or air tight contianer. Add 2 Tbsp cultured buttermilk (1 Tbsp to every 1 cup cream) and stir or shake until mixed. Keep at room temperature for 24 hours. Now the cream is thick and sour! Chill before serving.

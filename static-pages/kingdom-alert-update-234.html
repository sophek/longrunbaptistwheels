HE-WOMEN WHO MUST RULE
***************************************

Isaiah 3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and WOMEN
RULE OVER THEM. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and
destroy the way of thy paths.
13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.

In the news, recently, was the story about a female, homosexual,
"reverend" of the United Methodist denomination. Her name is "Rev. Karen
Dammann." She has a man's haircut, she wears men's clothes, and she has
taken a man's office in her church; and, as if these things were not
enough, she also lives with a female "partner" in a "romantic"
relationship (putting it discreetly!).  The UMC denomination recently held
a trial in order to see if she had broken any rules for being a homosexual
"reverend." Incredibly, according to the UMC website, she has been
declared "NOT GUILTY":

"Jury Finds Dammann Not Guilty - After deliberating for a day and a half,
the 13-member jury of Pacific Northwest Conference clergy members found
their colleague, the Rev. Karen T. Dammann, not guilty of the charge of
'practices declared by the United Methodist Church to be incompatible with
Christian teachings.'...The jury chairperson, the Rev. Judy Schultz,
delivered the verdict. 'While sustaining the specification that Rev. Karen
Dammann IS a self-avowed practicing homosexual, we, the trial court, do
not find the evidence presented...to be clear and convincing that Karen
Dammann has engaged in any 'practices declared by the United Methodist
Church to be incompatible with Christian teachings,' she said. 'We cannot
sustain the charge.'"
(UMC.org, March 20, 2004)

Dammann's own church website rejoiced to hear the news of her acquittal.
The following note was posted after the verdict:

"It is fitting that the wonderful news of Rev. Karen Dammann's acquittal
of charges filed by Bishop Galvan would be made on the first day of
Spring. IT IS TRULY A TIME OF REBIRTH, not just for our earth, but for the
body of the United Methodist Church!....I arrived just as Bishop Grove was
lighting the 'trial candle' which symbolized our COMING INTO THE
LIGHT....The trial closed with a prayer and the hugs, tears, and moments
of joy began. About 20 minutes later, most of those present at the trial
gathered in the sanctuary of Bothell UMC, for a short service. The pastors
at Bothell UMC lead the congregation in a beautiful and appropriate
selection of hymns, readings from the bible and a lengthy time of
community prayer. The sentiments offered in the community prayer reflected
the hope, love, and wish for a church where INCLUSIVENESS would be
available for all. My own silent prayer was for a church that could accept
this day's decision with an open mind, open heart and open doors. All our
prayers are needed that all of us in the United Methodist church can find
the GRACE AND COMPASSION TO EMBRACE THE POSSIBILITIES OF THIS REBIRTH."
(Jeff Waymack, PMW-RMN Communications Coordinator)
 
These people write like Pagans! Perhaps they see this present time as the
dawning of the Age of Aquarius, where the "patriarchal" age is replaced by
feminine dominance in all walks of life (i.e. emotions and intuition over
reason and conviction, wives over husbands, complete with homosexual
perversion, cross-dressing, and women pastors, etc.). They call it "grace
and compassion." The Holy Bible calls it all PERILOUS!:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that IN THE LAST DAYS PERILOUS TIMES SHALL
COME...
4 Traitors, heady, HIGHMINDED, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
God;
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such
turn away.
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
SILLY WOMEN laden with sins, led away with divers lusts...

Jude 1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but LEFT THEIR
OWN HABITATION, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
the judgment of the great day.
8 LIKEWISE also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion,
and speak evil of dignities.

The United Methodist denomination officially began on April 23, 1968. It
grew out of the Methodist Episcopal denomination. In 1956, the Methodist
Episcopal organization voted to give women full clergy rights. Once the
foundational commandments forbidding women pastors have been removed, the
denominations are ripe for the next step in their race down to Hell:
ordaining HOMOSEXUAL, female pastors:

Psalms 11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

Once the churches allowed the societal and Biblical distinctions between
the sexes to be blurred (in the name of "grace and compassion," of
course!), and once they allowed outlandish women to rule the churches and
denominations (in the name of "grace and compassion," of course!), all the
Devil had to do was to huff and to puff, and to BLOW!!! - and the whole
edifice crumbles down into HOMOSEXUAL PAGANISM. Why? The foundations have
been destroyed! The righteous can frown, sigh, pull out their hair, tear
their clothes, put sackcloth on their heads, etc., but it will all be in
vain unless the FOUNDATIONS ARE RESTORED. The same "hermeneutical
approach" used to IGNORE the Biblical commands on women's silence in the
church, women's dress, women's place in the home and society, etc., is the
same "hermeneutical approach" used to IGNORE the commands concerning
homosexuality, etc. The homosexuals LEARNED it from the feminists:

"We must not ignore the context that Paul was writing in. You see, there
was a particular problem that Paul was addressing in Corinth. These
Corinthian women were getting out of hand. Plus, the best textual critics
doubt some of these readings. And there is some evidence that certain
sections have been interpolated. Furthermore, aside from these arguments,
we must understand the culture of that period, and we must be careful
about rashly applying certain words of Paul to our modern situation, which
is entirely different. The question is, what would Paul have to say to us,
if he was addressing OUR particular situation? Would he not applaud
Christian feminism for its grace and compassion?"

I created and summarized the above rotten statement from reading stacks of
commentaries and feminist works. It all contains the same dung. Christian
feminists (and weak men who encourage or allow their rebellion) have begun
to bust up the Biblical foundation. Their "new hermeneutic" (i.e. vain
jangling) has removed the anchor of God's truth:

"Perhaps the most direct means Christian feminists have of defusing the
biblical passages that spell out the roles of men and women is to insist
that they were only intended for the first century....Sometimes the
apostle Paul is viewed by the Christian feminists as a theological
'schizophrenic'....They are calling for a development of a 'new
hermeneutic.'...they are open to whatever leads them to their foregone
conclusions...[Once] the ANCHOR of God's truth is gone...we are destined
to wander aimlessly on the turbulent seas of oppression, tyranny, error,
and darkness."
(David Enger, "The Gender Benders," 1981)

One may read Elizabeth Cady Stanton's openly, antichristian, 19th century
commentary called, "The Women's Bible," or one may read, "Woman Be
Free!"(1977), by Patricia Gundry, and one will see the same rebellious
spirit cloaked in a "form of godliness." Gundry writes:

"Some [of Paul's passages concerning women] present problems that perhaps
will only be solved when we talk to those to whom the letters were
originally written and they say, 'Oh, that refers to so-and-so and the
problem we had THEN. You wouldn't understand that unless you were there.'"

Yes, and after you have led Christian women into this Satanic rebellion
against plain Scripture, the homosexuals will be right behind you, USING
THE SAME ARGUMENTS! And this is exactly what is occurring in our day.
Notice one more example from Gundry's book. In the following words, she is
trying her hardest to get out from under Paul's clear prohibition on women
speaking in the assembly. She thinks she has found a way out:

"Most women at that time were not well-educated....So, rather than a rule
permanently sealing women's lips, this seems to be an exhortation to order
referring to a PARTICULAR abuse..." ("Woman Be Free!," 1977)

Gundry does not appear to have repented over the years, for she is
presently making this same book available online. She also does not seem
to realize that people like her (and especially the evangelical leaders
who supported and recommended her) are partly responsible for the present
homosexual crisis in the denominations. These homosexuals use the SAME
ARGUMENTS that the Christian feminists taught them to use. Their approach
to Scripture is also exactly the same: "Find every Bible passage on love
and compassion, etc., and recklessly use it to neutralize whatever else
you find in Scripture that is disagreeable to your preconceived
viewpoint."

For proof, notice the following words from Ann M. Amideo, in, "Romans
1:26-27: Did Paul Mean Homosexuality?":

"Sacred scripture is anchored in ancient cultures and deserves to be
accurately understood through a clear examination of the historical
circumstances which shaped them...An alternative approach to biblical
interpretation known as Fundamentalism has resurfaced in popularity among
certain Christian denominations....This results in a narrow point of view
that fails to consider the critical influences of political history,
cultural norms, translations and ancient literary forms....Already, church
history has conceded to a legacy of erroneous interpretations regarding
usury, slavery, war, and women....Romans 1 targets a SPECIFIC audience.
The text is directed at Gentiles who have willfully rejected the one true
God. Homosexuals, either Jewish or Christian are not addressed....Today,
homosexual persons are an active, vital force in the Christian
church....Homosexual men and women are involved in all levels of church
life and administration...."

And there you have it! When women leave their place (with Christian men
leading them and/or approving of them), every foul spirit, and every
unclean and hateful bird flocks to rush through the unholy crack in the
moral foundation! To try to fix the walls without fixing the foundation is
practically worthless.
 
Therefore, by God's grace and wisdom, let us lay again the foundation:

1 Timothy 2:11 Let the woman learn IN SILENCE with ALL SUBJECTION.
12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man,
but to be in silence.
13 FOR Adam was first formed, then Eve.
14 AND Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the
transgression.
15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in
faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

There are no "cultural" or "particular situations" given for this command.
It is rooted in both the ORDER OF CREATION, and the particular part the
woman played in the first Satanic deception in Genesis. Paul also gives
the same Spirit-inspired reasoning in 1 Corinthians 11, when discussing
the headship of the man:

1 Corinthians 11:8 FOR the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the
man.
 9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

He continues in 1 Corinthians 14:

1 Corinthians 14:34 Let your women KEEP SILENCE in the churches: for it is
not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under
obedience, as also saith the law.

Notice, this is no "cultural" restriction based on a particular situation.
He argues that the moral law of God revealed in the OT declares the same
truths (e.g. Genesis 3:16, Numbers 30:5-8, etc.)!

1 Corinthians 14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their
husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak IN THE CHURCH.
 
"Church" means the assembly of believers. It is the formal gathering
together of the saints of a local congregation. The first section of 1
Corinthians 11 dealing with women prophesying and praying says nothing
about "the church." There is no such phrases as, "in the church" (1
Corinthians 14:35), "when you are gathered together" (1 Corinthians 5:4),
"come together" (1 Corinthians 11:17), "come together in the church" (1
Corinthians 11:18), "come together therefore into one place" (1
Corinthians 11:20), etc. Christian women were free to publicly prophesy,
witness, edify, speak, and pray in their homes, and in non-church,
informal gatherings of individual Christians. Yet, in the mixed assembly
of the church, they are not permitted to even ask a question.

The Holy Ghost has foreseen the feminist rebellion in the final days, and
has therefore added words such as, "with all subjection" (1 Timothy 2:11)
to the command. Knowing that the cultural argument would be raised, the
Holy Ghost begins the section in 1 Corinthians with the following words:

1 Corinthians 14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace,
AS IN ALL THE CHURCHES OF THE SAINTS. (see also 1 Corinthians 1:2).

He then concludes 1 Corinthians 14 with the following words:

1 Corinthians 14:36 What? came the word of God out from you? or CAME IT
UNTO YOU ONLY?

And for those radical feminists who presumptuously claim, "I follow Jesus,
not Paul," the Holy Ghost had Paul write:
 
1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or
spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you ARE
THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD.
38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

Any man who disagrees with Paul on this subject is said by the Holy Ghost
to be "ignorant." He is ignorant because he is rebellious. He is ignorant
because he does not see that this rebellion in regard to plain
commandments concerning women will open the door to greater rebellion.
People will use the same excuses to justify even greater sins; and the
Christian feminists will not be able to rebuke them without hypocrisy.
Thus, the churches are practically silent today because they have dirty
hands. They cannot teach sinners GOD'S WAYS, because they have not been
following them. They have not repented of their OWN rebellion concerning
women in their homes and churches (Psalms 51:4, 13).

All rebellious women do not desire to look, dress or act like "Rev. Karen
Dammann." All do not desire to be a pastor. However, some rebellious women
seek to rule pastors (usually through their own husbands), and/or rule
their churches through fits, pouts, contentions, gossips, and other forms
of manipulation. The Holy Spirit has wisely instructed churches to keep
all doors for this manipulation closed. Thus, when many women are
subjected to voting quietly in mixed "business" meetings, and are unable
to give testimonies in the church assembly (which is easily turned into a
form of preaching), or to even ask questions in the assemblies (which can
easily be manipulated into a form of preaching), they will not approve of
it. They will protest by leaving in deep-rooted bitterness, and, as with
all bitter people, they will then seek to defile others with their
rebellion (disguised as "grace and compassion," of course):

Hebrews 12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God;
lest any ROOT OF BITTERNESS springing up trouble you, and THEREBY MANY be
defiled...

Christian women, give up this desire to control your husbands and control
your pastors. God did not call you to such a ministry. He did not call you
to continually take the temperature of your church, to nitpick and meddle,
and to give a weekly report to every member (leading to discouragement,
division, strife, etc.). If there is true Spiritual vision, let it shine
forth in a meek and quiet spirit, and a chaste conversation coupled with
fear. Let it shine forth in modesty, submission, shamefacedness and
sobriety. These are the feminine strengths God will be pleased to bless
and use. But backbiting, manipulation, insubordination, pouting, fits,
whispers, grumbling, murmuring, contentions, sighs, eye-rolling, frowning,
and a bad, rebellious attitude "descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
sensual, devilish." It divides families, just as much as it divides the
houses of the Lord (His churches):

Proverbs 21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with
a brawling woman in a wide house.

Proverbs 14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish
plucketh it down with her hands.
  
In conclusion, "he-women" who must rule, will pluck down their own houses,
and their own churches! And as sure as Eve felt she was "saving Adam from
oppression," these modern, BRAWLING daughters of Eve (and despisers of
Sarah's daughters) will not stay "planted" in their place, that they may
blossom with the true fruits of the Spirit.

LETTER FROM JAN COLSTON: VICTORY WON!
***********************************************
"I heard from my attorney this week. The Ft. Worth ISD has backed down and
will be giving me a letter acknowledging my right to be on the sidewalks
in front of the schools to give out literature. Praise the Lord! We just
can't give up our freedom to spread the gospel can we?!..." (Jan Colston)

Praise the Lord! Let all Christians and churches take advantage of this
wonderful opportunity to bring God's truth to the public schools!

QUESTIONS
**********************

WHAT IS THE STRONG DRINK IN DEUTERONOMY 14?

"Just a quick question. Something I cannot seem to understand here. I know
the Word tells us we should not use strong drink, and I believe that Jesus
didn't even make wine with alcohol, but what is Deut. 14:26 talking about?
It seems as though God is giving the ok for strong drink, even though it
is denounced other places in the scriptures...De 14:26
'And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,
for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for
whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy
God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household...' If you could
help me understand this, I would appreciate it." (Bro. David)

ANSWER: In regard to your question, this comes from the misunderstanding
concerning the phrase "strong drink." We naturally think of "strong" as
applying to the BITTER taste of fermentation, as in "whiskey" etc.
However, "strong drink" can actually be fermented OR unfermented (and is
used in both contexts, like the word "wine"), since the "strong" does not
refer to the BITTERNESS of alcohol, but to the RICH FLAVOR of the
substance. Notice:

Isaiah 24:9 They shall not drink wine with a song; STRONG DRINK SHALL BE
BITTER to them that drink it.
12 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
destruction.

In this verse, God is saying that because they are JUDGED, the "strong
drink" will be "bitter." This shows that it is not ordinarily bitter. It
actually refers to the RICHNESS of the drink. You will find somewhat the
same language today. A liquid is "weak" when it has been mixed with a lot
of water. Thus, in the grocery store, many will buy what they think is
"juice," but it is actually colored water with high fructose corn syrup
and artificial flavoring, and maybe a wee little bit of real juice.
Naturally, they sell this "weak" stuff really cheap. However, at a health
food store you will find the "strong drink." It is "strong" because it is
100% pure juice, with no added water. It will have sediment at the bottom
of the bottle. The "strong" refers to the richness of the taste and
flavor. This strong drink, even in our day sometimes contains alcohol (as
in orange juice and vodka, etc.). But it Deuteronomy 14, it is referring
to some rich, non-alcoholic substance that will bring true joy and health
to the body. It is not "raging," and it does not bite as a serpent!

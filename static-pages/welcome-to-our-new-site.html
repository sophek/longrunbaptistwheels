            Proverbs 14:26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence:
and his children shall have a place of refuge.

The local church is a hedge of protection. It should not be forsaken (Hebrews 10:25). It is the pillar and ground of the truth (1 Timothy 3:15). Kingdom Baptist Church strives to be a refuge where families and singles can be encouraged in the "old paths" (Jeremiah 6:16).  We have been blessed by a number of families who have relocated to be members of our growing church. We affirm the traditional, Biblical view of morality and the family. We also seek to maintain our premillennial, soul-winning, zeal for the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

We begin each Lord's Day at 11:30am. Come and stay for lunch afterwards! We have a 2nd, afternoon, service at 3:00, where we also enjoy songs from our children, etc.

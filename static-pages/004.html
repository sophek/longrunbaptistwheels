From Courtship to Marriage

Just a couple of months ago, I had the privilege and honor to behold the wedding of a young couple from my church. My husband performed the ceremony. It was beautiful and perfect in every way. How beautiful the bride looked as she walked down the isle to greet her groom! What a look in the eyes of the groom as he beheld her. We all knew that the Presence of the Lord was there as we witnessed the vows being exchanged. There was something different about this wedding than at most. As the groom took the hand of his bride to help her walk up the stairs leading to the stage, we all smiled, for this was only the second time he had ever held her had. The first time was at the wedding rehearsal. They took their first kiss together in the presence of the assembly, proclaiming their right to do so with the words "I now pronounce you man and wife." It was a wedding to be remembered. What was the difference in this couple? They courted.

Courtship is something that many will be surprised to hear about. Most think that it is a thing of the past. But far and wide, many Christians are again embracing this beautiful and pure way of allowing their sons and daughters to find their mates. Many parents are sick to death of the "dating" games that many Christians have taken upon themselves to participate in. In courting, the parents become what they should always be to their unmarried daughters: her protector. And why does she need protection from the sweet boy down the road? First, she needs protection emotionally. I know all too many girls who have done things they thought they never would have done due to an emotional attachment to a boy. In the book "Her Hand
in Marriage," Douglas Wilson says "& The modern recreational dating system encourages emotional attachments apart from the protections of a covenant fence. This has been accurately called emotional promiscuity. A man and a woman cannot function within a romantic relationship without becoming emotionally vulnerable to one another. Nothing is wrong with this vulnerability; it is just that we are delicate enough at this level to require protection before we enter into such a state, a protection which the Bible says is covenantal."

He goes on to say: "Moreover, the modern dating system also leaves the father of the young girl almost entirely out of the picture. The father, who ought to be protecting his daughter's sexual purity, sends her off into the dark with some highly-interested young man, and then does what he thinks is his job, which is to worry. `Well, dear,' he says to his wife, ` we can only pray. It has come to that.' And he should worry, because the modern dating system expects a certain amount of physical involvement."

Many Christians who have tried courting, or have seen it close up, will agree that this is certainly a blessed system. First of all, a young man must be truly interested in a girl in order to ask her father for permission to court. That requires a bit of boldness! Courting allows the whole family to become involved in the person. They all get to know each other as he comes over for dinner, family outings, games, or other activities. The boy and girl are at times left alone on the swing outside, or the living room in order to get to know one another better. They will be more able to know for sure if they want to become life long partners in these situations than they would roving all over town at midnight. Even if they are the strongest Christians, the temptations are high when left alone for hours. With courting, parents will have the blessing of participating in the continued purity of their daughter.

Though many may reject courting as being a thing of the past, it has definitely taken root in my heart and I have seen the testimony of its power in the lives of young people. My husband and I, as well as many parents in our church, have reserved our children for courting relationships alone.

Garlic Oil

Once, one of my daughters woke up in the middle of a cold winter night with a horrible earache. Having studied the uses of garlic oil, I had some on hand so I ran and got it from our cabinet. I put several drops in each of her ears, as she laid on each side in order to allow the garlic oil to get deeply into her ear canals. The pain was immediately soothed quite a bit so she was able to get back to sleep. For the next few days, I continued to put garlic oil in her ears every four hours. Even before those 3 days were over, all of her symptoms were gone! I personally think that one of the keys to using garlic oil is to catch an ear infection as quickly as possible. At times when my children have bad colds, I will apply the garlic oil in their ears even though there is no sign of ear infection. It sure beats rushing to the emergency room at 3:00 in the morning! Garlic has antibiotic and immune boosting benefits. Garlic oil will also treat a fungal ear infection as well or better than pharmaceutical drugs. I buy mine from the health food store. It is mixed with olive oil and goldenseal.

We use garlic whenever anyone in our family has a sickness. For years I was prone to get bronchitis and strep throat. I would go to the doctor, and they would of course prescribe antibiotics to me. When my husband and I found out about the dangers of [non-emergency] antibiotic use, we began to study alternative ways of treating these things, and found out about garlic. The next time I was sick, I chopped up a garlic clove every couple of hours and swallow it down like little pills. I praise the Lord that I have recovered every time, with only a trip to the grocery store, and a built up instead of worn down immune system! My husband also was very prone to strep throat and
has had repeated victory over it. Garlic is also useful for colds since it is antiviral as well as antibacterial.

Pancakes

For the flour, I grind Montana White whole wheat with my electric wheat grinder. Though in the past I have also used store bought whole wheat flour or unbleached white flour.
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 cup flour
Â½ teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder

-Beat the egg lightly and then add the milk. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Make sure your pan is already hot before pouring or spooning on the desired amount of the mix. I like to flip them when the bubbles just begin to break. Serve with plenty of butter and pure maple syrup!

Mimosa, By Amy Carmichael

This week I read a book that I wanted to share with you. A wonderful Christian worker and teacher to the young children in my church, whom we all call Miss Debra, asked me to read it. She said it was a life changing book, as she handed it to me with tears in her eyes. It was called "Mimosa," written by Amy Carmichael. Amy Carmichael, as many of you know, was a missionary to India. She started a school for children, and a rescue to children who were made to be (or about to become) temple prostitutes. She led many to the Lord, male and female, Hindu adults as well as children.

"Mimosa" is a true story about a little Hindu girl, only five years old, who on one occasion was able to visit Amy Carmichael's school called Dohnavur and hear about Jesus. No one there had the faith to even imagine what change took place in her little heart that one afternoon. Though she couldn't even remember Jesus' name, she left knowing that He loved her, and that He created all things. From that time on, she worshiped Him, and would no longer worship her family's god, Siva. She refused to put his ashes on her forehead, much to the anger of her family, and no beatings she received made her stop believing in the Lord. With absolutely no Christian friends, no Bible (she did not know how to read, even if she had one), and no teaching whatsoever, the Holy Spirit guided this girl all of her life. She was given in marriage to a Hindu man. When he was bit by a snake and was very ill, she wouldn't call upon the charmers to heal him. She knew her God would not be pleased, though all of the women of the village scorned her harshly. She overcame trial after heart wrenching trial, praying fervently on her knees and holding out her dress, or sari, out to the Lord in supplication. After having 5 boys, she was joyfully reunited with Amy Carmichael and Dohnavur. She sought them out trying to find a Christian place to raise her Children. Amy remembered her, and was amazed and filled with faith and joy to hear Mimosa's story of her faith to the Lord.

I just can't recommend this book highly enough! Never think that your witness for Jesus will come to nothing, because you never know what just one conversation can do in a person's life.

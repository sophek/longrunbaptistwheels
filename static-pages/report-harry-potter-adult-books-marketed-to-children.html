        <h1> REPORT: HARRY POTTER: ADULT BOOKS MARKETED TO CHILDREN?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "I do think that, on occasion, the material is not suitable for six-year-olds. But you can't stop them reading it. I read things when I was very young that disturbed me but I don't think that was a terribly bad thing. My parents never censored what I read so I wouldn't say don't read them to a six-year-old, just be aware some of it does get uncomfortable....If you are going to write about those kinds of things you have a moral obligation to show what that involves, not to prettify it or to minimise it." (BBC News, September 27, 2000) 

"One really great thing with my parents: nothing was off limits in my house...I was allowed to read anything I wanted." (Time, Oct.30, 2000, 
p.108) 

"[EW] 'There's some other horrific violence, too, like when Wormtail cuts up Harry's arm to get the blood to bring Voldemort back to life. Very disturbing.' 

[Rowling]: 'Yeah, that wasn't good, I agree with you.' 
[EW] 'Have you ever thought 'Maybe I should tone it down'? 

[Rowling]: 'No. I know that sounds kind of brutal but no, I haven't. The bottom line is, I have to write the story I want to write. I never wrote them with a focus group of 8 year olds in mind. I have to continue telling the story the way I want to tell it. I don't at all relish the idea of children in tears, and I absolutely don't deny it's frightening. But it's supposed to be frightening!'" (Entertainment Weekly, Sept. 7, 2000) 

Comments: Of course, even "adults" have no business reading these books which glorify sorcery. The Bible says, very literally, that sorcery will be revived before Jesus returns (Rev.18:23, 9:21). Sorcery is a denial of God. It is rebellion against Him. Why would Christians want their children "make believing" with evil powers the Bible says the Antichrist will LITERALLY use very soon (2 Thess.2:9)?

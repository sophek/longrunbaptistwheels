Greetings in Jesus!

On our web site, you can view our new video, "The Rise of the New Word Order, in History and Prophecy." Did you know there has been a "cult" of the New World Order for over 100 years? They call it an "open conspiracy." They do not try to hide it. They openly tell us how they plan to indoctrinate children concerning the New World Order. They warn that the American Constitution will cause them some temporary problems. They warn that many will resist this World Government. We cover a lot of material in this video, comparing their plans with current news. Check it out. The Bible is always right!

Also, our current video and audio messages on Ephesians 5 are online (along with the Virtuous Woman Series). This last week, we documented the mystical "War on Reason" (part 1). We also dealt with the Eastern Mystical "soaking prayer" that arose out of the "Toronto" Laughing movement. This coming Lord's Day (11:30, Texas time), Lord willing, we will show how Satan is attacking "rational thinking," and promoting mysticism through new versions. Watch us live, online, if you can!

REVIEW AND RESPONSE TO CHUCK AND NANCY MISSLER'S, "THE KINGDOM, POWER &amp; GLORY: THE OVERCOMER'S HANDBOOK (REVISED)" - PART 2
This book was first published in 2007, but was recently revised in October, 2009. This is the second part of my response to it.
In Chapter 2, Brother Missler rightly shows that man was created to reign on the earth with the King of kings. Missler then traces the fall of man and the plan of salvation offered through Jesus Christ. In explaining the meaning of salvation, however, he makes some foundational errors. He writes:
"Salvation then is a free gift that Christ wants everyone in the world to have. All that's needed is for us to believe in what Christ did on the Cross (for the redemption of all mankind) and choose to be obedient to His commandments."
Perhaps the above statements are the result of awkward wording. He appears to make salvation dependent upon belief and works. But the righteousness required by God for eternal salvation is absolute perfection. This is why God must give to believing sinners the free gift of His righteousness, through the Blood. But if salvation is by believing "and" keeping the commandments, every man will again fall short! Roman Catholics (see the Council of Trent) believe that salvation is through faith and works. The Bible, in contrast, teaches that salvation is through faith alone (see Romans 3 and 4).
But then Missler rightly adds:
"This simple act of belief is what makes one 'declared not guilty' (or justified) before God (Romans 3:26;4:5-6)."

Now we are back on track! Next, Missler writes:

"By accepting what Christ has done for us on the Cross, five things occur: 1) we are set free from our bonds of sin..., 2) we are delivered from the penalty of death, 3) we are guaranteed an entrance to the Millennial Kingdom (and to heaven)..."

Where is the proof for his third point? Affirming something does not make it so. I showed in detail in the first part of this review that the Bible teaches that entrance into the Millennial Kingdom is not guaranteed to every believer (e.g. Matthew 5:19-20, 30; 18:3, 8; Mark 9:47; Hebrews 4:1, etc.). The word "kingdom" in the Bible often refers to the Millennium or temporary kingdom (1 Corinthians 15:24-25). And this kingdom is a reward for faithfulness (2 Thessalonians 1:5; 2 Timothy 2:12, etc.). It is a great error to make this blessing an unconditional gift of grace, regardless of faithfulness in the life of believers.

In discussing Justification, Missler writes:

"Being justified also means that we are guaranteed an entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven..."

Where does this Bible teach this? Missler is wrongly using the phrase "Kingdom of Heaven" as a synonym for Heaven. But this kingdom is not Heaven. It is the kingdom "of" Heaven. It is the Kingdom that Heaven (God's throne or place of authority) will establish on earth at the Second Coming (Daniel 2:44). It is no more in "Heaven" than John's baptism was "in" Heaven, when it was said to be "from" Heaven (Matthew 21:25). The Kingdom of Heaven is the Kingdom that Heaven authorizes (in contrast to the kingdoms of this world) on this earth, when Christ returns to reign:

Matthew 8:11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.

These Gentiles do not come from the east and west in outer space, to sit down in Heaven above! They come from the east and west of this earth, to sit down in the Millennial Kingdom, "under" Heaven (Daniel 7:27).

Likewise, the Kingdom of Heaven is conditioned upon believers showing mercy to others:

Matthew 18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. 35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

It is conditioned upon faithfulness in Matthew 25, in the Parable of the Ten Virgins, and in the Parable of the Talents:

Matthew 25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

Eternal salvation (eternal security) is not conditioned upon these things. These (and many other) reasons show that is wrong to teach that entrance into the Millennial Kingdom is guaranteed to every believer, regardless of his or her faithfulness; and it is wrong to confuse the Kingdom of Heaven with Heaven or eternal, positional justification.

Missler then states that the "soul" is the realm of emotions, desires and thoughts. I believe (along with many other writers, such as Ironside, F.W. Grant, etc.), that the "spirit" of man is the realm of reason and rational thinking (1 Corinthians 2:11). The "soul" is often the realm of the desires and emotions (Psalms 34:2, Proverbs 13:4, etc.).

Missler then states that the "spirit" is already saved, but our soul is in the process of being saved. However, the Bible teaches that the spirit, soul and body of every believer are already saved eternally. This salvation is not yet fully experienced; but it is possessed and guaranteed. Therefore, it is not just the soul that is in the process of "being saved" as we yield to God (in relation to the Judgment Seat of Christ). Notice the "spirit" is also liable to corruption and needs to be renewed daily:

2 Corinthians 7:1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

Notice, the "spirit" of believers (their minds) needs to be cleansed, just as their bodies need to be preserved in moral purity. Notice another verse:

1 Thessalonians 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

This is a prayer of Paul for these Thessalonians. Notice, they are not only liable to physical blame in relation to their bodies; their spirits and souls are also liable to become defiled and blameworthy. Therefore, believers are to strive to maintain physical, mental and emotional purity. Our emotions and desires (soul) are not as easily controlled as our rational thoughts. But our affections can be set on the things of God, indirectly, by what we think and do (Luke 1:46-47).

The spirit of every believer is saved eternally. It possesses the light of the Gospel, etc. But the body , soul and spirit of every believer need to be saved at the Judgment Seat of Christ in relation to the Millennial Kingdom:

1 Corinthians 5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

This man's spirit is already saved in the Eternal Kingdom (at the Great White Throne). He is a believer (5:11-13). But it is not saved automatically into the Millennial Kingdom. Disobedient believers (who commit gross sins) should be excluded from the local body, so they may be ashamed, and chastened, and will hopefully repent and seek forgiveness with God and the church they offended (2 Corinthians 2:5-9).

Although there is much good in this chapter, Missler continues to make the same mistake concerning the Millennial Kingdom:

"Justification is what gets us into the Millennial Kingdom and heaven."

Although this is wrong, Missler does get close when he defines (practical) sanctification:

"It's the means God uses to make us partakers of His life so that we can become those overcomers who inherit the Millennial Kingdom...Ruling and reigning with Christ is the mark or goal of the high calling of Christ..."

But then he misses it again:

"Unfaithful, disobedient, and unsanctified believers (the overtaken) will enter that kingdom, but forfeit the privilege of having levels of responsibility there."

No, the idea that believers of this age can enter the Millennium and not possess any authority there, is a fable. Every believer who enters the Millennium will be faithful and chosen, and will reign as kings (Revelation 5:10, 17:14, 19:14, 20:6). They will all reign to some degree. Their differing levels of authority (such as ten cities or five cities, Luke 19) will be based on the degree of attention they give to the least of the commandments (Matthew 5:19). They are obeying the greater or big commandments to the degree that believers can obey them (i.e. they are not committing exclusion sins, or failing to repent of these sins). Their faithfulness to the details or "little things" will determine how high they reign in the Millennium.

But Missler has all believers entering the Millennium, even if they are unfaithful in larger things, contrary to 1 Corinthians 6 and Galatians 5, which teach that the kingdom itself (as the inheritance!) can be lost by sin.

Missler next deals with eternal security and provides some great paragraphs. But then there is a big problem when he defines Arminianism:

"..they will lose their salvation and, again, be unable to participate in the Millennial reign. Theologically, this is part of what is called Arminianism. In this study we want to present a third and what we think is a very provocative way of looking at these things...This might be called the 'Overcomer's Viewpoint.'"

After dealing with Calvinism and the false-professor view, Missler deals with Arminianism, as seen above. He then offers the "third option," which is his view. But Arminians not only teach that the Millennial reign can be lost; they also teach that eternal life in the Eternal Kingdom can be lost. But Missler fails to mention the multitudes of Christians who taught that the Millennial Kingdom could be forfeited, while nevertheless holding to the doctrine of eternal security. These Christians are wrongly identified with the Arminians by Missler (or at least it is implied). Yet, the classic "overcomer" view consisted of this doctrine (not Missler's). Men like Govett, Pember, Poynder, Tilney, Kethcham, Fry, Nee, Rader, Panton, Sladen, Craig, and scores of other writers documented in my book, were advocates of Millennial exclusion. In fact, the whole "third option" between Calvinism and Arminianism was classically and historically rooted in Millennial exclusion. On the other hand, the view advocated by Missler (and Dillow, etc.) has little historical fruit. Of course, we do not base what we believe on men; but it is not unreasonable to doubt any doctrine that is found primarily in these Laodicean times, when the Bible warns that so many will not fear God or endure sound doctrine.

Next, Missler deals specifically with a question concerning the Millennium:

"The question then becomes: What happens to these 'carnal, backsliding, nominal' believers in the Millennium?...If we don't learn sanctification here on earth, we will run the risk of jeopardizing our place and our position in the coming kingdom...we will be a part of the Millennium...But, if we don't learn holiness here, we will forfeit the possibility of ruling and reigning with Him there."

This is certainly, partly true. But again, Missler does not realize that when a believer is excluded from reigning, he is likewise excluded from entering the kingdom. Every believer who enters this kingdom from this age is a king. He is faithful and chosen and holy (Revelation 5:10, 17:14, 20:6). There are degrees of authority (ten cities or five cities, etc., as in Luke 19). This authority is given as a reward for diligent attention to the least of the commandments (details), as described in Matthew 5:19. If the believer who breaks the least of the commandments is least in the kingdom, where is there any room for the person who breaks the greater commandments? They do not inherit the kingdom at all. They are excluded. They do not enter. They are beaten with stripes (Luke 12). Missler continues:

"The question at hand is: Where will we spend our Millennial Kingdom days? Will we be rejoicing and fellowshipping with each other in the presence of the King of kings, or will we be in some other separate  region or 'separate place' experiencing profound regret and remorse as we look back on a life full of opportunities?"

In spite of multitudes of Scriptures which warn believers of hell (such as Matthew 5:22, 29-30, 10:28, 18:8-9, 35, Mark 9:43-47, Luke 12:5, etc.), advocates of Missler's view still maintain that unfaithful believers must go to some mysterious, unidentified place in the kingdom! But if these Scriptures I mentioned above do not apply to true believers (as addressed), then the whole "over-comer" viewpoint breaks down. In other words, it is unreasonable to apply scores of warnings to true believers, but then adopt the Calvinism system when the warning gets too hot, or too descriptive!

It is one thing to attempt to answer questions too high for us. But it is another thing to ignore the Lord's plain revelations. There are many Scriptures that not only warn believers of kingdom exclusion (or make entrance conditional upon faithfulness), but also specify where the excluded will spend the duration of the Millennium. We see in Revelation 20:13 that everyone comes out of "hell" at the Great white Throne (last day). Then, unbelievers go into the final Lake of Fire, and believers enter the Eternal Kingdom, where their tears are wiped away and there is no more death or even pain (Revelation 20:15, 21:4).

I do wonder why "regret" is so greatly emphasized in Missler's system, when the Lord only lists it as one of the things unfaithful believers will experience:

Matthew 24:50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Weeping is only one of the warnings. Is this weeping literal? Certainly it is. But then why are the first warnings the Lord gives ignored? There is a cutting asunder and an appointment with the hypocrites. Certainly these must be as literal as the weeping in the same verse!

Why is there such an emphasis on regret and remorse? Why don't our earthly courts punish people with only remorse? Why doesn't God only use regret today when chastening believers? Why does He sometimes use weakness, and sickness, and even death (1 Corinthians 10 and 11)? This age is the age of the Lord's patience, yet the Lord uses more than regret and remorse as punishments. It is very unreasonable to conclude that the Lord will therefore only use regret when He comes in the day of judgment according to works! The man in Corinth certainly experienced sorrow (2 Corinthians 2:7). But was he not also excluded (1 Corinthians 5:13)? Where does the Bible teach that remorse and regret are the only punishments that unfaithful believers will experience when the Lord finally returns in the day of His judgment? Surely, unfaithful believers will receive exactly what Jesus warns they will receive. And these warnings are just as literal as His promised awards. In fact, they are so literal and terrifying that multitudes of Christians are embarrassed by them. They are ashamed to confess them before men (Mark 8:38). But the Lord knows that His people need these warnings. And we have no right to lean to our own understanding, or be influenced by this psychological, feminist age concerning them.

As Missler's second chapter winds down, he has a section on chastisement. He writes:

"Please hear this loud and clear! God does not punish us, He simply disciplines us...'To punish' means 'to inflict harm'; whereas 'to chasten' means 'something that us done for our profit...'"

I wrote a whole book on this subject, and provided many Scriptures and word definitions that refute Missler's view above. Both the Bible and the English language are against Missler's words. In fact, the word "chastise" sometimes certainly involves harm. These words (punish and chasten) are synonymous:

Chastise: "To correct by punishing; to punish; to inflict pain by stripes..." (Webster's, 1828)

Leviticus 26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.

Deuteronomy 22:17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

1 Kings 12:11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

Luke 23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

2 Samuel 7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:

Psalms 38:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

1 Corinthians 11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

These verses show that "chastisement" can mean beatings, and even death. Likewise, believers can be "punished" now, and when the Lord returns:

2 Corinthians 2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.

Hebrews 10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?

Restoration and reformation are certainly some of the Lord's purposes for chastisement. But it is humanistic to conclude that retribution and vengeance are not included in the Lord's purposes. He warns believers of vengeance and retribution:

1 Thessalonians 4:6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

Hebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

I believe Missler would rightly apply the above verses to true believers. And they prove that retribution is included in the Lord's purposes for punishing His people.

Missler does include a great point in this section:

"As we'll see, discipline begins in this lifetime and probably will continue on into the next!"

This is certainly true. We simply need to define this discipline as the Lord defines it:

Luke 12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

Missler, again, rightly adds:

"...after our initial conversion (justification), God deals with us on an entirely different plane. He now deals with us as 'servants' with a view toward the Millennium."

This is a good and important point, as the New Testament reveals:

1 Peter 2:16...as the servants of God.

Philippians 1:1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ...

He concludes this chapter with some great testimonies, and he writes:

"Passages of Scripture that you have known and studied for years will come into a whole new light. They will literally jump off the page as being Millennial."

Amen and Amen! He is on the right course. I believe that he simply needs greater consistency and literalness in applying the various warnings to believers, just as he rightly and literally applies the awards. Indeed, many will mock; but multitudes will also awake like never before. And most of all, we will be faithful to the words of Jesus, by not taking away from His warnings:

Revelation 22:19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

Revelation 3:5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

Luke 9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

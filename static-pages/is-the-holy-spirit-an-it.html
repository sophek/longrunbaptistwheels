        <h1>IS THE HOLY SPIRIT AN IT?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Scholars who advocate the use of new bible versions often rebuke the KJV for referring to the Holy Spirit as an "it". For example, in John 1:32 the KJV says:

Joh 1:32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

Notice it says "it" abode upon Him. This is supposed to shock the Christian into buying an NAS. (The NAS calls the Spirit a "He" in Jn.1:32). The scholar then tells the Christian how terrible "IT" is to refer to God as an "it".

The KJV is not bound by many of the narrow rules of grammar that men came up with in later generations. Even today, one may go to the home of any KJV rejecting scholar and knock on his door. Unless he is wise to your game, he will immediately answer, "Who is IT?" You can then answer, "IT is I". Doesn't he know that "it" is only to be applied to non-personal things? Let the reader notice that the new bibles often forget their rule. First notice the KJV:

Mt 14:26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. 28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.

"IT" is in all three verses. Notice the NAS:

Matthew 14: [26] And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were frightened, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear. [27] But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid." [28] And Peter answered Him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."

Again, "it" is found in all three verses.

The NIV also dares to call a child an "it":

Revelation 12: [4] His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment *it* was born.

Conclusion? Keep reading your KJV. It shows you in abundantly, in many places that the Spirit is God and not an impersonal thing.

THE ROD: WILL GOD SPARE IT?
-Reviews and Foreword
-CHAPTER 1 [without footnotes]
===============================

Reviews:
"Pastor Faust has scoured the entire Bible to answer a question seldom asked or faced. Will there be a judgment of believers at the Bema Seat of Christ as Paul points out in 2 Cor. Five. He has come to the conclusion there will be a judgment and some will be rewarded with millennial blessings. Others will be rejected. He has also scoured the works of many devout Bible scholars and found that they have come to the same conclusion and provided us with their names, works and actual quotations to substantiate their views. Many pastors will reject this book for they do not expect their ministries to be tried. They will not recommend the book, for so long they have pampered their members into continuing lethargy and laxity in Christian living. A few will awake and get ready for the Bema Seat."

"In this day and age I see many people who claim to be born again, washed in the blood, and serving Jesus spending a great deal of their time living the way they want to because, after all, they are 'once saved always saved' etc. I know that in its simple form the Bible says born again, and you can not be unborn, therefore I know the Bible teaches the security of the believer. It just so happens that my Southern Baptist denomination believes in the security of the believer, and I am proud of them. I know at this point many of my brothers and sisters will feel I have left the bus, but I agree with the teaching that Brother Faust has brought to the surface, after it was left in the dust. His book brings together what has been in the history of the church for years. If this teaching is wrong, it could possibly bring some minor blips of argument. But if on the other hand it is right, and I believe it is, then those who will be under the Rod will wish that they had read this book more closely. n short, I believe if this truth is taught, God's people will wake up and start living like Jesus wants them to live. I for one will do everything I can to apply this truth to my life, my ministry, and with anyone who will listen. I am reminded when the people of old in Scripture were building great buildings, the Word pointed out that the Word of God had been lost in the dust. Only after this truth comes forth will we see real Revival. Praise God for a young man like Brother Faust, who has brought us back to the roots of the true teachings of the Bible, even if it runs against 'church' tradition. Notice the little c, real 'Church' history is what this book is pointing out to each of us. My conclusion after searching the Bible with this book in hand is, God will not spare the Rod, and to do so would be contrary to His Holy nature."

"In this day and age of 'dumb dog' preachers (Isaiah 56:10-11) who have avoided preaching the second coming and the Judgment Seat of Christ as though doing so would invite the Bubonic Plague, Joey Faust, who refuses to be snared by the 'fear of man' (Proverbs 29:25), is a lone voice crying in the wilderness, warning the people of God to repent for the Lord comes quickly bringing his reward with Him (Revelation 22:12). I wholeheartedly recommend this volume to anyone with the courage to read it. May God grant you a pure heart and an open mind as you read."
-Edward R. DeVries, Th.D., President, School of Biblical &amp; Theological Studies

"Joey Faust has done a remarkable job of researching a crucial doctrine for the church-rewards and their loss. Too many believ-ers have, unfortunately, never been taught that salvation is by grace, but that rewards are earned. In this well researched book Joey reminds us of this doctrine and the pastors and theologians who have challenged believers throughout the centuries with these truths. The truths of the judgment seat of Christ are often ignored, but in these pages we face the reality of rewards for winner believers and the loss for those who fail to live the Christian life."
-Rev. Robert Dean, Jr., ThM. M.A., Dallas Theological Seminary

"The Rod: Will God Spare It? is not a fresh challenge to contem-porary liberal theology, but a historical and Biblical approach to doctrine that is too often ignored. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God has been torn from too many Bibles by Christians that refuse the truth. Yet the day is fast approaching Christians will come face to face with the terror of the Lord. Today's Christianity tries to teach that all Christians will receive great reward just for the obedience of the cross. That reward be-longs to the one that was obedient, the Lord Jesus Christ. If we come to Christ but go no further, we will stand in judgment before Him at the judgment seat of Christ. It clearly states that the white raiment given to the bride of Christ is the righteousness of the saints - not the righteousness of Christ. Too many have been lured into complacency and even sleep by liberal theology and believe heresies that there is no coming judgment for the Christian. Yet judgment has always begun at the house of God. Pastor Faust has presented a viewpoint well researched historically and supported with Scripture to show there is a coming judgment for Christians. Each and every one that names the name of Christ would do well to take heed of what has been written in Pastor Faust's book and make themselves ready." -John Melancon, ThM, Missionary to Cortez, Colorado

"Time does not permit the amount of study that it would require to agree to all of the conclusions of the book The Rod: Will God Spare It? by Pastor Joey Faust. However this well written and meticulously researched book will no doubt become one of the most controversial works in this generation. If it does nothing else but to elevate the near forgotten doctrine of the Judgment Seat of Christ to a worldly church that has "no fear of God before their eyes," then it no doubt will serve an important purpose." -Dr. Greg Dixon, Pastor Emeritus Indianapolis Baptist Temple

"Joey Faust clearly lays out Biblical truths which are so vital for an overcoming Christian life but which are not being taught in churches today. As a result, people wrongly believe that these truths have never been taught in the church. Faust not only lets the Bible speak for itself, but through an incredible amount of research, he also substantiates that these truths have been held and taught throughout church history. The research in this book is without equal and an invaluable tool for setting the record straight so that Christians will not be walking blindly into the judgment seat of Christ."
-Pastor Donald W. Gilmour III, ThM., Dallas Theological Seminary

FOREWORD

Before we get into the meat of this study, it is interesting to note that Charles H. Spurgeon had kind things to say about Robert Govett, whom Joey Faust often quotes. While not making any public defense of kingdom-accountability, he felt that Robert Govett's teaching "will be more appreciated by future genera-tions than by this frivolous age." It is hard to define the present age as being less frivolous than Victorian England but even in these days the Holy Spirit is moving among God's people to have a serious re-think about some Bible warnings that have not been popular. The Rod: Will God Spare It? was not written to win a popularity contest. Absorbing the truths written will often cause a ripping away of old ideas which have become iron-clad interpretations of scripture. It is my prayer that a serious study of this book will help many Christians to fully understand that rewards for some means loss of rewards for others, and the result will be more overcoming Christian lives in this needy century. I trust there will be those who are spiritual enough to desire the truth, astute enough to grasp the truth and brave enough to pro-claim the truth. Teachers must be warned, however, that these truths require a great deal of foundational teaching to be done so that Christians will be able to understand what Pastor Faust is saying. One early criticism I received was that accountability teaching uses the same scriptures and tactics as do those who do not believe in eternal security. For this reason, I am glad that throughout the book, and especially in the early chapters, the truth of justification and eternal life based only on the merit of Jesus Christ is emphasized. Another brother thought the teaching sounded like Roman Catholic Purgatory, but Pastor Faust has dealt with this problem thoroughly. Almost every Christian has some idea of the fact that he will appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ to receive rewards. Few Christians realize that "wood, hay and stubble" Christians will not only lose a reward, they may lose the glorious inheritance of millennial reign with Christ. Pastor Faust introduces much scripture concerning this, and the book abounds in quotes from outstanding men of God. Many Fundamental Bible teachers of the nineteenth and early twentieth century taught this. It will no doubt be that some will shudder when they think of how dreadful the punishment might be because they have been taught that all the warning passages of the New Testament apply only to unbelievers. They have, for instance, thought that the ten talent servant and the five talent servant were both Christians, but the one talent servant must be an unbeliever because of his punishment. The Judgment Seat of Christ is coupled with "the terror of the Lord" in Second Corinthians 5, even though Scofield has helped us to classify the Hebrews 6 partakers (Gr: associates) of the Holy Ghost as unbelievers because "their end is to be burned."
Few studies have been able to accept such a Biblically-mandated punishment and still maintain the essential doctrine of the security of the believer. Pastor Faust presents a solution which may not be popular or ear-tickling, but is thoroughly grounded in Bible truth. 21st century Christianity should be thankful that God has raised up a man to write of these things. You may not be able to grasp or believe all that is written, immediately, but you are asked to act like true Bereans, and search the scriptures to see if these things be so. Having heard these truths, you will be accosted by them at the Bema Judgment Seat (Luke 12:47). May we all be true overcomers and partake of the pure joy that will come to us and to our Savior when He says, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."

CHAPTER 1 - THE ACCOUNTABILITY AWAKENING
*************************************************
â€œThe native magnitude of this [kingdom-accountability] truth must speedily redeem it from all obscurityâ€¦This doctrine so potently contends against the selfishness and laxity of believers in this latter day, that no one who considers the matter can expect that its career will be otherwise than stormyâ€¦those who have the single eye will perceive its amplitude of evidence, and embrace it, in spite of the solemn awe of God which it produces, and the depth of our own personal responsibility which it discloses.â€
-Robert Govett (1813-1902)

â€œ...a host of living expositors of Scripture [are embracing kingdom-accountability truth], a host which is increasing all the time.â€
-William P. Clark (1864-1953)

â€œWe are glad to be counted amongst the rapidly growing number of writers who are doing pioneer work in teaching the Scriptural, searching message of a deeper Personal Responsibilityâ€¦Forever suppressed these truths will not be - The Holy Ghost is pressing them even now upon believers everywhere.â€
-W.F. Roadhouse (1875-1951)

â€œ[Christians are] slowly waking to the immense importance of responsibility truth. It is tragic how many evangelicals abhor responsibility truth.â€¦What will such evangelicals feel when they discover the truth at the Judgment Seat of Christ?â€
-D.M. Panton (1870-1955)

The writers of the above quotes were premillennial fundamentalists who were strong defenders of eternal security. These men also preached that disobedient Christians (who do not repent before they die) will be briefly punished at the judgment seat and then excluded from Christâ€™s future one-thousand year kingdom. This book will document that multitudes of other fundamental Christian leaders throughout history embraced the same teaching. These men were glad to see the powerful, motivating fires of this accountability truth beginning to glow among the saints. Yet, these fires were later largely extinguished; the consequences have been devastating. This precious accountability truth must be restored!

Believers who lack the full truth concerning their promises and warnings are in constant danger of becoming spiritually anemic. The Bible teaches that Noah moved with fear when he heard the holy warning about the impending flood (Hebrews 11:7). Saints in this perilous age also need the Lordâ€™s warnings to keep them running in holiness:

â€œThe denial of these solemn truths paralyses and destroys some of the most powerful stimulants God has suppliedâ€¦it empties of all horror the dread warnings to the backslider, and leaves him, if it does not put him, in a drugged sleep; and it drives privilege over the precipice of responsibilityâ€¦.â€
-D.M. Panton (1870-1955)

The Bible exhorts Christians to race for the prize of reigning with Jesus in His future kingdom:

1 Corinthians 9:24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
26 I therefore so runâ€¦
27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a CASTAWAY.

The context of this Bible passage is winning a crown at the judgment seat. What does it mean to be a â€œcastawayâ€ at the future judgment seat? Paul is certainly not worried about losing salvation in eternity. However, many advocates of the Biblical doctrine of eternal security do not interpret such warnings in their fullness. Paul is striving to have a place in the future kingdom of God. This millennial (i.e. 1000 year) kingdom is a prize for suffering against sin, the world and the Devil:

2 Timothy 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also REIGN with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:

Philippians 3:14 I press toward the mark for the PRIZE of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

2 Thessalonians 1:5â€¦ that ye may be counted worthy of the KINGDOM of God, for which ye also suffer:

Matthew 6:33 But seek ye first the KINGDOM of Godâ€¦

Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the INHERITANCE: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

Galatians 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not INHERIT the KINGDOM of God.

The above Scriptures reveal that the future millennial kingdom is a reward for faithfulness. All Christians will spend eternity with God. This is the inheritance that every child of God will enjoy. Yet, the millennial reign is a double portion. It is the inheritance that firstborn sons will receive (Deuteronomy 21:15-17, Romans 8:29, Hebrews 12:23). This privileged position is only granted to those who suffer with Christ against sin and the world (Romans 8:17, Acts 14:22, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, etc.).

Christians who will not seek the prize of the kingdom will be held accountable for their negligence. While their brethren are enjoying a double portion of glory, the disobedient Christians will receive for the wrong which they have done (Colossians 3:25). Unfortunately, many modern Christians increasingly disparage the whole idea of such accountability. They have been seduced by the blind world of humanism through the influence of agnostics, liberals and psychologists that continually drink from the cesspool of unbelief. Einstein once stated that he could not understand how there could possibly be a God who would reward or punish his subjects! John S. Spong (a liberal Episcopal Bishop) likewise presumptuously mocks the teaching that God the Father will judge His saints. To Spong, the Biblical doctrine of God keeping records in order to reward or punish on a future judgment day is similar to â€œSanta Claus.â€

God is not influenced by such humanism. In true love, He will certainly reward and punish His children according to their deserts:

Proverbs 13:24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.

Hebrews 12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chastenethâ€¦

Revelation 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.

This chapter is only an introduction to the accountability truth taught in the Bible. Many objections are answered in detail in future chapters. This truth runs deeper than many realize. Our rebellious emotions will clamor against it. To grow in understanding concerning this motivating truth, we must diligently thirst for everything that God has to teach us concerning it:

Proverbs 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
5 THEN shalt thou understand THE FEAR OF THE LORDâ€¦

Many will not understand the deep truth concerning the fear of the Lord because they do not desire to know it! Instead of diligently seeking the sobering accountability truths abundantly revealed in Scripture, many Christians actually flee them. In the 1920â€™s, William Powell Clark (Resident Magistrate) identified one reason for this increasing rebellion among Godâ€™s children:

â€œThe real reason underlying the refusal of some dear children of God to accept belief in the punishment of unfruitful believers - not eternal, but during the Millennial reign of Christ - is an inadequate sense of the Justice of God. Acceptance of the belief in the temporary punishment of such Christians during the Millennial reign safeguards the eternal merits of Christâ€™s atonement on the cross, and at the same time, preserves the absolute Justice of God.â€

Awake in the Dark

â€œAs for the black time to be expected.â€¦God grant we may be of the number of those that suffer, that...we may be raised and reign with Christ at his coming.â€
-William Twiss (1575-1649)

â€œGod shake us up. When Revival comes we shall see this [kingdom-accountability] truth again!â€
-W. F. Roadhouse (1875-1951)

Many Christians throughout history expected a revival of accountability truth in the last days. The world is growing increasingly hostile toward Biblical Christianity. Earlier writers knew that these accountability truths would be beneficial in helping a remnant of Godâ€™s seeking people to face the temptations that will surely increase as the days grow darker (2 Timothy 3:13):

â€œ...the millennial crown and the first resurrection are a REWARD - the reward of suffering for and with Christ; as I have just said, a special glory and special hope over and above the redemption hope and glory, designed to comfort and support believers under persecution: a need and use which I have little doubt the church will before long be called on collectively to experienceâ€¦.â€
-William Burgh (1800-1866)

â€œThe throne for the overcomers! Is it possible? Are they to share the throne of the Son of God? We can see now why, as we pass through the closing days of the age, there must be such terrible conflict, and why the prince of darkness will challenge every child of God who wants to â€˜overcomeâ€™.â€¦What is in the balance, therefore, for every believer in the present warfare with Satan, which must intensify as the age closes, is the millennial crown and throneâ€¦.â€
-Jessie Penn-Lewis (1861-1927)

â€œOnly now is this royal [accountability] truth emerging, and general coming persecution is likely to prove its powerful forcing-bed, for believers will see the Coming Age more clearly when they have lost this.â€
-D.M. Panton (1870-1955)

â€œNow, I do believe, there never was a time that this doctrine (the connection between reigning and suffering) would bear less to be overlooked, or required more to be brought forward....â€
-Theodosia Powerscourt (1800-1836)

â€œ...The expectation of a Millennium may then be the belief to which they will fly for refuge against the violence of the storm which assails them; and which will serve as an anchor, sure and steadfast to buoy upon and confirm their souls. Whatsoever tends to weaken their confidence in this belief so far weakens and impairs the passive resources of the Church in the days of the great apostasy when she will want every resource that she can command.â€
-Edward Greswell (1797-1869)

The truth concerning the future kingdom as a reward according to works will certainly revive in the tribulation period (Matthew 24:14). However, as we continue to see an increase in stage-setting and preliminary signs in these last days before the tribulation period, it is reasonable to expect that this kingdom-accountability truth will also begin to be revived before the rapture.

The renowned Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892) also (though indirectly) predicted a revival of kingdom-accountability truth in latter times. Robert Govett (1813-1901) was one of the foremost defenders of this motivating, sobering truth in the days of Spurgeon. Govett stood boldly for the precious truth of eternal security; yet he refused to water-down the Biblical warnings to disobedient Christians. He publicly defended his views in books and periodical debates, causing quite a stir. In regard to Govettâ€™s writings, C.H. Spurgeon predicted:

â€œWe only express our heart when we say that we venerate and admire this author and preacher, whose works will be more appreciated by future generations than by this frivolous age.â€

On another occasion, he predicted:

â€œThe day will come when the idols of the hour will perish, and the writings of such a man as R. Govett will be prized as the much fine gold.â€

Such a day has arrived! The accountability truths that Govett stood for (and so many other premillennial fundamentalists such as Pember, Panton, Craig, Tilney, Nee, etc.) are presently being revived in varying degrees throughout fundamentalist and conservative evangelical circles. The rotten fruit of rebellion (that fully manifested itself in the 1950â€™s and 60â€™s) has ironically triggered a refreshing counter-reaction among a remnant of Godâ€™s people! We desperately need to get back to the full teaching concerning the judgment seat of Christ.

The words of Ernest Baker are a fitting conclusion to this introductory chapter. Baker (b. 1869) is best known for his book, The Revivals of the Bible (1906). It is called the most comprehensive book ever written on the revivals in the Bible. Baker was a Baptist pastor in Cape Town, South Africa. He was the editor of The Midnight Cry and The South African Baptist. He writes:

â€œHow does Revival come? It comes in many ways. But one way I want to especially emphasize: And that is, that it comes by Truth that is preached with freshnessâ€¦whenever any new truth comes to light, or is recoveredâ€¦it displaces no truthâ€¦.What I want to get at is this: Is there any truth not yet grasped, but yet plainly taught in Godâ€™s Word, that, if fearlessly and plainly preached, would bring quickening to the children of God, and set them on fire with a new zeal? I believe there isâ€¦.The truth awaiting to be taught, and which will set Godâ€™s people on fire, is that the Prize of our High Calling is a Share in the Millennial Reign with the Lord Jesusâ€¦.This new light broke on me some three and a half years ago. I began to preach it with both lip and pen. But I found that many very good people and good workers were not prepared to hearâ€¦that [our Lord] would for a time exclude a believer from a share in the Millennial glory, was something that should never be said. The opposition I encountered made me go quietly for a time. But I have been digging and digging into the Word, and I now know where I am, and am prayin

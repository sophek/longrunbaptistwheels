        <h1>TOTALITARIANISM PROPHESIED BEFORE THE ANTICHRIST TAKES POWER</h1>

            "The Next Act in the Drama" (By D.M. Panton, 1936):

Revelation 17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

"One huge storm-cloud - probably the greatest now on the horizon - blackens the heavens. We are confronted with a startling revolution in the great powers of the world...The Dictators who have suddenly sprung upon the horizon...In 1917, Stalin; in 1922, Mussolini; in 1925 Kemal; in 1926, Pilsudski; in 1933, Hitler and Schuschnigg; in 1936, Metaxas and Franco...The Apocalyptic dictatorships are mentally one; so also are the modern totalitarian States: they 'have one mind' - one philosophy, one mentality, one outlook. In the words of Mr. Christopher Dawson ("Religion and the Modern State," pp.106, 129): 'The modern State aspires more and more to govern the life of the individual, to mould his thought by education and propaganda, and to make him the obedient instrument of its will. The old individualist ideal of the State as the policeman whose business it is to clear the field for individual initiative is a thing of the past. The State of the future will not be the policeman, but an all-powerful, omnipotent, human god - and a very jealous god at that. We see one form of this ideal in Russia and another in Germany. It may be that we shall see yet a third in England and America. The sun sets later in the West, but it must set at last.' That which creates modern dictatorship can spring up like lightning. 'The sudden rise of 'Rex' in Belgium,' says the Manchester Guardian (weekly ed., Oct. 30, 1936), 'should be an object-lesson for England. In Belgium, as in England, there is no defeat in war to avenge, no Communist peril, no widespread depression, no general anti-Semitism, not one, in fact, of those conditions which theorists say are necessary for the success of a Fascist party. Yet in Belgium a Fascist party in twelve months has risen from obscurity...'...The Apocalypse implies that the power lodged in the Crownless Kings is pure despotism; for when the last crises comes, 'they GIVE' - apparently without any authorization but their own - their power and authority unto the beast. This absolute despotism is a mark of all...The Ten Autocrats act alone. Mr. O.W. Reigel ("Mobilizing for Chaos," p.167) sums it up thus: - 'The world is moving rapidly into an era of universal obstruction of the free flow of information and opinion. In the name of Nationalism freedom of speech and the press has already been denied to nine-tenths of the world's population.' But the Apocalypse reveals them as a league acting together. In Lord Allenby's words: - 'Man has become a world-citizen'; and the Apocalypse discloses exactly that League of Nations toward which the world strains...it is an international league...In the summary of The Times (Sept. 26, 1936): - 'We need an international order which shall finally supersede the arbitrament of conflict between States. Many attempts have been made to find this order and they have not succeeded, but they must be continued. Civilization has to find a means of putting the promise into practice or it must perish.' So the Apocalyptic Kings accomplish the very solution of the world-problem which is inevitable. Mr. H.G. Wells ('The American Magazine,' Aug., 1934) says: - 'A world-state is in the making. A time is coming when we will say 'to the devil the parties and nations.' They do not meet the needs and aims of this new humanity, with its preposterously enlarged powers and scope...' And if these be the Apocalyptic Dictators, the NEW WORLD ORDER is to be produced by criminals committing all power to a super-criminal...Criminals, endowed with colossal power, will create the new world-state...The ideal of all opposition stamped out, all thought State-born and State-controlled, all religion centered in the State...the Ten Autocrats...hand over their combined authority to the Dictator in Rome, so producing the world-state at last. In the jungle of wild beasts there is no solution of the war-problem except the enthronement of one Beast as absolute over all...Even a purely infidel world-leader such as Professor Julian Huxley says: - 'The coming conflict is not one between religion and the secular civilization but rather between the God-religious and the social-religious,' - in other words between the worship of God and the cult of the State...'...how close must be the 'escape,' [Luke 21:36] and how urgent its conditions!"

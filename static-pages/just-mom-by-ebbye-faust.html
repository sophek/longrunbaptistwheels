            JUST MOM, By Ebbye Faust [The following introductory article is from an e-mail newsletter my wonderful wife has just started (I think she means business this time). It will be mailed out to Christian ladies every two weeks. To subscribe, simply e-mail ebbye@eaze.net with "subscribe" in the title. Here is the article. Enjoy!:] Hello Sisters in Christ! I can't tell you just how thankful I am to be able to share with you the things that the Lord has shown me from His Word! I am also excited to share with you the many different practical things the Lord has taught me in the last several years that have shaped my ministry as a wife, mother, homemaker and pastor's wife. You know as well as I do that we are fighting a battle. So few Christian women understand their calling, and it is a burden on my heart to help women understand the blessings and glories of submitting to the Lord's will for their lives. Oh, what a wonderful feeling it is to wake up in the morning, to look around my home, and to know that everything I do in it will be to bless those who live in it! That I have a real purpose, and that I am needed in this home. They try to make you feel needed in the workplace - that they couldn't get along without you - but they can. At my former desk there sits someone who has replaced the position that I left years ago. But I know that in my home, there is no one to replace me. If I don't perform the duties that I have to do, they remain undone. Being a homemaker is the very fabric of society. The very stability. Would you call our society stable? I wouldn't either. All of the homemakers have left the home and become business-builders. They are working to put money into someone else's pocket. They put their children into daycares and public schools so they themselves can earn the title of "Working Woman" and fulfill the dream that Hollywood has put into their heads. "I would go crazy at home, what in the world would I do all day?," some women have said to me. "Dear woman," I think, "Little do you know!" What do I do all day? From the beginning of my day until the end, my time is filled with productivity! When I clean and organize my home, I am producing a place of refreshment. When I kiss little boo boo's and dry little tears I am producing a bond of trust. When I create a special atmosphere in my home I am producing a place of joy and peace. When I sit down just to listen to the events in my husband's day I am producing unity. When I take time to counsel someone in distress I am producing friendship. When friends and family feel welcome in my home I am producing hospitality. When I run all of my errands, set (and sometimes reset!) schedules, cook meals and so many other things, I am producing an efficiently run home. Most of all, at the end of each day I can rejoice in the fact that my Saviour was honored, and that He is pleased with my service. Please consider this letter: "I have 3 children and have been driven to work since my first was born. I have thrown myself into it wholeheartedly because I feel like something. I feel good, I feel needed, I feel like I am serving and good will come back to me in the world someday. When I do not work, I feel lost, saddened, like I need to isolate myself because of that. It's not because I am a stay at home mom that I feel less (cause some make you feel that way), I just feel more to myself, my life, than just being 'mom.'" How my heart broke as I read these words. How I longed for this woman to understand how needed she really is by her husband and three precious children! How much good she could do in her home. I once heard a quote that went something like this: "You can either be a little to many, or you can be the whole world to a few." Unlike the above writer, through Jesus, I am more than happy to be called "just mom." What a life is mine! What a joy! What a service. I am called to be what I am. A homemaker.

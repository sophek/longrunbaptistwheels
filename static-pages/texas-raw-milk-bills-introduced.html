â€œâ€¦Bills to allow licensed raw milk dairies to deliver their milk directly to their customers at home or at a mutually convenient location like a farmers market have been introduced in both the Texas House and Senate and have already gained bi-partisan supportâ€¦

Currently Texas Department of Health regulations limit the sale of Grade A raw milk<a href="http://www.pegasusnews.com/r/38/36747/">â€œonly at the point of production,â€ namely on the farm</a>.

â€œThis means that customers must drive to the farm each and every time they want to buy milk,â€ explained Judith McGeary, the executive director of the Farm and Ranch Freedom Foundation and a supporter of the legislation.

â€œActually, this makes the milk less safe,â€ she added. â€œMost of the people who buy raw milk travel well over an hour to get to the farm. In the middle of summer, the drive back can expose the milk to extreme temperatures.â€

Much of the opposition to raw milk stems from a mistaken belief that only pasteurized milk is safe to consume.

â€œProcesses like pasteurizing helped prevent some problems when they became standard almost sixty years ago, but a lot has changed and we now have the ability with refrigeration, stainless steel, and other advances, for farmers to bring raw milk safely from the farm to the consumers,â€ McGeary noted.

Pasteurization also robs milk of some of its naturally occurring vitamins, according to Christina Peteet, RD, LD, a registered and licensed dietician.

â€œPasteurization happens at such a high temperature that it diminishes the vitamins and minerals that are naturally occurring in the milk. With raw milk, you donâ€™t have that problem,â€ she explained.

McGeary noted that raw milk has an excellent safety record in Texas with only two reported cases of illness from raw milk reported by the Centers for Disease Control from 1998 to 2008.

â€œDuring that same time period in Texas, there were over 12,000 foodborne illnesses reported traced to such foods as strawberries, mangos, cake, beans, lettuce salads, salsa, cheeses and many other foods,â€ she saidâ€¦.â€

Comments:

May government leaders quit hindering peopleâ€™s honest, common sense pursuit of health. Raw milk (especially raw goat milk) is the BIBLE way.

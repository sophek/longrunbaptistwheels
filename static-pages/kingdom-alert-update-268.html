FROM THE EDITOR
**********************
There is so much in the news, and so much to write on, and so many things I have a burden to share - and there is so little time, and so little space. Yet, I always try to be open to the Lord, and what He places on my heart to write. Seek ye FIRST the Kingdom of God! The fear of the Lord is the BEGINNING of wisdom! Errors on these subjects will spill over into practically every other issue. The breaches in the wall must be repaired. And some modern Sanballats have arisen to try to hinder the work. Therefore, with one hand we work, and with the other, we wield our weapon! I pray these short lessons on accountability will stir up your pure minds to fear, love, and holiness.

******************************
HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!
******************************
1. Multitudes of our Founding Fathers were born again.

2. Almost all of them professed to be Christians (not Muslims, etc.).

3. Almost all of them were vigilant against Roman Catholicism, and its dangers, spiritually and politically.

4. Almost all of them taught that liberty, as a gift of God, was a fruit of morality and responsibility in the fear of God.

5. Almost all of them predicted that if God's people ever stopped fearing God, and living for Him, their liberties would crumble.

6. Almost all of them would drop dead of shock to see patriotic and Christian people praising the so-called "Patriot Act."

7. Almost all of them would drop dead of shock to see multitudes of Roman Catholics flooding into the country daily, for decades, while many conservative leaders look the other way, leave the borders wide open, and work on plans to grant the millions of illegal Roman Catholics VOTING rights! (Mr. President, BUILD UP THAT WALL!)

8. Almost all of them would be shocked to see how quickly the stage would be set in America, and the world, for the fulfillment of Revelation 17, where Rome ascends to power, and the nations of the world are found to be in the hands of KINGS (monarchies) with practically absolute power over their kingdoms (see 17:12-13)!

9. Almost all of them would think of Jezebel and Naboth's vineyard if they were to hear of America's new "eminent domain" law.

10. Almost all of them would be shocked to see "churches" lining up to beg for money from the government to supposedly do the Lord's work!

11. ALL of them would cry if they could see how many millions of babies have been murdered by people pretending to use "American liberties" as their justification - in the name of the Founding Fathers.

Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

JEREMIAH AND THE ROD
*****************************

Jeremiah 1:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I SEE A ROD...

Romans 11:21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.

The prophet Jeremiah was sent to proclaim the message that God's people would be punished for disobedience by Babylonian captivity:

Jeremiah 4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and BURN THAT NONE CAN QUENCH IT, because of the evil of your doings.

7 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.

The punishment would be temporary (Jeremiah 5:18); yet it would be devastating - especially for those who ignored the warnings. This message was met with scorn! "How dare you warn US, the people of God, that WE may be temporarily chastised! You are not sound in the faith!":

Jeremiah 5:12 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon US; neither shall WE see sword nor famine:

22 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence...?
23 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God...

Jeremiah 6:10 To whom shall I speak, and GIVE WARNING, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken...

14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

"There will be no chastisement! There will only be peace!" Jeremiah was accused of misunderstanding the special relationship that God had with the Jews. He was accused of not understanding the special privileges granted to the Jews. How could they, who have the "temple of the Lord" in their midst, ever be punished like one of the less privileged nations?:

Jeremiah 7:4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

12 But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of MY PEOPLE Israel.

Jeremiah warned the people that the teachers who tried to neutralize God's warnings by appealing to their privileges were deceived. They did not have a good understanding of Biblical history (1 Corinthians 10:11)!

Although he met with fierce opposition, even from his own "familiars" (Jeremiah 20:10), the Lord was with Jeremiah:

Jeremiah 1:8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
19...they shall FIGHT AGAINST THEE; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

We need more Jeremiah's among God's people today. The Lord has given to us a similar message in the New Testament. The Lord has warned the disobedient believers, today, that they will be scattered among the unbelievers, if they do not repent:

Jeremiah 9:16 I will scatter them also AMONG THE HEATHEN, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.

25 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised WITH the uncircumcised;

Luke 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion WITH THE UNBELIEVERS.

47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

Yet, as in the days of Jeremiah, there is no shortage of positive thinking teachers who will cry "peace and safety" to carnal churches, and rebellious believers, who feed themselves without fear:

Jeremiah 23:17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, NO EVIL shall come upon you.

 
And instead of repenting of sin, and fearing God, and trembling before the Lord's warnings, the majority of religious leaders began to attack the messenger who proclaimed the Lord's warnings to His people:

Jeremiah 26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, THOU SHALT SURELY DIE.

9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, THIS HOUSE shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.

13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.

16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.

18 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.

19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? DID HE NOT FEAR THE LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them?...

 
At this point (verse 16), we see that the "priests and prophets" had lost some of their ground. There was an awakening to the fear of the Lord among the people. This only made the wrath of the religious leaders burn hotter against Jeremiah!

One of the most vocal leaders against Jeremiah's warnings was the prophet Hananiah (Jeremiah 28:1). He felt that it was his mission in life to stop Jeremiah. In his religious zeal, he made sure he had an audience before all the people, and he put on a spectacular show for them:

Jeremiah 28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, AND BRAKE IT.
11 And Hananiah spake IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

This issue was not simply a personal matter between two prophets. The land was in apostasy. There was little fear of the Lord. His warnings had been despised. The people had become proud of their privileges and the grace that was shown unto them. The Lord was warning them that "terror" was soon to come upon them. But Hananiah's lies were keeping the people from seeking the Lord and amending their ways in fear. Perhaps Hananiah felt that he was "contending for the faith." He probably felt that he was standing for the promises delivered unto the fathers. He likely felt that he was fighting for the distinctions between the circumcised and the uncircumcised. Yet, in his blind zeal, he was in the way of true revival. He was a proud, stubborn prophet. He was keeping the Lord's people from calling upon the Lord in fear and mercy while He may be found. In short, he was getting many people killed, who believed his "positive" lies:

Jeremiah 28:15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.

16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught REBELLION against the LORD.

17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
 
I am certainly no prophet in the Old Testament sense of the word. And I wish I had half the burden of the "weeping prophet" for the people of God (Jeremiah 13:17). But I must confess, when I examine Scripture, and examine the state of the Lord's people today, I also SEE A ROD COMING (Jeremiah 1:11). The Hananiah's of this age will temporarily have their day. Yet, they would do well to remember that the Lord is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. He is well able to defend His warnings, and His preachers, in due time. The most important thing is not the praises of men, but to be on the Lord's side.

Notice, it is REBELLION (Jeremiah 28:16) to wrongly use the privileges and promises of God to neutralize His warnings, and make them a covering for sin (Romans 6:1, 16).

 
Therefore, the issue has always been whether or not the people of God allow certain teachers to DECEIVE them into thinking that God cannot or will not judge sin:

Jeremiah 29:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, DECEIVE YOU...

Galatians 6:7 BE NOT DECEIVED; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

Ephesians 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

6 LET NO MAN DECEIVE YOU with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 

The Book of Jeremiah certainly gives us a detailed picture of how many, otherwise, sound teachers and preachers will react to any true revival of the fear of God:

1 Corinthians 10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.

12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

Temporary punishment, in the days of Jeremiah (contrary to what the popular prophets advocated) did not cause the promises of God to fail:

Jeremiah 30:11 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.

It is the same with the New Testament antitype. God will not leave His disobedient children unpunished. However, He will certainly make a distinction between the saved and the lost. He will not make a FULL end of His children:

1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself SHALL BE SAVED; yet so as by fire.

Matthew 18:34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, TILL he should pay all that was due unto him.

35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

Luke 12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with MANY STRIPES.

Revelation 20:5 But the rest of the dead LIVED not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.

6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death AND HELL delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
15 And WHOSOEVER WAS NOT FOUND WRITTEN in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

Revelation 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be ANY MORE PAIN: for the former things are passed away.

Yet, we can expect the MODERN HANANIAH'S not to understand these basic distinctions. They will continue to mutter repetitiously, "the temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these" (Jeremiah 7). They have used their privileges to become blind and deaf to the warnings:

Joshua 23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, THAT AS ALL GOOD THINGS are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; SO SHALL the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

Romans 11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

But Jeremiah's eyes were opened to see the COMING ROD (Jeremiah 1:11). The religious leaders, with their games, proudly proclaimed that God would SPARE THE COMING ROD (Proverbs 13:24). They were wrong. And whoever followed them soon regretted it. God judged the "positive" prophets, and destruction fell upon everyone who rejected the Lord's warnings, and did not "move with fear." He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!

 
*********************************
CONTINUOUS ETERNAL LIFE
*********************************

I believe that we are saved by grace through faith alone in the Blood of Jesus, and that no believer will ever perish in eternity. Every believer possesses eternal life as a free gift the moment he believes the Gospel. Nothing a believer experiences in this life, at the Judgment Seat, or during the Millennium, will ever rob him of being with the Lord in happiness on the last day. And there is not one stripe suffered, or one tear shed, that can ever take away, or add to, this gracious blessing of eternal life. The Millennium (the day of reckoning according to works) is in time. These thousand years are only a drop in the vast ocean of eternity. Exclusion from this Kingdom (for disobedience after salvation) will not take away from the gift of eternal life, to be fully experienced on the last day by every believer.

 
Nevertheless, there are some who see John 10:28 as a real objection to Kingdom Exclusion:

John 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

The argument is phrased in the following manner:

"[Faust] claims that this eternal life that you cannot lose does not have to be continuous..."

This is a very confused objection. It argues that no true believer will ever be temporarily slain (or even chastised) at the Judgment Seat of Christ. The argument is that since every true believer possesses eternal life (and this eternal life must be continuous), it therefore follows that no believer can ever be temporarily slain (or even chastised) at the Judgment Seat of Christ.

It takes only a little Bible study to expose the shallow nature of this objection. The Bible teaches that true believers, who possess eternal life, are sometimes made sick, or even killed:

1 Corinthians 11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh DAMNATION to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and MANY SLEEP.

Did these believers lose their "continuous eternal life"? If they did not, then how is it that their bodies were killed without their eternal life being limited? Certainly, the emotional objectors to Kingdom Exclusion must confess that a true believer can temporarily die in his body without his "continuous eternal life" being lost or interrupted. They must also confess that this death can be the result of judgment by God upon their sins. Therefore, these objectors believe:

"God can kill a true believer without the believer losing eternal life."

There are certain questions, then, that should be asked of these objectors:

1. Can the Lord kill a backsliding believer with fire (such as an explosion, lightning, etc.)?

2. Does the fire have to be an earthly fire?

3. Does the Bible ever reveal the Lord having a fiery breath?:

Isaiah 30:33 ...the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

Isaiah 11:4 ...and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

4. If the Lord wanted to, could He kill a backsliding believer by BREATHING on him?

5. Can the Lord temporarily kill a backsliding believer by breathing on him, when He suddenly appears at the Second Coming?

Revelation 2:16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches...

Luke 12:45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

6. If He ever did so, why would temporary death on the day when the Lord will render to every man according to His works, be any different than the Lord judging a believer in the present, in the day of His longsuffering?

7. Why would temporarily killing a believer by the Lord's fiery breath today NOT interrupt "continuous eternal life," yet, we are being asked to believe that if the Lord temporarily killed a believer tomorrow, at His coming, it WOULD somehow interrupt his "continuous eternal life"?

The Biblical teaching on the subject is simply that chastisement IN TIME (regardless of how it is administered, or where) does not in any way limit the possession or promise of eternal life through faith alone. The Judgment Seat of Christ and the Millennium are in time. Jesus teaches that EVERY believer will be raised on the last day after the Millennium (John 6:40). There will then be nor more pain or crying for any believer. These chastisements in time do not limit God's promises (in any dispensation), or cause His faithfulness to fail:

Psalms 89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

***************************************
ONLY JELLY AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT?
***************************************

There are some pompous objectors to the warnings of King Jesus (to His disciples) who would like to dogmatically claim that the Lord can only administer stripes when THEY say that He can. They teach that the Judgment Seat of Christ will be a picnic, with all the peanut-butter and jelly you can eat. But what will happen to disobedient, unfaithful, backslidden believers? Will they tell Jesus that He is not allowed to do any real "judging" WHEN HE COMES TO JUDGE? Does all real judgment happen BEFORE the day of judgment?

These objectors nod approvingly at the idea of the Lord judging believers, in this age, before He actually comes to judge:

1 Corinthians 11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be JUDGED.
 
All such judgment is in this day of the Lord's longsuffering, patience and grace:

2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but IS LONGSUFFERING to us-ward...

Romans 2:4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?

5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the DAY OF WRATH AND REVELATION of the righteous judgment of God;

6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

Today is not the day of wrath, terror, or judgment. It is not the day of rewarding every man according to his works. Today is the day of the Lord's grace and patience. There are some who tell us that the Lord can only judge His people IN THIS DAY! Yet, the BIBLE tells us that the Lord will ALSO judge His people in the day of His judgment:

1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that JUDGMENT must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

2 Corinthians 5:10 For WE must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men...

It is ridiculous to think that the Lord's judgment will be GREATER (more severe) while His longsuffering is WAITING (1 Peter 3:20), than when it finally comes to an end! It is absurd to believe that the Lord can administer stripes in the time of His patience, yet He is not permitted to judge on the day of judgment! Who do these people think that they are?:

1 Samuel 2:3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.

Malachi 2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

Will judgment be lesser for disobedient servants when the Master of the House appears, than when He was away?

Let these brethren see in Paul's words a good picture of what things will be like when the Lord appears:

2 Corinthians 10:9 That I may not seem as if I would TERRIFY you by letters.
10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, SUCH WILL WE BE ALSO IN DEED WHEN WE ARE PRESENT.

Some were saying that Paul's letters were stern, but his presence was fluffy and light. In other words, they believed that when he appeared, he would not LIVE UP TO WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN. Yet, these objectors to judgment at the Lord's coming go beyond this. They tell us that the Lord can sometimes be stern now, in this age of His "letters," but that when He appears, He will not chastise any believer, regardless of how he has lived. These believers are making a mistake about the Lord that goes far beyond the mistake the Corinthians made about Paul!

There is much in Scripture that can encourage those who are fighting the good fight in this day of the Lord's mercy. The Lord is not unrighteous to forget. Yet, some, like Saul, will run out to meet Jesus like Saul met Samuel, saying: "Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD." They will have been blinded to multitudes of Scripture warnings.

The Lord that can scourge His people in the day of His mercy, patience and warnings, is the same Lord that can scourge a believer when the day of warning has ended, and judgment begins at the house of God!:

Hebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, THE LORD SHALL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE

31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

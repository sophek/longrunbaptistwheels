            BUT HOW GOOD DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO GO IN THE PRE-TRIB PARTIAL RAPTURE? (Pt.1)
"But How Good Do You Have To Be To Go In The Pre-Trib Partial Rapture?"

The last excuse given for rejecting the pre-trib partial translation of the worthy Christian is indeed a silly one. Yet, the excuse is used as the ultimate objection in almost all major works arguing against the doctrine. It can be shown that this objection is rooted in passion and emotion instead of the Scripture. "But how good does a Christian have to be to get translated before the tribulation?" Many that use this question as an argument against the pre-trib partial rapture, hold to a double standard. The majority, if not all, believe a Christian must be good to prove that he is saved in eternity! (But, how good?) The partial, pre-trib rapture is rejected because the measure of required godliness is not clear, yet the Catholic doctrine of looking to works for assurance of salvation in eternity is readily embraced!? (Another home-run for Lao tzu, Buddha and Confucius.)

Let us cite a few examples of this emotional, contradictory argument:

"The partial rapture theory conditions the privilege of rapture upon human works, and as such is a co-mingling of legalism with grace...Grace, not fear of the Tribulation, is the motive and the power for right conduct... But if translation depends upon spiritual maturity, on readiness, or upon "watching," it then becomes necessary to ask: Just how ready must the believer be? What degree of spiritual maturity will God require? What degree of perfection must the believer attain before he is assured a place in the rapture?"
Gerald B. Stanton, Kept From The Hour, pp.166-168, Schoettle Publishing Company.

"The theory is based on the idea that good works are necessary to qualify for the rapture, a theory which becomes almost immediately untenable when the question is asked: 'How much works?'."
John F. Walvoord, The Millennial Kingdom, p.251, Zondervan.

Such an argument is unreasonable for the simple fact that such a question assumes that God wills for His people to have absolute assurance they will attain reward. Where in Scripture is there any hint that Christians are to know for sure they will be rewarded? Much of modern Christendom has somehow twisted itself into quite a contradicting tangle of weeds. Think about it! If a man says a Christian is to have absolute assurance he is saved by the death of Christ, without the subjective, confusing evidence from works, he is called an "antinomian". Catholicism and many of today's "anti-Catholic" ministries deny assurance of salvation apart from works. In denying assurance apart from works, absolute assurance is then made impossible! How much works? How good? "Just how ready must a believer be"? "What degree of perfection must the believer attain before he is absolutely assured salvation in eternity?"

You say James 2 and 1John teach us that we know we are saved in eternity because we have works and love the brethren? To boast of absolute assurance in such a system of salvation, one would have to be the biggest, most self-righteous, deluded, pompous, arrogant, pharisaical hypocrite on the face of the earth! (Luke 18:11)

They have it backwards. We are to have absolute assurance of salvation in eternity, that we will be raised up on the Last Day by the Cross of Christ. No works are need to verify or prove it. Any second source of vague "evidence" trusted in, would throw the whole thing out of court as a mis-trial! Yet, after we are saved, we are to work for reward. And we are to strive for assurance of this reward daily. But we are expressly warned against absolute assurance in regard to attaining this reward. That would be presumption. Therefore, many seek absolute assurance where they should be seeking only a general, hopeful confidence. And vice versa.

This is why reward is always called a "hope". Christians should hope that they will be rewarded with a pre-trib translation to glory. However, they are commanded to refrain from absolute assurance of such a worthiness:


1 Corinthians 4:
2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.

Philippians 3:
11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

1 Corinthians 10:
12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

Psalm 139:
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Luke 21:
36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

"How good do you have to be as a Christian to get the pre-trib rapture?" Christ said be perfect. Don't sin. Be as good as He told you to be. "But we all sin". Oh yes. Yet, some sin worse than others! We are therefore in need of mercy. We are told that we get mercy granted when we fear God. (Ps.103:11, Lk.1:50) Many that deny God will punish His people by leaving them behind in discipline, forsake much mercy on the day of reckoning. "How good do I have to be to be sure?" Imagine a runner asking how fast he had to run, right in the middle of the race! Go! Run as fast as you can by His grace. Never rest in absolute assurance of reward. Trust in the absolute possibility, but leave the final, absolute judgment of yourself to Him. But know this: If your heart condemns you, He certainly will. (1Jn.2:28, 3:18-22, Lk.21:36)

"How good"? Tell us, doctors, how good does a man have to be to prove to himself he is not only a pretender or a false professor? How many works prove a true Christian in your Romanized system of subjective assurance through works? How good? Then tell us how good a Christian has to be to win the crowns you preach about, and you will have found your answer.

        <h1>ANTHRAX AND COLLOIDAL SILVER </h1>
        <div id="content">
            Luke 21:11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and PESTILENCES; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. "That ominous cloud of anthrax Pentagon bio-defense planners fear may fog some future battlefield could actually have a SILVER lining for Lansing, Mich.-based Bioport Corp. - and for its most visible corporate director, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. Thatâ€™s because the company is the only licensed U.S. manufacturer of ANTHRAX vaccine. Less than a month after it took over the business from the state-owned Michigan Biologic Products Institute (MBPI) last September, Bioport landed an exclusive $29 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to 'manufacture, test, bottle and store the anthrax vaccine.' According to former Central Intelligence Agency military analyst Patrick Eddington, the estimated $60 million worth of anthrax vaccine Bioport is expected to produce for the Defense Department over the next five years could just be the beginning. 'The Pentagon has a $322 million, 10-year program to develop at least three, and perhaps as many as a dozen additional biological warfare vaccines,' Eddington told ABCNEWS." (ABC News.com, 20/20, March 12, 1999) "Bayer boosts production of anthrax antibiotic - The antibiotic Cipro has gone from relative obscurity to part of Americaâ€™s new vocabulary in less than two weeks.

Just 14 months since Bayer Corp. became the only company to receive Food and Drug Administration approval to produce the anthrax antibiotic, demand is exploding. Bayer, which has a patent on the drug until 2003, has begun producing Cipro seven days a week, 24 hours a day...On Tuesday, the company announced it would more than triple production of the drug and has told the government it will be able to deliver 200 million tablets in the next three months..." (Oct.16, 2001, MSNBC) "Several people taking Cipro have developed toxic shock reactions. A half-dozen ambulance calls to new building in last couple days. . . people having convulsions." (Drudge/Lucianne.com, Oct.19, 2001) "Antibiotics Help in 2nd Anthrax Case - ...Dr. Arthur M. Friedlander, an anthrax expert at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., said... 'There is some data in animals suggesting that treatment [for anthrax] later in the course of infection with antibiotics can be successful in some cases,'..." (Las Vegas Sun, Oct.16, 2001) The "silver" is the first news report above refers to money. However, I would like to discuss another use of silver that might benefit God's seeking people in these last days.
Anthrax (a bacteria) is certainly in the news. This is stage-setting for the Tribulational fulfillment of Luke 21:11. We know the worst is therefore yet to come to the world. Through watching, waiting, and casting our cares on the Lord, He will take care of us in these perilous times. Since anthrax, etc. is in the news, I would also like to share a practical bit of insight I have discovered. Perhaps the reader has never heard of colloidal silver. I have to admit that when "Pa Vincent" first began attending our church a few years ago, I was VERY skeptical when he first explained it. I knew he had much experience living among the Mennonites, etc. and had learned many self-reliance skills over the years. But the idea of hooking a battery generator to pure silver wire (not sterling) and then "zapping" a glass of water seemed to me about as nutty as one could get! Over the years we have been blessed in the Lord to often avoid taking drugs by using various herbs such as garlic (a natural antibiotic), goldenseal (a natural antibiotic), yarrow (for coughs), mullein (for coughs), etc. Don't get me wrong. I praise God for good doctors when we need them (Col.4:14). But many people take dangerous, expensive drugs unnecessarily (and weaken their immune systems), when they could easily build UP their immune systems with a little "poor man's medicine" and good deal of prayer. When relaxing, I love to research the amazing nutritional value of wild foods, the healing benefits of herbs, and the nutritional benefits of eating REAL food (not modern man's imitation, antibiotic-laced, hormone-laced, preservative-laced, refined, chemical "food products").

I like my Bible and my daily bread both to be the "real thing." So I am not one of those people that believe that if something is "modern", and in a package with pretty pictures on it, it must be good for you. I like my Bible with the "thee's" and the "thou's", and similarly, if food looks too pretty, I know someone has corrupted it with dyes, waxes, dips, chemicals, etc. I believe that we need to read between the lines. I believe God protects His seeking people. I also believe that God protects the poor (Luke 6:20), if they will be wise and not simpleminded. There are thousands of families that home-school (with stay-at-home moms) that often cannot afford expensive medical bills. They cannot afford to pop prescription antibiotics at the slightest signs of sickness. Since I know God takes care of His people, I would expect inexpensive, healing alternatives to exist. I also would expect many to have financial reasons for keeping these alternatives as quiet as possible. (You can't patent silver; but you CAN get a patent for various drugs! Read between the lines.) I therefore should have expected colloidal silver to be a Godsend. Yet, the idea of hooking a battery up to my drinking water initially appeared about as far away from my ideas of what is healthy as one could get! But after a year or so of off and on research and watching others who were using silver (I wanted to make sure they didn't start picking up radio signals or talking with static!), I became convinced of its amazing ability to fight infections. As a teen, I would have to take prescription antibiotics for a regular occurrence of strep throat. After coming down with one of the worst cases I ever had awhile back, I tried some colloidal silver and, by God's grace, was healed. I had never been able to "kick" strep throat without penicillin, etc. before. I began to realize that the silver indeed kills whatever little "beasties" get in its path! When the particles are suspended in water by an electrical charge, they do no harm to the human body.

But these particles are DEADLY to the little beasties!
Why am I writing this article? One reason is that everywhere I read in the news I see ANTHRAX and the possible danger of biological warfare. The other reason is that colloidal silver is so handy around the house I hate to think that some fellow Christians have not heard about it yet. I recently saw a headline about how hospitals might be unprepared to handle a national outbreak. I read about drugs with strange names selling out. There is talk about buying and stockpiling antibiotics from feed stores. I immediately reasoned that it would seem logical that even the little biological beasties (such as anthrax) would not be able to stand before colloidal silver if it was digested in time, and taken in a large enough amount. It is reportedly one of the most powerful, natural antibiotics. It works by disabling the enzyme that one-celled bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites need for their oxygen metabolism. Therefore, it suffocates them! (Yet, it reportedly does not harm the beneficial tissue-cell enzymes since they are more complex than the enzymes of primitive single-celled life. However, to preserve beneficial intestinal bacteria, buy some real yogurt at a health food store. Save a bit, and then make your own.) Antibiotics kill 6 or so disease organisms; silver is said to kill at least 650! Another amazing thing is that when it kills, resistant strains fail to develop. Also, people do not eventually develop immunity to this natural antibiotic. In spite of all this, sadly, many are forced today to sell colloidal silver as ONLY a nutritional supplement. They are not allowed to make any medical claims. After further study, I found that silver is indeed reported to be highly effective against anthrax and other dangerous biological agents. In one of the first articles I found in my research ("Hi Ho Silver Away! Mild Silver Protein and its effectiveness against internal and topical infections"), James South MA. writes: "Silver is surprisingly non-toxic to humans and animals. And unlike the other heavy metals, Silver has a long history of successful medical and public health use dating back 6000 years!...The modern era of Silver usage began in 1893, when C. Von Nageli reported the first systematic investigation into the lethal effects of metals [especially silver] towards bacteria and lower life forms....To primitive life forms oligodynamic silver is as toxic as the most powerful chemical disinfectants and this, coupled with its relative harmlessness to [animal] life, gives it great potential as a disinfectant...However, with the coming of the antibiotic era, Silver rapidly fell into disuse and the medical 'memory hole', as it was replaced first by sulfa drugs, then penicillin (post WWII), and since then by hundreds of specialized antibiotics...Yet by the 1990's the picture began to change again...more and more germ species previously controlled by antibiotics began to develop ways to combat antibiotics. This in turn gave rise to so-called 'super-germs', such as killer E. coli, 'flesh-eating' strep A bacteria...[etc.]...The overprescription of antibiotics by doctors under pressure from their patients, for ailments where they are useless (e.g. against common viral diseases such as cold and flu); the failure of patients to take the full course of their prescribed antibiotics (allowing germs to recover and develop antibiotic resistance); and the widespread use of low-level antibiotics in animal feed to increase farmer's profits (40% of U.S. antibiotics go into animal feed), have all helped create antibiotic-resistant bacteria...hosts of exotic diseases once isolated to small areas of the planet are now showing up all over. Malaria is once again returning to the U.S.

The exotic and deadly Ebola virus has broken out in a lab in Maryland. Shigella (which causes dysentery) was practically unheard of in America before 1990, but it is now being spread from contaminated fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. under NAFTA, and is now routinely seen at clinics in California. Perhaps the scariest scenario that may present a need for a powerful, broad-spectrum antimicrobial such as Silver is the late 1990's threat of 'bioterrorism.' It is now widely expected by biowarfare and terrorism experts that, whether due to small groups of terrorists, or as a form of warfare by 'rogue'/totalitarian nations...it is only a matter of time before 'germ warfare' is unleashed in Europe or America...It is interesting to note that silver - both in liquid solution and as an airborne-aerosol - has been known since 1887 to be extremely toxic to ANTHRAX spores...And it is widely reported in the medical literature on Silver that various forms of Silver, often at surprisingly low concentrations, routinely kills germs that are known to be antibiotic-resistant...unlike antibiotics, Silver is an 'equal opportunity destroyer' - it doesn't discriminate, but effectively kills germs of all major types: gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, fungus/yeasts, viruses and protozoal parasites....In short, as pioneering silver researcher Dr. Henry Margraf has stated, 'Silver is the best all round germ-fighter we have.'...Many of the doctors using silver in the first half of the 20th century preferred a colloidal form of Silver, either chemically or electrically produced...Colloidal Silver and mild Silver protein (MSP) are useful in treating virtually any infectious condition; they were used to treat literally hundreds of infectious conditions from 1900 to 1940..." Colloidal suspension might seem strange. But homogenized milk is an example of a colloidal suspension. Colloidal silver is available in most health food stores. You can make it yourself with a generator. If you can't someone in church to teach you how to make one, just look up how to make construct one "online." (For example, see: http://www.millennium-ark.net/News_Files/Colloidal_Silver.html) Or if you choose, buy a generator. You will also need pure silver wire. $10 will get you a foot of pure silver wire from various companies. (For example, see: http://www.utopiasilver.com/silverwire.htm).

Some claim that the best protection against biological warfare agents is to have the colloidal silver in your system at the time of exposure. Of course, if you think you have been exposed to anthrax, go see a doctor. However, if there is ever a widespread problem, and hospitals or doctors are unavailable, it appears that wisdom would tell us to pray, and then give some regular doses of colloidal silver to each member of the family!

<p align="JUSTIFY">On October 1st, 2011 The City of Fort Worth shut down Main Street so that people associated to the Tarrant County Gay Pride Parade And Festival could flaunt their sins before all and bring reproach to this once conservative city. This event was readily endorsed by the City of Fort Worth leadership as the mayor of Fort Worth, Betsy Price, served as a co-grand marshall in the parade and city councilman Joel Burns served as a parade participant. Likewise, The Fort Worth Police department, made it clear what side they were on regarding this issue.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> A couple dozen Christians stood for the Lord on this day. The preachers were told by FWPD they could not utilize the megaphone they brought as it was illegal. The preachers resisted, instructed the officers on the law and the officers relented. After multiple physical assaults by the parade participants against the preachers, the parade ended in a festival area in front of the Fort Worth coliseum. FWPD stood on the sidewalk nearest the festival and on the side of the sodomites. When the preachers attempted to preach near the coliseum they were rebuffed by the officers saying that the festival was private property and a closed event. Without invitations, tickets or other unique entry criteria, the officers were making judgments on who could freely enter based on their outward appearance of faith. They were denying access to this public event to Christians because they were Christians.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The preachers obeyed the orders of the officers and set up across the street from the festival. The video shown below demonstrates the unbalanced treatment of the officers as they take no adverse action against a sodomite who uses a vulgar curse word three times. Not only is this individual not cited or arrested but he's actually patted on the back by an officer. Shortly thereafter, four officers approach the street preacher and arrest him for disorderly conduct/language. The below is an excerpt of the narrative of the police report and the corresponding video that clearly demonstrates that the Fort Worth Police Department will protect and encourage sodomites who use foul language and yet arrest a street preacher for using foul language, even though he didn't utter the offensive word.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">On 10/01/11, I Corporal L.A. McGee #2982 was working off-duty traffic control and security for the Tarrant County Gay Pride Parade and Festival. After the parade ended, the festival portion of the event began and was held at 900 Main St. A group of very vocal anti-homosexual protestors had formed on the two north corners of the intersection of 8th and Main Streets, holding signs and shouting anti-homosexual "preachings" through a megaphone. The shouting could be easily heard throughout the area of the festival.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At approximately 1225 hours, ARR1 Shaun [******] said loudly through the megaphone, "When ya'll have had your time [******] each other, and when you've had your time kissing each other....," and he continued yelling. I heard the statement and as I turned to look at [******], VIC [******] approached me and asked if it was legal for a person to use the "f-word" as [******] had done. I asked him if he was offended by the language, and he said yes and added that he would like to complain about the language.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Officer C.J. Brady #2887 and I notified Sergeant R.A. Dehoyoe #2337, who advised us to cash bond [*****] for the offense. Officer Brady and I then walked over to [*****] and placed him under arrest for Disorderly Conduct/Language and seated him in the back of a patrol vehicle to await transport. ...</p>

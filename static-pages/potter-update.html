            "(AP) - Wizards vanquished lizards as 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' grossed $93.5 million in its first weekend, shattering the box-office debut record held by the dinosaur sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 

I appreciate those that prayed for the radio debate in Canada. I believe it went well. Some Christians called in and helped me give a warning and testimony for our Lord. The host told me that the majority on his screen agreed with me against Potter. Some, of course, called in with no understanding of spiritual things (1 Cor.1, 2). The man presenting the opposing view said he was a Christian. He is a librarian and runs a Harry Potter fan club. He seemed to say there was no great danger. But when I continued to mention things, he would say things such as, "We do need to be careful and critical." Once children become gods to parents and grandparents, these adults will no longer listen to reason. Anything that gets in the way of their god's fun is seen as "extreme." I did my best to ask how parents could allow their children to read books where the main characters they identify with use cuss words, rebel against authority, etc. Some simply replied that the Simpsons and other programs have done this for years, and therefore it is no big deal. I documented the link with Crowley and how occultists openly use fiction and allegory. I explained that C.S. Lewis and Tolkien WERE WRONG for writing stories with GOOD wizards, and that Rowling has simply taken this error to the next level. I explained the true nature of witchcraft and showed how the Bible condemns it and predicts its revival in the last days.

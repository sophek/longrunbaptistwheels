        <h1>SOME RECENT STATISTICS ON CATHOLICISM IN THE U.S. </h1>
        <div id="content">
            Catholicism has now become the largest single religious denomination in American population and congress:

"The Catholic Church, with a record number of 62 million followers in the United States, is facing a severe shortage of priests with no short-term solution in the fold. The number of Catholics in the United States has grown 34 percent since the mid-1960s, primarily through immigration...A report reviewed by the bishops held a number of alarming facts. The Catholic population has grown strongly all across the United States in the past 40 years, but most aggressively in the West and the South. The western U.S. has seen an explosion of 261 percent, while the South has seen 196 percent growth. In the East, church rosters are up 52 percent while the rise is 59 percent for the Midwest...While a priest in 1950 had an average parish size of 650 people, the average size nationwide in 1999 was 1,200. For the West, the ratio was one priest for every 1,752 worshippers...Adding to the mix in Southern California, where Cardinal Roger M. Mahony already leads the nationâ€™s largest archdiocese of 4.5 million Catholics, is the huge influx of immigrants, primarily from Latin America and Asian-Pacific countries. But there is a difference to this wave of immigration than others in U.S. history, Coiro said. 'When the Irish came, they brought their priests with them. When the Italians came, they brought their priests with them,' he said. This time, though, there is a worldwide shortage of priests and few nations, other than Poland and Nigeria, seldom have priests to spare. Mahony has looked to Mexico to fill some of his under-served parishes, which includes severe overcrowding in places such as one in Pico Rivera where two priests serve 5,000 families..."

"In 1997, the US Society and Values magazine published an overview of religion in the U.S., using data from the Pluralism Project at Harvard University. They reported:
-63% of Americans (163 million) state that they are actively affiliated with a faith group: Roman Catholicism is the largest single religious group (60 million; 23%)...
-Islam is numerically the fastest growing organized religion in the U.S.

The 1999 'Catholic Almanac' reports that there are 61.5 million Catholics in the U.S.; they comprise 22.7% of the population. This makes the United States the third largest Roman Catholic country in the world, after Brazil and Mexico..." (http://www.religioustolerance.org/us_rel.htm)

Revelation 17:1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great WHORE that sitteth upon many WATERS:
15 And he saith unto me, The WATERS which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

Preach the pure Gospel (not Romish works), and come out of her!

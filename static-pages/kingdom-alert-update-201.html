            BEWARE OF THE DEVIL'S LIBERTY AND LOVE!

2 Corinthians 11:3 But I fear, lest by ANY MEANS, as the serpent beguiled
Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in Christ.
14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an ANGEL OF LIGHT.
15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as
the ministers of RIGHTEOUSNESS; whose end shall be according to their
works.

The Devil is raging. Wake up children of God! Most Christians know that
the Devil appears as an angel of "light"; but too many forget to apply
this knowledge in these latter days wherein Paul teaches that deception
will continually increase (2 Timothy 3:13). The Devil appeared to Eve as a
"savior," who had come to "liberate" her from bondage (Genesis 3:5). If
the Devil can convince a person in PARADISE that she is in "bondage," how
much more will he be able to convince people OUTSIDE of paradise (who are
foolish enough to listen to him) that God's commandments and ways are
"grievous"? This is one reason the Bible continually warns Christians to
be sober, and to beware of deception (1 Corinthians 6:9, 15:33, Galatians
6:7). As a buffer against the Devil's lies, the apostle assures us that
God's commandments are NOT "grievous":

1 John 5:3 For THIS is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
his commandments are NOT grievous.

The Lord's ways and laws may, at times, appear grievous to our flesh or
self-will. But when we walk in obedience by the power of the Spirit, His
commandments will ultimately bring true liberty and peace:

Psalms 119:45 And I will walk at LIBERTY: for I seek thy PRECEPTS.

John 13:17 If ye know these things, HAPPY are ye if ye DO them.

On the other hand, the Devil's "liberty" always brings death, banishment,
and curses upon mankind. Although he cannot steal ultimate eternal life
from the saints, he can, nevertheless, inflict great misery and harm upon
believers who listen to his lies. Therefore, beware of the Devil's
liberty!:

Isaiah 55:2 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and
your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken DILIGENTLY unto me, and
eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
7 Let the wicked FORSAKE HIS WAY, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to
our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
8 For my thoughts are NOT your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
saith the LORD.

The Devil's liberty is always a liberty FROM God's commandments - usually
under the banner of obedience to Scripture. This liberty FROM God's ways
and commandments almost always brings an initial, false "joy" (James
4:8-9, Luke 15:13). Yet, it soon brings BONDAGE to SIN. It is a principle
of Scripture that obedience to one commandment gives power to obey others
(Proverbs 21:21, 1 Thessalonians 5:8, Ephesians 6:4). Likewise,
disobedience to one commandment, brings a snare in regard to others
(Psalms 73:2-3, Proverbs 7:8, 13). The Devil's lying liberty always brings
BONDAGE to sin:

John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you FREE.
33 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in BONDAGE to
any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
committeth sin is the SERVANT OF SIN.

Psalms 119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any INIQUITY have
DOMINION over me.

Psalms 19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
not have DOMINION over me...

Romans 6:14 For SIN shall not have DOMINION over you: for ye are not under
the law, but under grace.
16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, HIS
SERVANTS ye are to whom ye obey; WHETHER OF SIN unto death, or of
obedience unto righteousness?

2 Peter 2:19 While they PROMISE THEM LIBERTY, they themselves are the
SERVANTS of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in BONDAGE.

The Devil is a liar!:

John 8:44....for he is a LIAR, and the father of it.   

Since he is a liar, he will often (when necessary) call God's ways "evil,"
and his own ways "good" and godly:

Isaiah 5:20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and
sweet for bitter!
23 Which justify the wicked...

Therefore, we must beware of the Devil's love and liberty! He has shown us
that he is well able to "quote" Scripture to attempt to prove his points
(Luke 4:10). The Holy Ghost teaches that Paul's epistles are in some
places hard to be understood, and will be used (as all Scripture) by the
Devil:

2 Peter 3:15....even as our beloved brother PAUL also according to the
wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which
are some things HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD, which they that are unlearned and
unstable WREST, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own
destruction.

To "wrest" is to pervert the intention or application of the Scriptures.

Along with a perversion of liberty, the Devil will entice mankind with a
false view of "love." Notice some neglected Scriptures concerning TRUE
love:

Revelation 3:19 As many as I LOVE, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous
therefore, and repent.

Proverbs 13:24 He that spareth his rod HATETH his son: but he that LOVETH
him chasteneth him betimes.

Psalms 97:10 Ye that LOVE the LORD, hate evil...

Amos 5:15 Hate the evil, and LOVE the good...

Proverbs 27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.
6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are
deceitful.

Leviticus 19:17 Thou shalt NOT HATE thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt
in any wise REBUKE thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your LOVE may abound yet more and
more in KNOWLEDGE and in all JUDGMENT;
10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere
and without offence till the day of Christ;

John 14:15 If ye LOVE me, keep my commandments.
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, HE it is that LOVETH
me...
24 He that LOVETH me not keepeth not my sayings...

1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is
a LIAR, and the truth is not in him.
5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the LOVE of God perfected:
15 LOVE not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
man LOVE the world, the LOVE of the Father is not in him.
16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
world.

1 John 5:2 By this WE KNOW that we LOVE the children of God, when we LOVE
God, and KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS.
3 For THIS IS THE LOVE of God, that we keep his commandments...

Any teaching which separates "love" from "obedience" is an ANTICHRISTIAN
spirit of deception:

2 John 1:6 And this is love, that we WALK AFTER HIS COMMANDMENTS. This is
the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk
in it.
7 For many deceivers are entered into the world...This is a deceiver and
an antichrist.

The first lie the Devil uses to replace true, Biblical love with his own
unholy counterfeit, teaches that since it is a great error to obey the
"least" of the commandments and forget the "great" ones, it is therefore
UNLOVING to obey the least! But this is absurdity. The Devil knows that if
he can seduce us into disobeying the least, he is well on his way to
getting us to disobey the greatest:

Song of Solomon 2:15 Take us the foxes, the LITTLE foxes, that spoil the
vines...

Romans 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and MAKE NOT PROVISION
for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

Jesus Christ taught that the least of the moral commandments were to be
preached and obeyed!:

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these LEAST
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the
kingdom of heaven...

Matthew 23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the WEIGHTIER MATTERS
of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these OUGHT ye to have done, and
NOT to leave the other undone.

Judgment, mercy and faith are the weightier matters of God's law. However,
true love for God will not neglect building on this foundation in
diligence!

Others object and preach that our obedience must not be done in a grudging
manner. Too often, popular teachers use this to justify a casual, sloppy,
mystical, antinomian response to God among God's people. This modern,
ear-scratching babble will not bear fruit. It turns the grace of God into
lasciviousness (Jude 1:4). God calls us to be DILIGENT in obedience
(Deuteronomy 6:17, Psalms 119:4, Proverbs 11:27, Isaiah 55:2, Hebrews
11:6). The very "commandments" we are called to obey teach a joyful
obedience:

Deuteronomy 28:47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with
JOYFULNESS, and with GLADNESS of heart, for the abundance of all things;
48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies...

Psalms 100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness...

The very "commandments" we are called to obey teach that we should not
serve God to be seen of men (Matthew 6:2). They teach that we should keep
our eyes on God, and REJOICE in expectation of His reward for our service:
 
Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, AS TO THE LORD, and
not unto men;
24 KNOWING that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

Obedience to THESE commandments will keep us from becoming weary in our
service:

Galatians 6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: FOR in due season we
shall reap, if we faint not.

But those who have been deceived by the Hollywood, hippie, psycho-babbling
spirit of this age, will not teach obedience in this manner. Instead, they
will use the abuses of the Pharisees to fall into mysticism and
lawlessness. Street preachers know that these deceived Christians will
object to open preaching; yet THEY will loudly preach that others should
not be preaching! Why is it proper to rebuke street preaching, yet wrong
to rebuke abortion, sodomy, fornication, worldliness, drunkenness, etc.?:

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as
keep the law contend with them.
5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand
all things.

People will object to sins being named and reproved, yet THEY will loudly
and publicly reprove the imagined "sin" of exposing and reproving sin!
They will teach that people should not judge others in regard to sin, yet,
at the same time, THEY will openly JUDGE people who they believe are
committing the "sin" of judging! They will say there is no "love" because
others are reproving and judging, yet THEY spend much time and energy
REPROVING AND JUDGING the supposed sins of reproving and judging! How
absurd! If we are not to reprove sins in others, then why do these people
dare to REPROVE those who are reproving others? If we are not to "judge"
(according to their definition of the word), then why do they JUDGE the
people that are supposedly judging? If "love" never rebukes, reproves, or
preaches against sin, then why do they reprove, rebuke, and preach against
the "sin" of not loving people? To these people, it is "loving" to spend
time and energy reproving other Christians for preaching against sin, yet
it is somehow "unloving" to try to talk a woman out of paying a "doctor"
to crush the skull of the living, precious infant in her womb. It is
"loving" to spend time and energy reproving other Christians for preaching
against sin, yet it is somehow "unloving" to warn Christians against the
sodomite agenda that seeks to prey upon, and pervert the children in the
schools and churches. It is supposedly "loving" to spend time and energy
reproving other Christians for preaching against sin, yet it is somehow
"unloving" to try to show a person he is a sinner so he might be moved to
believe the Gospel and be saved from eternal torment in the Lake of Fire.

What shall we then say to these things? It is not the TURNING OF THINGS
UPSIDE DOWN?:

Isaiah 29:15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who
knoweth us?
16 Surely your TURNING OF THINGS UPSIDE DOWN shall be esteemed as the
potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not?
or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
understanding?
17  Is it not yet a very little while...?
20 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the SCORNER is consumed,
and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
21 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that
REPROVETH IN THE GATE...
 
The sins in this chapter (to be fulfilled in the tribulation period) will
also be found in the final falling away at the end of this present age.
First, there is an outward "form" of godliness (v.15); yet, while at home,
in the dark night (v.20) vile iniquity is "watched" on television and the
computer. In general, the commandments of Scripture are "scorned" (v.20);
God's ways are despised as if HE has no understanding (v.16)! Surely, this
is perverted! Notice, that these people will make a man an offender for a
"word." Strong preaching will become an unacceptable "hate crime." And
those who are openly STREET PREACHING (v.21) will be persecuted with lies
and snares.

In this final falling away, obedient Christians will be hated and despised
(2 Timothy 3:3). Which side are you on? Choose ye this day whom you will
serve.

What You Can Do To Protect Yourself From The Devil's Unholy Love And
Liberty

1. Avoid worldly friends (saved or unsaved), novels, television, and
movies. These things are filled with the Devil's poison. The Bible teaches
separation BEFORE Bible study:

Psalms 1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh NOT in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of
the scornful.
2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
meditate day and night.

God's truth will be hidden from us if it is mixed with poison in our
hearts. The preaching of the Word at church will be of no profit if a
Christian does not separate at home.

2. After separation from corruption (1 Corinthians 15:33), study the Bible
diligently for the main purpose of exposing sin in your own life, and
drawing nigh unto God.

3. Submit yourself (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13) to a pastor that preaches and
teaches the truth, and does not hold back (Hebrews 13:17). Pray for him,
and attend faithfully, and constantly, the preaching of the Word (Hebrews
10:25).

4. Pray often (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Be sure to confess every known sin,
and forsake it, everyday. Ask to reveal the sins that you do not yet see.

5. Stay busy in active, weekly soul-winning and discipleship ministries.
This will keep you constantly dealing with rebellious hearts, and it will
help keep your own heart in the fear of God, when you have to answer their
stiff-necked complaints and excuses. The Bible teaches that soul-winning
is a crucial part of our armor against the Devil (Ephesians 6:15). Those
that do not stay active in soul-winning and discipleship, become
self-focused, depressed, immature, confused, and bitter.

These things are not the full extent of our obedience and armor against
the Devil, yet they will go a long way in protecting you from delusion in
these last days:

1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

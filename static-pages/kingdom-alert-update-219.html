SODOM RIPENS: "GAY" DAY AT THE BALL PARK IN ARLINGTON, TX
*******************************************************************
Luke 3:18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he [John the
Baptist] unto the people.
19 But Herod the tetrarch, BEING REPROVED BY HIM for Herodias his brother
Philip's wife, AND FOR ALL THE EVILS which Herod had done,
20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

Luke 7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for
to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold,
they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings'
courts.

Amos 5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightly.

Proverbs 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as
keep the law contend with them.

The homosexual agenda damns souls and destroys lives (spiritually and
physically; in this life and the next). Some brethren in our church
(brother Rick Warden, with the help of Sophek Tounn) have put together a
special website to organize Christians to take a salty stand against this
perversion: http://www.protestgayday.com

I have contributed some new articles on this website. Some titles include:

"Kangaroo Science: The Root of the New Monkey Morality"
"The Gay Gene Fable"
"The New Religion of 'Love'"
"Does God Love Homosexuals? Yes...and No!"

The last article, mentioned above, proves that much of professing
"Christianity" has been Satanically "feminized" against authority and
masculinity in all its forms (see Jude and 2 Peter). Many today are
unknowingly, "doctrinally" and "emotionally," on the same level as the
Christ-rejecting UNITARIANS in the 19th century (at least in regard to the
meaning of TRUE LOVE, etc.). Read it and see! This should not be
surprising. Almost our whole, public educational system (which should be
discarded) for a century has been rooted in the Darwinian, Freudian,
Unitarian Humanism of Dewey, Charles Potter, Ingersoll, Fosdick, etc. This
is the primary spirit that is shipwrecking Christians around the world
today (1 John 4:1).

Years ago, this unholy liberalism was received with open arms after the
19th century Catholics wrote multitudes of bitter, TRULY INTOLERANT
articles advocating the DEATH PENALTY (whenever they could get back in the
seat of power) for anyone who defended and preached the doctrines of
religious liberty! Infidels (inspired by the crafty Serpent) used these
hostile and venomous articles from Rome to swing the free world overboard
in the other direction! The world (and too many churches) embraced a new,
foolish definition of "toleration": Nice, tolerant, 'educated' people will
approve (or at least, passively ignore) every perverted sin, vice, and
doctrine imaginable; they will stand back and passively allow the
promoters of these perversions and doctrines to prey upon the youth; they
will tolerate everyone, without a protest or frown, EXCEPT the intolerant
Christian who exposes this logic as the biggest bunch of hellish stupidity
the Devil could ever invent to destroy society, families, and souls!

And there you have it. What has been the fruit of this "new approach"? It
has been rotten. Come Lord Jesus! In the meantime, we must obey the
following Scriptures:

2 Timothy 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto fables.

There has been a great deal of media attention (secular and Christian)
concerning this controversial website (e.g. interviews broadcasted on
Channel 8 Television News, 820 AM with Mark Davis, Dallas Observer, and
many other media sources). Please pray that God will use our witness for
His truth to convict many of sin by His Spirit, that they may receive the
free gift of eternal salvation and also repent of their destructive
perversions. We cannot convert the whole world. But we can, and should, be
light and salt, and do what we can until our Lord comes.

If you are in the DFW area, call in to the Scott Wilder Show, Tuesday
afternoon (9-9-03), in the 4:00 hour. Sign the online petition. And
prayerfully consider gathering outside the Texas Ranger Ballpark on
Sunday, September the 14th, at 6:00PM to be a witness for Jesus and His
truth. With all the media attention, this would be an opportune time to
hold a Scripture sign, hand out a tract, "rebuke in the gate," or just
stand to show the precious youth that sodomy is NOT natural, normal, or
morally acceptable with God.

Having ballgames on the Lord's Day (when Christians should gather at
church), and the sale and consumption of alcohol, etc. are bad enough. But
now, through pride, the fullness of bread (Ezekiel 16:49), and the
destruction of the moral foundations, Sodom is RIPENING to full, rotten,
maturity! At the very least, please pray for those who will be witnessing
for the Lord's truth on this so-called "gay day." These people are not
happy. Many are some of the saddest, depressed souls you could ever meet.
They need the truth to set them free.

LESSONS FROM THE STREET
******************************
I wore a ProtestGayDay.com shirt to downtown Ft. Worth. I was quickly
stopped by a young, professing Christian couple. The following is a record
of the exchange. If the response of this couple were unique or rare, it
might be dismissed as simply strange words from babes in Christ. However,
I testify that this attitude of confusion is so common from religious
people from every denomination and cult, that it can only be explained as
the attack of seducing spirits, predicted by the Scriptures:

COUPLE: "You should not wear a shirt with those words!" (All the shirt
said was ProtestGayDay.com).
ME: "Why not?"
COUPLE: "Because Jesus said not to judge!"
ME: "Do you know where He said that?"
COUPLE: "Jesus taught love. We shouldn't judge people!"
ME: "I am greatly offended. Why are you attacking me? Why are you judging
me? You have come over to judge me and rebuke me when I was minding my own
business."
COUPLE: "What do you mean?"
ME: "You have come over and stopped me, to judge me about my shirt. You
don't like the words on my shirt."
COUPLE: "No, we are not judging you. Really, you can wear what you want.
You have a right to wear what you want. We were just disagreeing with your
view and wanted to tell you. We have a right to tell you what we think."
ME: "I see. Well, then you understand that I disagree with homosexuality,
and I have a right to tell people what God says about the sin. So if you
can tell people what you think, I can surely tell people what GOD thinks,
right?" [After a long moment of confusion]:
COUPLE: "But Jesus said to take the beam out of your own eye!"
ME: "Yes. What then is my 'beam'?"
COUPLE: "Everyone sins!"
ME: "But all sins are not the same. If a man called you a name, this would
not be as bad as beating you or killing you."
COUPLE: "That is not true!! It would be the same."
ME: "No, there are some sins that Christians can commit that should cause
them to be excommunicated from the church. But all sins should not be
dealt with in this fashion."
COUPLE: "That is not true. The church is the only place they can be lifted
up. They should be lifted up, not torn down and rejected."
ME: "But we are dealing with people that have already rejected restoration
through repentance. They must be properly disfellowshipped by the church"
COUPLE: "That is not Jesus. Jesus is about kindness and love. Notice how
He dealt with the woman at the well."
ME: "He told her she had had five husbands."
COUPLE: "That was only because He was a prophet."
ME: "Can I please read you something? Notice these words in 1 Corinthians
5..."
COUPLE: "But that is not loving. Jesus is about love!"
ME: "But it is the BIBLE. Our ignorant minds are so small compared to God.
He tells us not to lean to our own understanding. He says, 'My ways are
not your ways.' We should let Him teach us what love is, and how to deal
with people."
COUPLE: "All we know is that Jesus is loving."
ME: "Yes, but my point is that some sins are to be dealt with publicly by
excommunication, and some sins..."
COUPLE: "We just follow Jesus! Come on, I have heard enough of this hate."
ME: "Friend, I just read you what PAUL said. We haven't even discussed..."
COUPLE: "Well, we take Jesus over Paul."
ME: "That is antichrist. The WHOLE Bible is..." [The couple ran away in an
emotional fit before I could say a word more.]

Now, I understand that there are many ways I could have handled this
situation. And I have learned that the people who witness the least, who
have never once preached on a street corner or sidewalk, are the quickest
to explain exactly how it should be done. On another occasion I might have
certainly assured myself as much as possible that the couple was truly
born again. But aside from how I should have responded, the lesson that I
continue to learn, and would like to share with the reader, is this: Under
the banner of false love, the Devil is seeking to neutralize God's people
into passivity where they will lack the boldness to confront sin and
proclaim the truth. Many of us have "tried" this spirit and found it to be
pure wickedness in sheep's clothing. This world, and our churches, are not
in the state they are in today because the few bold preachers that are out
there need to sweeten up a little, and perhaps learn discretion in some
areas. These things are certainly true; however, the world and our
churches are in the state they are in because of "2 Peter 2 preachers" who
are scratching everyone's ears with passivity and false liberty, keeping
holiness undefined and subjective (and the people love to have it so, and
are heaping to themselves such teachers). God is not mocked. What a man
sows, that shall he reap.

======================================================================
I dedicate the following article to Jon Kokko who first got me thinking
about Job 21:24:

******************************************************************
IN DEFENSE OF THE A.V. AND LITERAL INTERPRETATION: NURSING FATHERS?
*******************************************************************
Job 21:24 HIS BREASTS are FULL OF MILK, and his bones are moistened with
marrow.

I am smiling as I begin to write this. This particular subject is one that
makes me a bit uncomfortable. My wife has been having a lot of fun teasing
me about it. She keep saying, "You will lactate in three weeks." No,
little Atarah wants nothing to do with  Daddy when she is hungry! And that
is fine with me!

In researching for the scientific foreknowledge articles, I discovered
many places where various examples were dismissed because the scholar (who
professed to be defending the faith and the inspiration of the Scriptures)
stated something to the effect of: "This historic example is probably not
to be taken literally since it is in the context of an 'obviously'
figurative chapter." I then studied such chapters and failed to see the
so-called "obvious" allegorical nature of the various verses. While I
certainly admit that the Bible uses parables and figures, I have found
that the "figurative sense" is often wrongly appealed to. Sometimes, it is
because the commentator simply wants to escape the responsibility that the
literal sense implies; or sometimes, the literal sense appears absurd. But
we must be careful. Early commentators thought it would be absurd to
conclude that people in every nation could see the dead bodies of the Two
Witnesses in Revelation 11. Today, with satellite television, the
internet, etc., no one finds this absurd.

Therefore, let us begin. Here is the "hard Scripture":

Job 21:24 HIS BREASTS are FULL OF MILK, and his bones are moistened with
marrow.
26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

Most commentators RETRANSLATE verse 24 because they cannot understand how
a man's breast can be "full of milk":

"His sides are filled out with fat." NAS)
"His body well nourished." (NIV)
"His body full of fat" (RSV)
"...healthy, wealthy, fat..." (TLB)
"His PAILS are full of milk." (NKJV)

Other commentators spiritualize the verse. But there is no reason not to
take the verse literally. People often prosper, for a season, even in
gluttony and drunkenness. And physicians maintain that overeating can lead
to an increased breast size in adult males. But can men's breasts actually
contain milk? Notice some other Bible verses:

Numbers 11:12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a NURSING FATHER
beareth the SUCKING child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their
fathers?

Isaiah 49:23 And kings shall be thy NURSING FATHERS, and their queens thy
nursing mothers...

It is known that women who are not pregnant can often nurse children:

Ruth 4:16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
nurse unto it.

The great missionary, David Livingstone, in his, "Missionary Travels and
Researches in South Africa" (1858), writes:

"I have examined several cases in which a grandmother has taken upon
herself to suckle a grandchild."

But is it possible for MEN to breastfeed? Male breasts do have milk ducts.
And there have been many reports of male breastfeeding. David Livingstone
continues:

"Is it not possible that the story in the 'Cloud of Witnesses' of a man,
during the time of persecution in Scotland, putting his child to his own
breast, and finding, to the astonishment of the whole country, that milk
followed the act, may have been literally true? It was regarded and is
quoted as a miracle; but the feelings of the father toward the child of a
murdered mother must have been as nearly as possible analogous to the
maternal feeling; and, as anatomists declare the structure of both male
and female breasts to be identical, there is nothing physically impossible
in the alleged result. The illustrious Baron Humboldt quotes an instance
of the male breast yielding milk..."

In, "Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine," by George Gould, M.D. and
Walter Pyle, M.D. (1896), the following cases of male breastfeeding are
reported:

"Hunter refers to a man of fifty who shared equally with his wife the
suckling of their children. There is an instance of a sailor who, having
lost his wife, took his son to his own breast to quiet him, and after
three or four days was able to nourish him. Humboldt describes a South
American peasant of thirty-two who, when his wife fell sick immediately
after delivery, sustained the child with his own milk, which came soon
after the application to the breast; for five months the child took no
other nourishment. In Franklin's 'Voyages to the Polar Seas' he quotes the
instance of an old Chippewa who, on losing his wife in childbirth, had put
his infant to his breast and earnestly prayed that milk might flow; he was
fortunate enough to eventually produce enough milk to rear the
child....According to Mehliss some missionaries in Brazil in the sixteenth
century asserted that there was a whole Indian nation whose women had
small and withered breasts, and whose children owed their nourishment
entirely to the males. Ford mentions the case of a captain who in order to
soothe a child's cries put it to his breast, and who subsequently
developed a full supply of milk. He also quotes an instance of a man
suckling his own children."

In recent times, Ananova.com reports (November 1, 2002):

"Widower learns to breastfeed - A Sri Lankan widower has attracted the
attention of doctors for his ability to breastfeed his young daughter. Mr
B Wijeratne, from Walapanee, near Colombo, took to breastfeeding her soon
after his wife died three months ago while giving birth to their second
child....His elder daughter, 18-month-old Nisansala Madhushani, was so
used to her mother's milk that she would not take formula milk....The
38-year-old's ability to produce milk was noticed by doctors at the
government hospital in the town of Kurunegala. Dr Kamal Jayasinghe, a
spokesman for the hospital, said: 'Men with a hyperactive prolactine
hormone can produce breast milk.'"
(http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_700634.html)

"Discovery Magazine," in an article entitled, "Father's Milk" (Feb.1995),
reports:

"We've known for some time that many male mammals, including some men, can
undergo breast development and lactate under special conditions."
 
Therefore, the prosperous (perhaps gluttonous) man in Job 21:24 can
LITERALLY have breasts full of milk. It is possible that this was more
common in ancient times.

This cannot be used to justify homosexual and feminist propaganda. From
the beginning God made them male and female! There was a Mommy and a
Daddy, not two Mommies or two Daddies. From the beginning, Adam was to be
the "breadwinner" and the "saviour of the body" by working in the field,
and Eve was to bear the children and "guide the house" (1 Timothy 5:14).
The New Testament confirms this ancient arrangement and warns that those
who subvert it can cause the word of God to be blasphemed (Titus 2:4-5).
Yet, the virtuous woman in Proverbs 31 is not absolutely confined to the
house as a prisoner (Proverbs 31:16). And the man who will not be involved
at all in nurturing and chastising children, and some domestic affairs,
will not have a very happy wife! But to what degree ancient men literally
nursed children is hard to say. Scripture plainly and certainly presents
it as primarily the woman's role and duty. My simple point is that there
is NO reason to interpret Job 21:24 in a figurative fashion, regardless of
exactly how, or why, that rich, fat man has milk in his breasts.

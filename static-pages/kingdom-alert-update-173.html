-RIGHTLY DIVIDING BIBLE WORDS: HEAVEN, WINE, AND SALVATION

-NEWS FROM THE FRONTLINES: A LETTER FROM ITALY CONCERNING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ROMANISM =================================================

RIGHTLY DIVIDING BIBLE WORDS: HEAVEN, WINE, AND SALVATION

The need to properly define Bible words is great in this shallow age. There are multiple examples that could be cited in this article. I have chosen three words that will serve as an example of how we must be careful not to ignore revealed variations in meanings. A good set of English dictionaries, a Bible concordance, some hard work, and prayer, will solve most any interpretation problem. I recommend Webster's Dictionary (1828), Oxford's English Dictionary, and Funk and Wagnall's, 1895, Standard Dictionary of the English Language, and Webster's, 1956, New Twentieth Century Dictionary (unabridged). There are others, but these will serve as a foundation, and will meet most any need, debate, or controversy concerning the English language. Older "Bible" dictionaries and encyclopedias can also be helpful. Even the older ones tend to be liberal and modernistic in some places. But they can at times be of much help.

Notice the following two Scriptures:

Deuteronomy 11:11 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of HEAVEN:

2 Corinthians 5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from HEAVEN:

It is clear to most observers that the word "heaven" is each of the preceding verses refers to something different. The first "heaven" refers to the sky above earth. The second verse refers to the third Heaven, where God's throne presently abides:

2 Corinthians 12:2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the THIRD HEAVEN.

This teaches us that we must be careful concerning Bible words. We must study variations in meanings, the rest of Scripture, and the context:

2 Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

It might be argued that no one would get confused concerning the word "heaven." No one would try imagine that earthly fowls fly around, or that rain falls from clouds, in God's Heaven. But there are other places where people do get confused. And the consequences are much greater concerning these words.

The Word "Wine"

For example, many people get confused over the word "wine" in the Bible. They see that this word is used as something good and proper in some places, and they therefore are forced (through not understanding that there is more than one type of wine) to ignore the clear warnings against alcohol. The Bible does not command us to drink alcohol moderately. It commands us to avoid it to such a degree that we do not LOOK at it:

Proverbs 23:31 LOOK NOT THOU UPON THE WINE when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
35 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I WILL SEEK IT YET AGAIN.

This is not some Mosaic ceremonial law. This is a moral law for all ages. Alcohol is addicting and destructive. We are therefore commanded not to make provision for addiction. So-called "moderate drinkers" must sin against this clear, moral command of the Holy Ghost in Proverbs.

But what about the Bible verses that describe "wine" as something good? Notice the following two verses:

Proverbs 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy PRESSES shall burst out with new WINE.

Isaiah 65:8 Thus saith the LORD, As the new WINE is found in the CLUSTER, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

Ripe GRAPES are PRESSED. Ripe GRAPES are found in the CLUSTER. Therefore, "wine," in many passages, refers to fresh GRAPE JUICE. One might ask, "But why are Christians warned to drink grape juice moderately?" If we will ask this question, we might as well also ask why we are told to EAT HONEY moderately:

Proverbs 25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much AS IS SUFFICIENT FOR THEE, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
27 It is not good to eat MUCH honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.

There is not much difference between "honey" and rich grape juice. It is sucrose. We are warned to flee over-eating and over-drinking. The warning is not just against alcohol. It goes further:

Luke 21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

"Surfeiting" is over-eating. "Drunkenness" need not be limited to the effects of alcohol on the brain. We should let our moderation in all things be known unto all men (Phil.4). Being gluttonous in food or drink is immoderate and wrong. Aged women, aged men, pastors and deacons should all set a holy, moderate example for younger Christians in regard to food and drink. Such temperance goes beyond abstaining from alcohol:

Temperate: "1. Moderate in the indulgence of the appetites and passions; as temperate in eating and drinking; temperate in pleasures; temperate in speech." (Web.1828)

The Bible does not command us to drink alcohol "moderately." It commands us to avoid it to such a degree that we dont even LOOK at it.

Perhaps some would have trouble imagining how it could be a bad example for the older Christians, pastors and deacons to abuse grape juice. But this only because our society has gone so far beyond this that drinking grape juice all day would appear moderate! We may, I am sure, apply this to the constant abuse of tea, coffee, coke, soda pop, diet soft drinks, etc. by the majority of Christians today. I use to a coffee drinker and was quite addicted to it. This was a bad example to Christians. When I counseled one young man to forsake his cigarettes, he retorted that I was addicted to coffee! He was correct. I drink mainly water now, and for the past few years it has been a blessing to be free from addiction to colas and coffee. There is much money wasted in these unhealthy luxuries, and mature Christians (who are called to be examples) must eat and drink in moderation.

The Word "Saved"

Acts 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be SAVED.

Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he SAVED us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye SAVED through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

James 2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith SAVE him?
24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

It should be obvious to all that the word "saved" in Acts 27:31 does not refer to being saved from eternal torment. It means to be saved from the physical death of drowning. However, it is equally obvious that the word "saved" in Ephesians 2:8 and Titus 3:5 DOES refer to being saved from eternal torment. This "salvation" is said to be by grace through faith alone, not of works. But James teaches that we are "saved" through faith and works. Luther attempted to solve the problem by doubting that this epistle of James was inspired. Others simply turn faith into works and end up with "faith-works." These people never reason that if the word "saved" can be used for the deliverance of a person from a stormy sea, then certainly it can be used to describe the deliverance from God's disapproval at the Judgment Seat of Christ! James is writing to Christians (see 2:1). These saints are guilty of despising the poor. James uses the example of Abraham's justification in Genesis 22. But this was years AFTER Genesis 15, where Paul said he was justified apart from works (Romans 4). James is therefore discussing how a CHRISTIAN gains approval from his Lord as an obedient son. It is not through faith alone. It is through faith and works that we will stand approved and accepted in our daily walk and at the Judgment Seat of Christ:

Hebrews 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through FAITH AND PATIENCE inherit the promises.
13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

In the above Scripture, Paul uses the same example of Abraham in Genesis 22, which occurred years AFTER his justification through faith alone. It is a double blessing that we gain through obedience (i.e. Surely blessing, I will BLESS thee). This blessing of being found worthy and approved at the Judgment Seat of Christ (for Millennial inheritance) is not granted through faith alone (like eternity). It is only granted through striving, working, enduring, continuing, racing and reaching by faith!:

2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore WE LABOUR, that, whether present or absent, we may be ACCEPTED of him.
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

NEWS FROM THE FRONTLINES: A LETTER FROM ITALY CONCERNING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ROMANISM

Dear Brother Faust, I just finished reading KA #172 and found it very interesting and if I may, I would like to share a few additional points of interest that you may or may not be aware of. First allow me to say that this is not a diatribe against the Italian people, but are merely my/our observations and conclusions. The things I share are daily happenings that prove that a society without the Gospel is out of order and develops at a much slower pace than places where the Bible has had an opportunity to touch the hearts and lives of its citizens. The things we share are prevalent here in southern Italy, the region of Basilicata, but apply to most of the southern part of the nation. Ariel and I have been here in Italy for a little over 16 years and we are very aware of what havoc the Roman Church had unleashed on this (and many other) nations. May I first point out that there are many folks both in our church and in the villages that we minister in, that DO NOT KNOW HOW TO READ OR WRITE! In this year of 2002, 33 years after the first men walked on the moon, there are still people who are completely illiterate. True, most of them are older folks, but even at that, there are many in their 30's and 40's who read on a very low level. My brother, it is almost impossible for me to put into words, the effect that Romanism has had on this culture. I have much difficulty with preaching and teaching as the comprehension level with MOST of our saints is probably at or around a 4th or 5th grade level. Since they read so poorly, the people do not read, thus, ignorance is the result and all that logically follows. It is nearly impossible to reason with these folks, either about "religion" or about common things such as science or world events. All of this is, I am sure, a result of the Roman Church's concerted effort to keep the people ignorant and poor. As opposed to the Puritans and Luther who encouraged the founding of schools and universities with the direct goal of enabling the masses to be able to read the word of God, the Roman Church chose to keep the people in the dark (dark ages?). Not much has changed.

I will try to share the lack of public liberty that exists, due to centuries of Roman influence and dominance. It is so difficult during Bible studies to get personal opinions or ideas from the people. After one shares his thoughts, the rest will automatically agree. Here in the south, everyone goes to the same places on vacation, wears the same basic kinds of clothing and are very aware of the searching eyes of all as they walk through the village. If you dont play the social game, surely someone will call you up on it....

As you well know, Italy has never had a national revival of Biblical Christianity in the 2000 years since the Gospel arrived on these shores. No wonder that the fabric and foundation of this land is such a mess. There is corruption in every corner and dishonesty reigns. We must always be on our guard for some type of dishonest action whenever we purchase anything. The sense of honesty and integrity, in these villages where we live, is unknown. The lack of Biblical influence in Italy is obvious to all who have lived under the guidelines and customs rightly established by God fearing ancestors and founders. Even in secular America, England and Canada, one sees the awesome cultural mindset that prevails in so many aspects of our great nations. Principles set down in the Word of God, that at one time, were in the hearts of the people. These principals may not be in Americas heart as at one time, but they are sewn into the fabric of our democracy and culture.

As one drives on the roads of Italy, you will notice a total void of kindness and highway courtesy. It is truly "Every man for himself." American military leaders who try and help servicemen and women and their families to become accustomed to the Italian driving habit say; "Most Italians believe that the autostrada (interstate) was built for them and for them alone." Words cannot describe what it is like to drive on Italian roads, rural or interstate. Our son in law who recently returned from his first visit to America was overwhelmed by two things apart from the beauty and grandeur of our nation. He loved driving on our roads as everybody was kind and courteous, giving precedence to others, stopping for others and being careful in built up areas. The other factor was how orderly our society is, especially being noticed in the banks and post offices - no pushing and shoving, cutting in line and arguing with each other (also the efficiency of the folks behind the counters and desks). He loved the Twin Towers, Statue of Liberty and Washington D.C., but he greatly appreciated the "kindness, orderliness and general honesty of our culture," which has a strong foundation in God's Word. He said, "Dad, America is great because God is great." His principals, even if followed by pagans will improve any society and cause it to function at a much higher level.

As I stated above, there is no such thing as courtesy in banks, post offices, stores or other public services. The workers behind the counters are generally impolite and harsh (this tends to be the rule and not the exception). In the public sector and in government offices, not only are the workers rude, but also very inept and lazy. How often we have gone to the municipal building for some document (the Italian bureaucracy demands an ocean of documents even for the smallest operation), we are told to come back tomorrow because they either do not know how to do it, or just don't want to. The elderly and illiterate are especially abused in this manner.

Then there is the sense of honesty, integrity and fair play. If a mechanic fixes your car and you have a problem that he caused, often he will charge you to fix what he caused. We have found this with our newsletters. We took them to the stationary store to have copies made, they made a mistake which necessitated redoing over half of them (about 100 copies) and they charged us to right their wrong. There is no discussing this as the entire society functions at this level. My brother, it is a result of not having the powerful influence of the Word of God at work in society; it is totally absent. In addition to this, is the practice of not paying workers, sometimes for weeks, months and sometimes not at all. This is not rare at all, but something you can count on in many areas of employment, especially private work, but also in smaller factories. The same is true of customers charging food in the many small Mom and Pop stores and allowing the tab to run into the hundreds and even up to a thousand euros (dollars). Since these shop owners depend on local folks that live within walking distance of their small shops, they extend the credit out of the need for business. I must say in all honesty that this system is most prevalent in the poorer southern part of Italy.

The Roman Church still extends a tremendous influence over society, even if it is not the "State" church any more. She rules social life from processions and large outdoor masses to the constant ringing of church bells announcing the mass, funerals, marriages and religious festivals. They march through our small (6-8 feet wide) streets with band blaring and carrying banners and statues. When you consider 3 priests and 5 or 6 nuns in constant movement in a small village of 8000 people, you can imagine their constant presence reminding folks of the influence of the church. All babies are baptized, all people are married and buried in the church. When our grandson was born, an old women asked our son Josh if they were going to baptize him. Josh said, No, we do not baptize babies. The woman informed him that they had to. Josh asked why, and the women said, "to please the village." Not playing the religion game here is a grave social crime and is punishable by great family pressure, anger and often even shunning. This is the main reason that it is so hard, not to convince people of their need of Jesus, but for them to become members of the church. Fear and intimidation are the mightiest weapons the Roman church ever had in her arsenal. This soulish behavior rules southern Italian society.

As one looks at history, we see the Italian people excelling in the arts. One reason is because this is the only area the church allowed them to excel in. Mathematics and science often contradicted church teaching so the popes kept those folks under their watchful eyes....In fact, we do not see many great men and women excelling outside of the arts in Italian history. Only those who left the confines of the popes found fertile ground to allow their creativity and skills to flourish. This oppression still exists today as a lumbering bureaucratic dinosaur that merits extinction, still crushes all in its path through the culture and social system that IT created over so many centuries.

Let me conclude with a word about the oppression of the people. The church has taught for centuries basically that God really loves the poor and is sympathetic towards them. So the natural inclination was and is to give much to the coffers of Rome and we have a very poor society here in southern Italy (compared with the rest of western Europe)...

I do know that there is sin in every nation, but I must say, that my wife and I have not seen such gross sin in such a small village. Alcoholism, drug use, prostitution and adultery are rampant. Husbands beat their wives and children in such a way that would cause you to gasp for air. When women clean houses for people, in many cases it is expected that they will also provide other service for the master of the house. Blasphemy and bad language are as prevalent with the women as with the men, not to mention the children. They curse not only the Lord, but their saints and Mary as well.

We were raised in Washington, NJ, a town of 8000, and we did not see such things. The difference is that Rome never has had the opportunity to rule and ruin as it has in Italy and the other nations that have been governed by the popes or their lieges. I do not share these things with you to cut down the people of Italy or their culture, but only to share with you what Romanism has done to a people that were directly under her control. Even in the evangelical church there is no unity or love between the churches, be they Baptist, Salvation Army or Pentecostal. There are only about 500,000 evangelicals, 0.05% of the Italian population. The spirit of Rome rules and dominates even today and let us not, as you said, believe that she has changed. I often tell our people and even during street preaching, that if the Roman Church should again rule Italy, I, as an evangelical pastor, would quickly be executed. I truly believe that. She merely tolerates us, but in reality despises both the Bible believing churches, not to mention democracy, as do the Moslems.

Thank you my dear brother for allowing me to share these things with you. Perhaps it will serve only to reinforce what you already know to be true. May the Lord bless and keep and guide you in all your ways.

Your brother and sister in S. Italy,
Chuck and Ariel R., (senisemission@inwind.it)

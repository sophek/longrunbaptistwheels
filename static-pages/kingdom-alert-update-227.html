************************************************
NEW YEARS' EVE PROPHECY WATCH, 2004
************************************************

Let us begin tonight. Look in Luke 21. This is the text I want your to
remember. If you leave here tonight and you remember Luke 21, and you
think of the Second Coming, and you are driving down the road, and you are
looking around, and you are thinking that the Lord must be coming back
soon. Go back and look at Luke chapter 21. And you read that chapter.
Commit that text to memory. Please bow your heads with me.

Dear Holy Father, we give You thanks today, and ask God, this evening,
that You would just please bless this message. God I am nothing. And You
have saved us and You want to make us into glorious servants for You
Father. I thank you God that we have a future; that we are saved in
eternity. And I pray that these words will not be despised because of the
vessel. But Lord, this Holy Bible, which you have given, may it be
preached tonight. Do something with it God, I pray, and I know You will,
in Jesus' name. Amen.

If you will notice now, in Luke 21, verse 11. It says:

Luke 21:11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from
heaven.
25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars;
and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the
waves roaring;

This means earthquakes will be in many different places where they were
not found before. We have the earthquake that just hit. I did not include
the documentation, because it is not going to be the main topic of my
study tonight. But I think they have that in the earthquake in Iran,
perhaps 50,000 have died! One second they are alive, and in the next
second they are dead, or they are dying. I have a list of the great
earthquakes of the 20th century. They are increasing. They are
multiplying. People are dying. Now the Tribulation period has not arrived
yet. When the rapture happens and some Christians disappear, that's when
all of the earthquakes (mentioned in Luke 21) are actually going to begin
to occur. What we are seeing right now is the "building up" for what is
soon to be. We have pestilences. We have a flu epidemic. When you can hear
things rustling behind the curtain. When you can begin to hear the actors
and actresses walking on stage, and everything being moved around, you
know the curtain is about to open! Verse 25 says, "there shall be signs in
the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of
nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring." Every year I
give you a list of the great weather disasters. I document that it is
getting hotter and hotter every year, and in many places records are
breaking. It is getting hotter and hotter, and the Bible says in
Revelation 16, that an angel is going pour out his vial upon the sun. And
it will scorch men with fire! That's what the Bible says. And you may say,
"I just want to PARTY!" I want to LEAVE a fundamental church. I just want
to RELAX." Well, you go relax. But it will get hotter and hotter. And as
you relax, you just remember that every year, if the Lord does not come
back, people are going to increasingly curse God because of the heat. You
say, "Well, I'll just leave Texas." Friend, you can't leave TEXAS. Every
place will be TEXAS!

2 Thessalonians 2:4. The Antichrist:

2 Thessalonians 2:4...so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
shewing himself that he is God.

The Antichrist is going to sit in the TEMPLE of God (that is the temple at
Jerusalem). You cannot have a temple for him to sit in without the nation
of Israel being restored. Our Bible tells us in Revelation 11, and in many
other places (Matthew 24, etc.) it shows us that the Jews must return to
their land. But we are living in the days of sleepy Christians. Have you
ever heard when Jesus said, If the things (signs) which have been done
among you had been done in Sodom THEY WOULD HAVE REPENTED LONG AGO!!
Friend, I am going to tell you something. If the signs that have occurred
in YOUR day, had occurred 200, 300, 400 years ago, there wouldn't have
been a backslider among them! The Bible tells us that Israel must be
restored as a nation. In 1947, Israel was restored as a nation. And it has
been a nation ever since this time. Twenty years later, when a man,
according to the Bible, goes to war, Jerusalem was controlled by Israel.
Jerusalem has been a burdensome stone, as Zechariah predicted. "What are
we going to do about Jerusalem?" There is conflict. The Muslims hate the
Jews. What about the Middle East?" The Bible says the Middle East would be
the center of turmoil, and now it is. And you haven't seen nothing yet.
Notice, Thomas Newton, the great Bible prophecy teacher in 1760 said:

"....the Jews shall...be restored to their own land."
(Thomas Newton, 1760)

Oh how people mocked this type of literal interpretation! People love to
interpret Bible prophecy figuratively instead of literally. People love to
interpret God's COMMANDS figuratively too! Did you know that? William
Burgh, in 1833 said:

"...the greater portion of the Jewish nation will return to their land in
a state of unbelief... they WILL REBUILD THEIR CITY AND THEIR TEMPLE,
and...God will choose that time to consummate His judgments on them..."
(William Burgh, 1833)

You see Israel in their land right now. Do you know what is going to
happen very soon? They are going to be persecuted. Why? Because most are
rejecting the Saviour. Friend, God will do anything He can to try to get
you saved before you go to eternal fire. God wants the Jews to receive
Him. But God can't LIE. God cannot be unjust. God has to save you on the
basis of the Blood of Jesus. Mathematically two plus two is four. God
can't just slide something under the rug. If you don't receive the BLOOD
COVERING, God can do nothing. He cannot lie. God cannot conclude that two
plus two equals three. And He cannot say that a sinner is saved and washed
clean, unless there has been a Blood payment! Friend, He wants you to
receive salvation! Robert Govett, in 1861, said:

"The temple in Jerusalem will be yet rebuilt by the Jews in unbelief, and
be the scene of wickedness greater than has ever appeared..."
(Robert Govett, 1861)
 
In 1947, the words of these great men were fulfilled. You say, "How did
they know this would come to pass, when everyone else laughed them to
scorn?" They knew it because of LITERAL INTERPRETATION. Whatever this Book
literally says will come to pass, will come to pass. Though everybody else
is dead, the words of this Book will be fulfilled.

In the past few years, we have been watching the race toward the Mark of
the Beast. Notice the next section:

RACING TOWARD THE MARK...AND TOTAL SURVEILLANCE!

There will be a mark, a chip, or something like it, that will be IN the
hand, or IN the forehead, and that thing will be able to control all the
financial transactions in the world! Back in A.D. 90 (or thereabouts), a
man named John, John the Apostle, wrote down some words (and people have
been struggling with them ever since, and we are starting to understand
some details now). John wrote by inspiration of God:

A.D. 90:  " And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,
that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as
would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth
all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark
in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or
sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number
of his name.
(The Holy Bible, Revelation 13:15-17)

How do these diabolical authorities KNOW if everyone in the world is
worshipping the image? According to the Book of Revelation, there will
come a time when authorities will have TOTAL SURVEILLANCE capabilities.
Remember all the books like George Orwell's "1984" etc. that talked about
the all-seeing-eye of Big Brother? And people say, "Oh what a prophet this
man was." But JOHN in A.D. 90 predicted a time of total surveillance on
planet earth. You can look in Revelation 13. You can look back in
Revelation 11, where it says that the Two Witnesses are slain, and all the
world views their dead bodies in the streets of Jerusalem. They "make
merry" and send gifts, and celebrate the decapitation of these men of God.
And people wondered, before TV, how such a thing could ever be fulfilled
literally. But YOU do not wonder about such a thing, do you? Friend, we
are RACING toward the Mark and total surveillance. The Bible teaches that
there is a day coming when you will walk up to Wal-Mart, and all you want
is some little, basic item, and as you go to pay, they will say, "I am
sorry. We do not accept CASH, Sir." But you will say, "But I have a gold
piece here. If you will just give me some food." All the cows and the
pasture land has disappeared. Personal farming is against the law. But
they will not accept your jewelry. Cash is worthless. But they tell you,
"If you will but pass your hand across the scanner, we will be glad to
give you whatever you desire." (Of course, in actuality you will probably
be scanned when you walk through he door). You will not be able to buy or
sell unless you have the MARK. If you do not have the Mark and you will
not worship the Beast, you will be slain. The Bible says to watch and pray
that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which shall
come to pass (Luke 21:36). Do you want to be here during that time? Notice
the following literal Bible interpreters:
 
1843:  "Is the Mark literal? Yes...How can it be any other than a literal
mark?...It is something which is to be shown in the market..." (Robert
Govett)

1865: "As masters of old time branded their slaves, and as owners of stock
brand and mark their cattle, so are the people [to be] branded..." (Joseph
Seiss)

1919: "In that day men will doubtless prefer to have the mark on the back
of their right hand so it can be readily seen in the act of signing
checks..." (Clarence Larkin)

1930's: "Only those who worship the beast and take his mark will be
allowed to sell.... it will be a day of marks and numbers on every hand,
that is everywhere."
(E. F. Webber)

Today, we have driver's license numbers, social security numbers,
registration, account numbers, EVERY type of number you can imagine! But
notice, as we move into modern times, things begin to pick up speed!:

February, 2000: "Meet the 'Digital Angel' - from Hell -  ...The product is
billed as a versatile transceiver that can send and receive data - and
which can be implanted in humans...When implanted in the body, the device
is powered electromagnetically through the movement of muscles..." (WND)

August, 2000: "What was considered science-fiction fantasy only a few
years ago is now everyday reality - sub-dermal computer chips used for
identification and location purposes. While today, the use of these
devices is predominantly restricted to animals, there are grand plans for
multiple human uses in the very near future...It's not going to go away."
(WND)

May, 2002: "First Humans to Receive ID Chips Technology...Eight people
will be injected with silicon chips Friday, making them scannable just
like a jar of peanut butter in the supermarket checkout line..." (Times)

Now let's notice what has transpired THIS PAST YEAR:

September, 2003:  "...New York Cityâ€™s first subdermal VeriChip 'chipping'
procedure was performed yesterday (September 24, 2003) at the Company's
lower Manhattan Authorized VeriChip Center. A journalist at a
technology-related trade publication decided to Get Chipped in researching
an upcoming article....The brief outpatient 'chipping' procedure lasts
just a few minutes....The standard location of the microchip is in the
triceps area between the elbow and the shoulder of the RIGHT ARM...."

RIGHT arm. It is getting close isn't it? Time Magazine, just a few months
ago, said:

September 22, 2003: "The See-It-All Chip - Radio-frequency identification
- is about to change your life..." (Time Magazine)

September 25, 2003: "In Your Cereal? Retailers plan to use tiny
transmitters to record your purchases. What else will they find out? You
can't buy a can of soup or a box of detergent today without also acquiring
one of those ubiquitous pieces of black and white stripes: the bar code.
Yet the introduction of the bar code, more than 30 years ago, wasn't
exactly seamless. The first coded product-a 10-pack of Wrigley's gum-was
purchased from a Marsh's supermarket in Ohio in 1974; the gum now sits in
the Smithsonian. What's less known, according to industry lore, is that
another early shopper asked what the scanner was, got nervous and walked
out. History has long since forgotten her objection, and today bar codes
save the food industry $17 billion per year, or 50 times the savings
initially forecast. THOSE ARE USEFUL facts for the companies seeking to
replace bar codes with a controversial new technology called RFID...Kevin
Ashton, who heads the MIT Auto-ID Center, which is developing standards
for RFID, says that 'for the first time, companies are starting to imagine
using RFID on a large scale.'"
(Newsweek)

These are embedded CHIPS in products that can be scanned from a distance:

October 15, 2003: "Marks & Spencer Moves Forward with RFID
Trials....Starting
this week, Marks & Spencer's High Wycombe store will offer men's suits,
shirts and ties carrying large lilac hang tags that are equipped with RFID
devices...."

They are already placing chips IN PEOPLE:

October, 2003: "A Mexican company has launched a service to implant
microchips in children as an anti-kidnapping device....the Mexican
distributor...is marketing the device as an emergency ID under its new
VeriKid program....The company envisions placing walk-through scanners -
similar to metal-detector portals used in airports - in malls, bus
stations and other areas...." (Wired.com)

In previous years we have noticed the technology arising to embed chips in
people. It was useful, since it stored medical records, etc. It can be
scanned. But NOW this SUBDERMAL technology is being marketed for FINANCIAL
usages. It took only three years!:

November, 2003:  "...Scott R. Silverman, in his speech today at the ID
World 2003 in Paris, France, revealed the Company's newest SUBDERMAL RFID
solution called VeriPay....The VeriPay announcement came just a few days
after a USA Today article (November 17, 2003) about emerging technologies
highlighted one of the major limitations of using RFID technology for
payment and credit transactions. After discussing various potential
formats for RFID payment systems, including cards, earrings or pens, the
USA Today article stated: 'Still, experts note that one big hurdle remains
for RFID systems: security. Lose your RFID-enabled card or earring, and
someone else could easily use it to run up charges - especially if no
signature is required.'....VeriPay brings to consumers the benefits of
fast and reliable RFID technology along with the security of a subdermal
format. In announcing VeriPay to ID World delegates, Mr. Silverman
expressed his belief that VeriPay has enormous marketplace potential..."
(ADSX.com)

Notice the big hurdle! Security! What will they stick the chip in? An
ear-ring? A pen? You don't have to sign anything. But now they seeking to
unite this convenience IN THE BODY!:

November 10, 2003: "...VeriChip Corporation, has received a purchase order
for 400 VeriChips and 34 handheld scanners from its exclusive distributor
for Russia and Switzerland....Over the five years covered by the
agreement, the minimum purchase requirement is 51,000 VeriChips and 2,600
proprietary scanners in order to maintain exclusive distribution rights in
the stipulated countries." (ADSX.com)

Notice the following cover story from National Geographic magazine:

November, 2003: "Watching You - The world of high-tech surveillance - The
future is here, where cameras can film you wherever you go, where your
cell phone can signal exactly where you are, where one glance can reveal
exactly who you are....We are hurtling toward constant electronic scrutiny
- of the enemy and of ourselves....There are new threats in a post-9/11
world....Cameras are becoming so omnipresent that all Britons should
assume their behavior outside the home is monitored....Superman's no
longer the only one with X-ray vision....New back-scatter X-ray machines
look through thin surfaces like truck walls to produce detailed images of
what lies behind them....What George Orwell did not prophesy in his novel
1984 was just how pervasive surveillance would be in free societies....A
560-acre complex of satellite dishes in Menwith Hill, England, run by the
United States' National Security Angency may be the largest surveillance
station in the world. What's unclear is the station's connection with a
program called Echelon....NSA is quiet on the matter, but outside experts
say the agency's supercomputers scan millions of ordinary phone calls and
e-mails an hour....Virtual strip search....If you don't like taking off
your shoes at the airport security check, hold on tight: The machine shown
to the right makes you naked...." (National Geographic, Cover story)

This information is not from some strange website. This is National
Geographic. Not only will they SEE you, they will see you NAKED if they
want to; if you are in the right place! This brings us to this month:

December 13, 2003: "Bug devices track officials at summit - Officials who
attended a world Internet and technology summit in Switzerland last week
were unknowingly bugged, said researchers who attended the forum. Badges
assigned to attendees of the World Summit on the Information Society were
affixed with radio-frequency identification chips (RFIDs)....RFID chips
track a person's movement in 'real time.'...."
(Washington Times)

December 20, 2003: "A free big brother in every pack - Spy chips that can
trigger sneak mugshots of consumers and have prompted buyer boycotts of
major retailers overseas have arrived in Australia....Gillette bought 500
million of the chips in January....The giant Wal-Mart retailer in the US
is ordering its suppliers to insert chips in all products by
2005....MasterCard and American Express have already [tested] the
'contactless' credit cards for small transactions at thousands of US
restaurants, fast food outlets and pharmacies. Some of the cards are
shaped like keyrings and do not have to be taken out of the wallet...."
(SMH.AU.com)

We have an amazing Bible. You have a Bible that predicted a day of total
surveillance; a day when an event can be captured in real time and viewed
anywhere on planet earth; a day when no financial transaction can be made
throughout the world without the sub-dermal Mark.

This is not a time for backsliding! This is not a time for playing around.
This is not a time for playing games. We will next notice that Babylon is
reviving!:

BABYLON REVIVING

We have seen Israel restored as a nation. We have seen Mark of the Beast
technology coming out of the woodwork. And next we will see Babylon
reviving. Let's go back to Isaiah 13, seven hundred years or so before
Jesus was born:
 
760-698 B.C. : "1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did
see. 10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not
give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the
moon shall not cause her light to shine.17 Behold, I will stir up the
Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they
shall not delight in it. 19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty
of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah.
20 It shall never be inhabited....(Holy Bible, Isaiah 13)

The Medes are the modern Kurds. Many are Iran today! Babylon will become
the glory of the world. It has never been judged as described in Isaiah.
Notice:

1811: Described by Rich as containing six or seven thousand inhabitants.
(B. Newton)

1833: Mentioned by Major Skinner, with population of twelve thousand
inhabitants.
(B. Newton)

1865: "I conclude, then, that such a great commercial city, different from
all that now exist, will yet be, and that it will be old Babylon rebuilt."
(Joseph A. Seiss, Lectures on the Apocalypse)

These men were laughed to scorn by scoffers, and men of the figurative
school of interpretation:

1888: "May not the vanished city [Babylon] also re-appear?....We conclude,
then, that the case of Babylon will be similar to [that] of
Jerusalem...and that she will re-appear in time to do and to suffer all
that God has foretold...It seems, therefore, on every account likely that
we may presently hear of projects to restore Babylon..." (G. H. Pember)

1925: "The physical phenomena described in Isaiah 13:10-13 have not been
in any history of Babylon's past, and as they take place at the time of
its judgment, the city must be in existence, therefore it must have been
rebuilt." (F. E. Marsh)

 In 1947, Israel was restored as a nation. The stage was set for future
prophecy to be fulfilled. Just 40 or so years later, we begin to hear of
the restoration of Babylon:

1989: "Nebuchadnezzar's Revenge: Iraq Flexes Its Muscles by Rebuilding
Babylon..."     (San Francisco Chronicle, April)

This was BIBLE language!:

1990:  "Today, thousands of workers are reconstructing the ancient city of
Babylon in the middle of the Iraqi desert....the new Babylon...will be the
city of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein...." (World Press Review,
February)

But how could it become a commercial city under Hussein? In a 2001
prophecy sermon I gave two scenarios, and stated that it was very probable
that we would go to war and capture Babylon. When you get out of bed
tomorrow in 2004, America is in control of BABYLON! And the nations of the
world will no doubt insure that it quickly becomes the great, world,
commercial center, just as it is described in Revelation 16 and 18
(Revelation 17 refers to Rome). We do not know the details such as WHO
will remain in control of Babylon. But we do know it will become the great
commercial center of the world. Now notice what is happening at this
moment. We have gone very far in only a couple of years!:

July, 2003: "CAMP BABYLON, Iraq - ...The second of six phone banks to be
constructed in Iraq was completed at Camp Babylon in time for troops to
celebrate July 4...." (Marinecorps.com)

Have you ever heard of "Camp Babylon"? It is there now:

September, 2003: "Seabee Ingenuity Brings Ancient History To Life - When
Navy Seabees attached to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force...advanced
into the ancient biblical city of Babylon at the beginning of Operation
Iraqi Freedom...they arrived to find the city's museum and its ruins
looted and damaged....After Marines secured the city to protect it from
further destruction, the Seabees built Camp Babylon around the ancient
city in order to protect one of history's most important archaeological
treasures....Builder 2nd Class Roger Hatcher is an avid model builder in
his hometown, Moorpark, Calif. He is known for his complex working model
ships that fire cannons by remote control. Naturally, his skill made him
the right man for the job of rebuilding the tower of Babel model. 'When we
got to Iraq, I thought I'd be working on hospitals and schools. To be able
to work on a historic site that people could look at and say, 'that's what
it was like,' was pretty rewarding,' said Hatcher." (www.news.navy.mil)

Do you really think that one of history's most important "archaeological
treasures" is going to sit over there without malls, shops, bowling
alleys, restaurants, movies, theaters, New-agers, etc.? Babylon was the
birthplace of occultism (Genesis 10-11). People will FLOCK over there to
invest once they know it is safe.

If the Lord does not come this year, and if we have another New Years' Eve
prophecy watch - it is not likely that we will - but if we do, you will
not believe what will happen in Babylon this year.

Almost all of the literal Bible interpreters thought that most of the
things we have been discussing would happen after the rapture. But all of
these things are being set in place. Things are getting ripe. The Devil is
getting crazier today. He exercises great wrath in the Tribulation period
because he knows his time is short. And this is why he is destroying, and
SEEKING TO DEVOUR people today! You say, "Why are so many people losing
their minds today?" Because the Devil is mad. The Bible says you better
stay in church (Hebrews 10:25). You better get as much of it as you can.
As you see that day approaching, you better watch and stay among God's
people. Get with the people who are on fire for God and who are watching,
and know that the Devil wants you to separated from them. Soon the time
will come when the first-fruit saints will be removed (Luke 21:36,
Rev.3:10). If you have a crop and the harvest is not far away, you will
still have much of it that is bit GREEN. Are you green Christian? Are you
immature for your spiritual age? Do you need some more training? Do you
need the hot sun of the Tribulation to ripen you unto holiness? But some
fruit will be ripe and ready to harvest, and as a farmer takes out his
first-fruits that are ripe, so will Jesus catch away some saints from this
earth. But you say, "Why are we still here? What hasn't the Tribulation
Period arrived?" It is because God is long-suffering:

THE LONGSUFFERING OF GOD

God is doing something. It is not lie nothing is occurring all around you.
America is in control of Babylon. The financial world and sub-dermal
technology are merging. Churches are filled with Christians going crazy.
We have never seen a day like this. The Bible says people will not ENDURE
sound doctrine. In churches around the world we hear that people are
saying, "I will not put up with this preaching." Many people will no
longer endure sound doctrine (2 Timothy 4). They are dropping, one by one.
Fundamental churches are saying, "We can't preach like this anymore." But
by God's grace, I do not intend to water down God's commandments. Pray for
me. Pray!

Notice how earlier Christians thought that Jesus would return around the
year 2000:

"The world was ordained to endure, AS ALL LEARNED MEN affirm and prove it
with Scripture, six thousand  years. Now, of that number there be past
five thousand five hundred and fifty-two (years); so that there is no more
left but four hundred and forty-eight."
(Hugh Latimer, 1490-1555)

"The great period of a thousand years...is yet to begin. Its commencement
is expected by THE MOST JUDICIOUS COMMENTATORS, at a time, near the year
2000."
(Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817)

They kept watching because they knew Jesus could come SUDDENLY (Mark
13:36) and cut the time short. The Lord predicted that His people would go
to sleep:

Matthew 25:5 While the bridegroom TARRIED, they all slumbered and slept.
6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go
ye out to meet him.

Are you getting spiritually sleepy Christian? Now that the year 2000 is
past, are you weary? Are you less and less concerned with spiritual
things? Less and less concerned with doctrine? Are you more concerned with
toys, trinkets, luxuries of this life, entertainment, fun, fun, fun and
shopping, while ignoring God's will? That is called going to sleep. Soon
the rapture is going to occur, but some are not ready. I pray you are
ready:

Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
delayeth his coming; 49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and
to eat and drink with the drunken; 50 The lord of that servant shall come
in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware
of, 51 And shall cut him asunder...

Many Christians are flocking to PRETERISM. They will not endure Bible
prophecy. A few years ago, most Christians had never heard of preterism.
They say all of Bible prophecy has already been fulfilled. But the Lord
teaches that this doctrine will lead to backsliding and sin. Party time!
They are coming out of the woodwork today. Do you like the backsliders? Do
you like the carnal folk? Do you like the folk who refuse to repent, who
have been alienated from their churches because of sin? Do you like to
flock around them? Notice this man began to "eat and drink with the
drunken."
Notice that Peter predicted the scoffers would arise:

2 Peter 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation.
5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
water:
6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of
ungodly men.
8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with
the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to repentance.

They are mocking us today. But Babylon is being rebuilt. So who is the
fool? Israel is restored. They said it would not happen. So who is the
fool? The Bible said there would be scoffers. Obviously, something had to
happen to create SCOFFING. If you watch, you will see that things are
getting closer. But the scoffers refuse to see these stage-setting signs.
They are willingly ignorant. If you watch, it will keep you excited about
the Lord's coming. You will say, "It is time for me to get serious about
soul winning. It is time for me to get serious about God's commandments.
It is time for me to get right with God."

There were four "days" from Adam to Christ. The Jew rested on the seventh
day. It is the Millennial rest (Hebrews 4). "But why hasn't the rapture
occurred?" Maybe there are backsliders who need to get right with God. God
is merciful. But many who God is giving mercy to, are the very ones
mocking the Lord for not coming yet! Notice that Peter says they are
ignorant about the flood (2 Peter 3:5). In 1 Peter 3, he writes:

1 Peter 3:20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing...

According to our Bible, you can go back to the time of Noah and find God
WAITING before He flooded the world. The same pattern will occur in the
last days before God burns the world by His fire. Notice the mercy God
gave to Noah's world. God told that world that He will NOT continue to be
patient FOREVER! God is not eternally patient. He will NOT always continue
to wait for you to repent and get right with Him. But God told that wicked
world, "I'll give you 120 years of mercy." He extended some time:

Genesis 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years.

M. R. DeHaan writes:

"We believe that God revealed to Enoch that the coming of the flood would
correspond to the death of his son [Methuselah]. As long as Methuselah was
alive, the judgment would not come, but when he was taken from the world,
then it would happen. The life of Methuselah became the measure of God's
longsuffering and patience before the flood came...Quoting Mr. Pink, we
read as follows: 'The name Methuselah strongly implies that Enoch had
received a revelation from God. The name Methuselah signifies, 'When he is
dead it shall be sent; i.e. the deluge'....'....the flood came in the same
year and the very same day of Methuselah's death....Noah was six hundred
years old when the flood came, and Methuselah was 969 years old at the
same time....We may therefore assume that God also added 120 years to the
life of Methuselah, to permit the flood to be postponed for the same
period of time. Normally, Methuselah should have died at the age of 849
years, but the longsuffering of God WAITED and added an additional 120
years to Methuselah's life." (M. R. DeHaan, 1963)

Why was Methuselah the oldest man who ever lived? His extended life
signified God's mercy. People asked, "Methuselah, how long are you going
to live?" Soon, they figured he would just keep on living. They presumed
upon God's mercy. They scoffed at Noah's preaching. But the day Methuselah
died, God destroyed the world! Don't you ever forget that Methuselah DIED.
And there will come a day, if you continue to resist God, that His mercy
will cease:

Genesis 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
years: and he died. [930 divided by 120 = 7.75]

We don't live hundreds of years today:

Psalms 90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour
and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. [70 divided by 7.75 =
9.03 years]

Therefore, we should not expect 120 years of mercy. I am not telling you
that you have nine more years before the rapture. I am telling you that if
the Lord does not come this year, it is because of His mercy. It does mean
that we need to forget about the Second Coming and pretend that it
occurred in A.D. 70! But God may come tonight. There is one sense in which
we want Him to come as quick as possible. We want His Kingdom and His
righteousness on this earth. Thank God for His mercy toward us. But don't
presume upon it! Watch!:

Mark 13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the
house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the
morning:
36 Lest coming SUDDENLY he find you sleeping.

Revelation 16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth,
and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
Where are your garments? You need spiritual garments, and you need literal
holy garments. Let's bow our heads. If somebody wants to come forward and
bow their knee to God, this is the time. Don't despise this church. These
men of old, years ago, they saw some things. But friend, I have a Bible in
my hands. It is a King James Bible. And I know what is says. It says that
Jesus is going to come soon. So let's wake up!! Let's get serious about
God, serious about church, serious about your life, your marriage, your
children. If you can sit and read and hear these things, and you will not
repent, you can't repent! God have mercy on your soul. Children, I am
going to tell you something, as these folks are praying. All the children
in this room, you better get right with God and you better stay right.
Life is not funny. Death is not funny. We are not down here to party. You
better learn to love Jesus right now, because you have serious days that
are coming. You better start right now practicing to stay away from the
perverse things of this world. All heads bowed. If there is somebody here
and you want me to pray for you, please raise your hand. "Dear holy God,
will you please, if you give us a new year, please put a blessing upon
these people, Father. Let their hearts turn toward You and Your people.
Keep them in Thy grace, please Lord. Keep them from evil. I pray, in
Jesus' name. Amen."

-FAILURE CONCERNING THE GREAT COMMISSION

-THE STONY GROUND: A PRIMARY REASON SOME CHRISTIANS DO NOT GROW IN KNOWLEDGE OR HOLINESS.

1. Some of our recent, online sermon titles are as follows:

"Growing in Biblical Modesty" (Examines the Biblical "dress code" for men and women, as it pertains to modesty).

"The Mind Under a Shoebox" (Examines the modern fall into mysticism, even in Christian churches).

2. Also, join with us by video (online) for our "live" services, every Lord's Day.

3. We also thank you for prayers for our Kingdom-Rewards Conference (2009). We had a blessed time of fellowship and preaching. Conference sermons should be online in a few days. Our ladies came together to provide three meals a day, and we were so thankful for those who came to spend a few days with us. We met some new friends, and rejoiced in the fear of the Lord with some old ones. In thinking about how all the messages and testimonies came together, I would have to say that the "theme" that was brought out was that temporary discipline (now, and at the Judgment Seat) is a strong proof of God's love. He will faithfully do what He has warned. In this age of passive, spineless, easily manipulated fathers, we can be sure that our Heavenly Father will not forget to reward us, good or bad, for our behaviour. 

4. "COOKING KINGDOM STYLE," RECIPE BOOK.

This is a helpful recipe book by the ladies at Kingdom Baptist. It showcases Biblical foods (and foods in the Biblical families). Learn how to cook with healthy sugars and oils, and nutritious Bible-based foods, or just get some great ideas! From "barley coffee" to cooking with palm sugar, this book is beautifully put together, with pictures, and some very tasty recipes.

5. Congratulations to Brother Phillip Stancil who will soon be ordained out of Faith Baptist Church
in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He preached an excellent message at our conference on Saul's life, as it pictures some things pertaining to the Judgment Seat of Christ.

 

FAILURE CONCERNING THE GREAT COMMISSION

Matthew 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

It would surely be a great blessing if Christians would obey this Great Commission! Certainly we have a partial obedience to this - at least in some churches. We have some churches who will go out and witness for Jesus, and tell sinners what the Lord taught in John 3, John 6, and elsewhere. In other words, they will preach to sinners that they must be born again through faith (belief) alone. But then there is a sudden ceasing in their obedience. I do not mean that they merely fail to make disciples. They fail to make disciples with the Lord's words that he commanded His discples to teach to new discples! Where is the rest of the Lord's words? The Commission given by Jesus was to teach them to observe (not just to know) "all things whatosever" He had taught His disciples! These things are preserved for us in the Gospels! Unless the Lord has plainly changed something He had earlier commanded His disciples (as in Matthew 10:5, 28:19), He expects us to obey it and teach others to obey it!

Have you ever gone through the Gospels to see how much is left out in modern soul winning and discipleship? Some churches exist for 50 years and never warn disciples as Jesus warned them in the first few days of their salvation! No wonder churches have turned into coffee houses and theaters. The Lord taught new disciples (baby Christians) in His Sermon on the Mount. He warned them not to call each other names, without a godly cause, or they will face judgment, and even hell (Matthew 5:22). Go through the Matthew 5-7, and notice how all of these things that Jesus taught His disciples (i.e. children of the Father, light of the world, salt of the earth) are barely mentioned by many modern preachers (see Matthew 5:30).

Then notice how in Matthew 10:27-30, the motivation Jesus gives for preaching and teaching without fear is almost NEVER taught to new Christians today. No wonder they are so timid.

Then, in Matthew 18:1-3, Jesus taught His converted disciples that they needed a further conversion in humility, or they will not enter the Kingdom. Believers today are never taught this truth. Then He warns His disciples again about cutting off anything that offends them, so they will not miss the kingdom and go to hell during it (18:8-9). There is no doubt whom He is addressing. Then read the rest of Matthew 18 and see how the Lord teaches Peter, directly, a warning about forgiveness. How often is His warning to Peter in Matthew 18:35 taught to modern believers? There has been an utter failure in carrying out the Great Commission. It has become the Great Ommission. This is the real problem. Who will obey the Great Commission? To tell modern believers what Jesus taught His disciples goes against modern tradition. It will get you kicked out of the club. They do not like the Lord words to His disciples. They think they can improve upon them. They think they can get sinners saved and keep them holy by keeping them busy, or entertained, or by some other method.

We could continue through Matthew 24 and 25, and Mark 9 and Luke 12, and many other Scriptures, where the Lord taught His disciples the very things He expected them to teach others who have believed. (Some deceivers like to pretend that the Epistles are the only foundation today, when the Epistles do not even reveal the doctrine of the Virgin Birth. They are building and elaborating upon the cornestone of the Gospels, and they do not supplant them).

But as long as this failure comtinues, people will keep "playing church." Please do not say that you are fulfilling the Great Commission if you are intent on disobeying it, or in only obeying a quarter of it. Please never quote it as applicable to us today. Perhaps it would be better to embrace Hyper-dispensationalism or some other "ism," and pretend Matthew 28 does not apply to modern believers (even though this is an absurd position, in light of the Lord's last words in 28:20). But please do not pretend to obey it, when you leave out 75 percent of the Lord's warnings and commands to His own disciples - simply because you have embraced a tradition of man that must ignore these things.

Can there ever be true revival as long as the Lord's Great Commission to His church is disobeyed, or only partially fulfilled? Shall we teach what Jesus taught His disciples before they were saved, yet neglect the many words He taught them after they believed? The Lord commanded His disciples to teach "whatsoever" He had taught them. The early Christians, for a few centuries, obeyed this Commission. Let us therefore get back to obeying it, before our time runs out, and we will be judged a slothful or foolish stewards of these precious truths revealed by Jesus to His disciples.



THE STONY GROUND: A PRIMARY REASON SOME CHRISTIANS DO NOT GROW IN KNOWLEDGE OR HOLINESS

Jesus warns that it is possible to understand the "word of the Kingdom," and then later, have this seed (understanding) taken away from our minds. The candle is put out. This refers to the truth of how to enter the Millennial Kingdom (1 Corinthians 15: 24), and reign with Jesus, and the unpopular warnings that accompany this truth:

Matthew 13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom...
20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

We see here that the man once rejoiced in these things - but later, he spits up the truth when he feels the heat.  

The Scriptures reveal that one of the most important keys to understanding, and growing in godliness, is not fearing what other people will say or do to us. Notice:

1 Peter 4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

What is this "armor" that Peter speaks of? It is mental armor. It is the mind of Christ. It is thinking about things the way Jesus thought about them when He was on earth. Jesus was willing to "suffer in the flesh," even to blood. Why did He suffer? From man's side, because He was righteous. He suffered for His holiness, for His stand for truth, and for His stand against evil. The more we grow in truth and righteousness, the more we will arouse the wrath of those around us. Persecution is often a proof that we have ceased from certain popular sins, and old friends think we are now "strange": 

Philippians 1:28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

1 John 3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

2 Timothy 3:12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

Proverbs 29:27...he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

We need to arm ourselves with the "values" of Jesus. It is the mind that says that we are not going live to the will of man, but to the will of God, regardless of the human consequences. But why is it part of our armor? Why is it a protection? Because, when we care what people think, and we are unwilling to displease men, we are going to fall!:

Galatians 1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

Courage to go against the carnal taunts of others is a major mental weapon of our holiness:

John 5:41 I receive not honour from men.
44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?

You cannot grow in truth if you are afraid of what people will think. Will you be harassed? Will you lose friends? Will you lose meetings or opportunities? Will people call you names? This type of thinking will blind us to truth, and will also hinder us from growing in righteousness:

John 12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

This fear of what others will think about us plays a bigger role than many realize. Many Christians work hard to be thought of as "cool" or "hip" or "with it." Their greatest fear is to be branded a "Pharisee." Yet, they have little fear in being labeled a liberal Sadducee, a Demas, an Epicure, or a lukewarm Laodicean!

Indeed, people will stare and call you strange if you dress modestly in these careless times. But they will also stare and wonder if you walk into a store with well-behaved children! Good children are a strange sight to see in days when most children run around like wild monkeys. In some of these things that we do that are different, we may find some compliments. In other things, we may often find ridicule:

1 Peter 4:4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

It is for this reason that the battle begins in the mind. Will we arm ourselves with the proper outlook, or will we hinder ourselves from ever growing in truth and holiness? The proper mental outlook is to care little about the opinions of men:

Acts 24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

Peter has already explained this important aspect of our armor to the Christian women:

1 Peter 3:4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

Notice how, in verse 6, what we are thinking inwardly is an important part of whether we stand or fall. Our mental esteem of the opinion of the majority of men holds the key to whether we cease from sin, or we continue to run with the crowd. If we get amazed with fear about what people will think or say about us, we will never grow. We will be insecure, nervous, selfish and carnal:

Philippians 2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

The Lord had a mind that did not care about His "reputation" when it concerned pleasing His Father:

Hebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

Jesus "despised" the shame they would heap upon Him for serving the Father. He was not afraid to "offend" people, when necessary (Matthew 15:12). Jesus was of such a mind that He was willing to die at the hands of men, in order to please God. Surely, we can endure a few slanders and whispers! When we are afraid of the shame, we will not endure anything for God. We will faint at the pressure. But when we have such a mind that is not afraid with amazement; when we have a mind that considers this shame a very little thing, we will be in a place where we can grow in doctrine and holiness.

But there are few who are willing to be outside "the camp":

Hebrews 13:13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.

There was a time when it took this proper mental outlook to restore premillennialism in the mainstream (as in the first 300 years of Christian history, where Justin Martyr said that all who are Biblical Christians embrace it). Men like Joseph Mede, in the 17th century, endured great ridicule. They were called "Jewish," etc. Later, in the 19th century, when some bold men restored the literalism and futurism of the Book of Revelation (as in the first 300 years of Christian history), they were branded as "Jesuits," "literalist fanatics," etc. Future generations of saints often readily accept as "fundamental" the things that previous generations had to bring forth in the midst of great persecution.

The danger is when it becomes obvious that the new, self-appointed gatekeepers of the new "conservative" generation have become stale, reckless and in many ways apostate. To revive things, we must re-examine the foundations. We must make sure nothing important has been left behind in the last few decades. But it will be impossible to fix anything as long as we shake at a falling leaf!:

Proverbs 28:1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.

Sly bullies know how to make a lot of frightening noise. The mind of Christ will arm us against their taunts. Who cares what they say? Who are they? Let us never be ashamed of the words of Christ! He is at the right hand of God. He was ready to judge the quick and the dead 2000 years ago! He is certainly ready today! And judgment must begin at the house of God. Let the scorners and mockers rail against the fear of God then! Let them rail against holiness and standards then!

Jesus had a mind that did not care what people said about Him. There was a time when even His relatives and childhood friends slandered Him in their misunderstanding (Mark 3:21). Therefore, when we set our minds to not care too much what others say, we will be armed with a great weapon:

2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

Matthew 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.
28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

Mark 8:38 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

If the Lord despised it as an "adulterous and sinful generation" in the first century, what is it now that perilous times have come (2 Timothy 3)? Should we care too much about what others think when the Bible says they will not endure sound doctrine, but will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears?

Do you care too much what others think? Are you afraid to be counter-culture? Are you afraid to  be modest? Afraid to separate yourself from the TV prime-time sewer? I tuned out back in the days of the O.J. Simpson trial and have never come back. What a refreshing blessing. In hearing a few radio reports about the Michael Jackson funeral fanfare, I rejoice to know I became "counter culture" years ago, and therefore got to miss it all! I became "strange." Who cares? I would rather do things that people have done as "normal" for about 6000 years, even if it means I will be called "strange" in these perilous, apostate times!

Are you afraid to teach the warnings of Jesus to His disciples? This is no time for effeminate sissies. Who are you trying to please? It is time for us to have some men with some backbone stand up and restore holiness and the fear of God. We have had enough people-pleasing, pastoral politicians. I don't apologize for writing this. Better get it straight now, before you take your last breath or meet Jesus in the air. Imagine! People are afraid to be called a "heretic" for teaching what JESUS plainly taught us:

Revelation 2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

Revelation 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.
17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

Matthew 5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

Let's quit caring so much about our "reputation," and let's trust God to defend us. If we do not heed these warnings, our hearts will become hardened into the stony ground. And we will begin to smite our fellowservants who stand for the word of the Kingdom. We will be ashamed of them:

1 John 3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

In other words, we can have a confident expectation that we will inherit the Millennial Kingdom at the Judgment Seat if we see that we are loving the brethren who are standing for truth and righteousness.

            "They say Christ made wine, but He certainly would not have made fermented wine. He made nothing rotten. Wine in the Bible when used in the right sense speaks of the pure blood of the grape. The same Saviour who throughout the Bible urges people not to drink would certainly not create something to contradict His own word and ruin the men He came to save!...They say it is necessary for the economy, yet it has been proven true that the nation is spending millions more to mop up after the ruin and wreckage of booze than she is gaining by it in revenue!â€
(Hugh Pyle, The Bible and the Bottle)

â€œAnother curse of liquor is a curse of sex desire. It is many times mentioned in the Bible. Let me read it again here in Habakkuk 2:15,16:

Habbakuk 2:15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! 16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.

Evidently it was known in Bible times that drunkenness made people take off their clothes and be immoral.â€
(John R. Rice, The Double Curse Of Booze)

"Too long gospel Christianity has been on the defensive. Someone says, â€˜If you donâ€™t drink, and if you donâ€™t smoke, what do you do for amusement?â€™ We answer that our sense of joy is not so narrow that we can see only these puny things. We donâ€™t have to be pumped up artificially and continually with some stimulant or narcotic to get our â€˜kicksâ€™...â€

In this interview, Joel Osteen finally makes it clear that he believes FROM THE BIBLE that homosexuality is a sin. After being pressed continually, he affirmed that he can only stick with what the Bible says, even though he doesnâ€™t understand it.  This is a great improvement for Mr. Osteen. However, he as still greatly missed the mark in his attempt to be such a positive preacher.
First, the idea that sin is simply â€œmissing the markâ€ implies that it is something that we are not responsible for. Who would whip a child for shooting an arrow and missing his target? Sin is something that God hates. It angers God. It moves God to judge and destroy.
Secondly, Osteen walks the same path as Billy Graham, who when pressed in interviews to say whether something was a sin that is culturally accepted, would respond or imply that all sins are the same! According to God, there are distinctions in sins. Some sins are worthy of death. Jesus speaks of greater sins (John 19:11). Sodomy is always listed as one of the worst sins unto death. It is the bottom of the barrel in Romans 1, etc. Even the smallest sin, without Jesus, will cause us to go to the Lake of Fire, if it was not for the Saviour, Jesus Christ and His Blood. But there are different degrees of punishments in time, depending upon the degree of sin.
Thirdly, the interviewer scolded Mr. Osteen by citing the popular view that homosexuality is not a choice. Mr. Osteen was weak when he stated that he simply didnâ€™t understand it all; and he even implied that the statement was true â€“ thus, implying that God is unjust for saying it is a sin.
Mr. Osteen, Jesus says to beware when all men speak well of you, for the same thing was true of the false prophets in the OT who cried peace, peace, and healed the hurt of the people, only slightly. The world crucified Jesus, because He reproved the world of sin, and testified that its works were evil (John 7:7). Will we seek to appease this world today, in this late, dark hour? They will mock you, Mr. Osteen, for affirming the slightest bit of truth. Therefore, why not just tell them the whole truth? How many homosexuals are now resting more secure in their sin, now that you have stated that their sin in no worse than any sin that any Christian has? And then you dared to agree or imply that it is not a choice.
Whatever  perverted urges or bents a person may have, they are responsible when they act upon them and refuse to resist them. Speak the truth, or else you will soon stand before the God of judgment. And you will see what happens to preachers, who profess His name, who will not properly warn the wicked. The blood of the wicked is upon the head of the preacher who will not warn (Ezekiel 3:18).

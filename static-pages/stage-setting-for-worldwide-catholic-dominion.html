        <h1>STAGE-SETTING FOR WORLDWIDE CATHOLIC DOMINION - KAU#106</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Revelation 17:1...I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
2 With whom the KINGS OF THE EARTH have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

"To princes and other rulers of the State...we have offered the protection of religion. Our present object is to make rulers understand that this protection, which is stronger than any, is again offered to them..." (Pope Leo XIII)

Multitudes of early, premillennial commentaries predicted that there would soon come a day when "Protestants" would merge back to the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) to fulfill Rev.17. Many also predicted that the Democratic and Islamic kingdoms would somehow come under the strange power of the RCC. At the time, this all sounded as preposterous as Israel being restored again as a nation. But time has again and again testified to the fact that literal interpretation (where it is not absurd) is the key to understanding the Scriptures. Before documenting the "merger back to Rome" with recent headlines, I will provide some brief quotations (though not exhaustive) showing how the revival of the RCC has been foreseen by many. The current situation is only a preparation for the fulfillment of Tribulation prophecy in regard to Revelation 17:

"According to Revelation 17 and 18 the Roman Catholic Church will experience tremendous growth in the future, far exceeding that of the past. Her influence will be enormous...God has never recognized the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and Christ...In order to please the kings of the earth, the Roman Church was willing to baptize them as long as they wished to be baptized...So has been the Church of Rome and so shall she be revived in the future." (Watchman Nee, "Come Lord Jesus")

"...the Papal Church is not a dying 'System.'...she is to be revived and become a 'Universal Church,' and in so doing is to commit fornication with the kings of the earth, and that she shall again be 'drunk with the blood' of the martyrs...." (Clarence Larkin, "The Book of Revelation," 1919)

"We hear a great deal about the desirability of church-federation at the present time...We are told that it would be a most excellent thing if the different denominations of Protestants could be united in one great body, and then join hands with the three so-called Catholic churches - Anglican, Greek and Roman. It is pointed out that such a vast union could dominate the world...But we need to remember that such a union as this would not be the body of Christ at all...Rome alone answers to the description given...It is a lamentable fact that Babylon's principles and practices are rapidly but surely pervading the churches that escaped from Rome at the time of the Reformation." (Ironside, "Lectures on the Book of Revelation," 1930)

"Kings can understand a state-religion, with its pomp and forms; and can patronize Rome as the centre of Christianity...The 'church' is regarded as coextensive with the 'nation'...The much admired 'Union of Church and State,' is therefore described here. The union of Church and State is the union of the 'church' and the 'world'....This feature of Rome's history is not yet fulfilled...it predicts a period of noisy, tumultuous, universal enthusiasm throughout the nations of Europe, on behalf of the doctrines of Rome. They will drink copiously of her cup of falsehood, and shout her praises...The nations nominally Christian will turn away their ears from the truth...The drunken man is slow to reason, and the history of the past will not unseal men's eyes to the true principles of Rome, and their dismal effects...millions believe themselves to be Christ's because they were sprinkled in infancy...She is not only a harlot herself, she is 'the mother of the harlots...'...She has set the example of uniting the church and the world: and the other national establishments have followed in her train...Rome calls herself in the Creed of Pope Pius, 'the mother and mistress of all churches.' She is indeed mother of many assemblies calling themselves churches, but they are not owned of Christ as chaste virgins. They are 'of the earth,' and are 'harlots.'..EVERY CHURCH THAT ACKNOWLEDGES ROME FOR HER MOTHER IS A HARLOT..." (Robert Govett, "Govett on Revelation," 1861)

"Now, will a democratic-infidel empire ever suffer itself to be thus overridden by the Papal Church, and promote its exaltation and support?...Popery can unite itself with Democracy as easily as it can with Monarchism or Despotism...Its rapid strides in the American Republic is an illustration of this...Democracy and Infidelity may think it to be for the furtherance of their objects to offer the right hand of fellowship to the Papacy...the ultimate result may be the suppression of Evangelical truth...the scarlet-coloured wildbeast symbolizes the European kingdoms which once supported the Romish Church, when they were Monarchies, now at last supporting it for a season when they shall become Democracies..." (Alfred Jenour, "Rationale Apocalypticum," 1854)

"The Papacy, as directed by the....future Infidel Antichrist, will in the last days fill up the measure of its apostasy, and gather to itself those partial features...now to be seen in Mohommedanism...
...Heathenism, Popery, and Mahommedanism will contribute to supply the features of this system of iniquity...Previous to this time the Jewish restoration to Palestine will have commenced; and their Temple will have been built in Jerusalem..." (T.R. Birks, "The Later Visions of Daniel," 1847)

Indeed, Rome (the RCC) will rise again to persecute God's children. Woe to all Christians that are presently helping Rome come to power! What will those ministers experience at the Judgment Seat of Christ for:

1. Perverting the Gospel of Grace into works, thereby blurring the lines between true Christianity and Catholicism

2. Helping to promote men, ministries and organizations that refuse to take an open stand against Catholicism, but in fact promote ecumenism

2 Corinthians 5:10 For WE must ALL appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that EVERY ONE may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
11 Knowing therefore the TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men...

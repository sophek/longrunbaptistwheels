            "When Connie Neal first read the Harry Potter books a couple of years ago, she was looking for examples of how the best-selling series ran counter to her family's Christian values. To her surprise, Neal discovered that the books by J.K. Rowling actually could be used to illuminate traditional biblical precepts in a culturally relevant way. Instead of explaining to her three children why they couldn't read the Potter series, Neal, a Christian author and activist, created Bible study lessons for them from the books. Each week, her family would gather with friends and neighbors to read the 'Potter' books and discuss how the actions of various characters highlighted the Bible's teachings on right and wrong. Now Neal has collected these discussions in a thoughtful new book, 'What's a Christian to Do With Harry Potter?' (WaterBrook Press, $12.95). Laced with references to the Bible, it celebrates 'the tremendous opportunities afforded Christians by the Harry Potter books and the worldwide interest they have generated. 'I propose that the Harry Potter books are deeply moral and can be highly instructive as 'training in righteousness' if one rightly aligns these stories to Scripture,' Neal writes....Neal believes the lightning scar on Harry's forehead, a result of Voldemort's attempt to kill him, 'can symbolize that God cast Satan down like lightning,' Neal states. 'Satan's power is not equal to God's...'Occult themes have become prevalent, even acceptable, in our culture, so exploring these issues with our children doesn't pose any new or added spiritual threat,' Neal argues...." 

Comments: WHERE IS THE MAN OF THAT HOUSE? For the children's sake, get some backbone and rule your house in godliness. Your wife and children are carried away with every wind of doctrine! This kind of stuff is the reason Laodicea makes Christ vomit (Rev.3:16).

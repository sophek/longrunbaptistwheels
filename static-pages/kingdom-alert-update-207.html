THE FENCES OF FUNDAMENTALISM

Proverbs 22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have
set.

"Mark it well; a man is no better than the newspaper he habitually reads."
(T.D. Talmage, 1872)

In over twelve years as a preacher, I have continually observed something
which fills me with fear and wonder. There are always some new, confident
faces that confuse me for a time. How do they get away with flirting with
sin and still have children who love the Lord, as well as a happy
marriage? They might be flippant with God, and at times irreverently
casual; but most of all, they are smug concerning the "fences" of
fundamentalism. I mean the Biblical "landmarks" which have been recognized
by faithful Christians throughout the ages that are meant to mark our
lawful boundaries. I mean the well-established principles which these
presumptuous ones, seeking a wider range of wandering, rashly mock as
legalistic, silly, or beneath them. The preachers that uphold the
landmarks of separation are viewed by these "liberated ones" (2 Peter
2:19) as radical, extreme, fanatical, Amish, legalistic, out of touch,
etc. However, in the end (and I have never seen it proved wrong once,
given a little time), those who come close to the fire always end up
burned; those who walk close to the edge, soon fall overboard.

What shall we then say to these things? Surely, that those who arrogantly
mock God's warnings against flirting with sin, actually mock God Himself.
And God is not mocked in the end. What a man sows, that shall he certainly
reap (Galatians 6:7). And this is where the momentary confusion lies. Many
are "sowing" presumption, and flippancy toward worldliness. But where are
the tares of destruction which should follow?

They are under the soil. And the destruction will almost never fail to
manifest itself in the end. A man may say: "My living room is bathed with
the bluish glow of worldly programming every evening, and I am still fine.
My family is not hurt. We all love Jesus! My wife works outside the home.
Public school has not harmed our children. They are thriving and blessed.
We enjoy great joy and fellowship with Jesus. We drink moderately and
enjoy the best of worldly Christian music, and we are regulars at the
Blockbuster video store. We are not sinners, but we do want our children
to 'experience' life. Just look at how blessed we are as a family. There
is no disrespect in my children. You don't find that guilty, withdrawn,
apathetic look on the faces of MY family. No sir! Smile children, and show
them how much you love Jesus, and how happy we are!"

Is this all true, as this man imagines it? Usually he is deceived about
the real state of things. But often, there IS an apparent prosperity. How
can this be? Their strength is firm. Their eyes stand out with fatness.
For what reason then, have so many other holy families washed their hearts
and hands of the vile, Hollywood filth? Has it all been in vain? Are the
steps they have taken to home-school, and bring mother home in vain?

No. Surely, they who remove the "old fashioned" landmarks, and mock God's
warnings (saved or unsaved) will be brought to desolation in a moment. The
wisdom of Proverbs, often despised and ridiculed as being merely "Old
Testament," and "for children" will always have the last laugh:

Proverbs 1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out
my hand, and no man regarded;
25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I WILL MOCK when your fear cometh;

Yes, whatever has been sown in the realm of presumptuous "flirtation,"
will one day arise above the soil in full manifestation! He who flirts
with sin and pretends that he doesn't need to follow God's warnings, will
soon have his confidence shattered, and his wickedness SHOWN before the
whole congregation:

Proverbs 26:26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
SHEWED BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION.
27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it
will return upon him.

There are many "stoned" Christians, listening to the "Rolling Stones,"
priding themselves in their "maturity" and "liberty." But something worse
than a MILLSTONE of destruction awaits their necks, both here and at the
Judgment Seat (Luke 17:2). By mocking God's warnings, we teach younger
Christians that they can look, flirt, come nigh to sin, and walk on coals
and not be burned. What a lie!

Young Christians, beware! There are may be even some "old prophets" of
fundamentalism who will tell you that you can saturate your living room
with filth every night AND NOT STINK! But they will get you killed in the
end (1 Kings 13:11, 24). You may get out of Sodom with some scars, but
what about your wife and children?

There are those who will tell you that you can take the "one-eyed devil"
and kiss up to him every night as long as you are "discerning." But
usually you have to view the slime before you know not to watch it. And
then it is too late. And just as Lot "pitched his tent toward Sodom" and
soon ended up dwelling within it (losing his family!), those who try to
pitch close to Sodom by viewing the so-called "decent," WORLDLY movies and
television programs, soon end up TOLERATING the precious name of the Lord
Jesus used as an exclamation (blasphemy!), sexual innuendos, gory
violence, partial nudity, etc. Inevitably, these believers who bring Sodom
inside their homes will put up a protest. They think it is all a joke.
They will wink. "All is well." THEY are not being changed. But what saith
the Scriptures?:

1 Corinthians 10:9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also
tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not DECEIVED: evil communications corrupt good
manners.

Is it not "evil" to identify with people in scripts who solve problems
without prayer and obedience to Jesus? Is not this practical atheism? Are
not the actors and actresses portrayed in sensual situations with
close-ups? Is not sin glorified? Will this bring your family to sincerely
bow the knee in repentance at the altar call on the Lord's Day (Sunday)?
Or will it cause the preaching of the Word to be despised? Will these
movie and music personalities cause young men to be more dependable, to
respect mother and father, and the elderly, to have a good work ethic, and
to flee youthful lusts and rebellion? Will it help young ladies to desire
domestic duties? Or will it rather teach them that tons of make-up, an
impudent face (Proverbs 7:13), a proud look, a stretched out neck,
flamboyant sensuality, and a flaunting, mincing walk (Isaiah 3:16), in
clothing that is about to split apart, are the keys to happiness and
power?

The answer is obvious. To dull your senses to the things of God, simply
love the world by sitting before that wicked "covetous" box or screen:

1 John 2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
world.

When Moses came down from the mount, after fellowshipping with God, his
face shone (Exodus 34:29). When Peter stood outside the palace, those who
heard him said, "Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
bewrayeth thee." (Matthew 26:73, Acts 4:13). Therefore, the truth I am
contending for is established! It works both ways. Your thoughts, your
speech, your look, your ATTITUDE, will all be greatly affected by WHO you
"commune" or fellowship with daily:

Proverbs 13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a
companion of fools shall be destroyed.

Those whom the world calls its "stars" are fools in the eyes of God. And
destruction awaits those who commune daily with them! It may not come in
the morning, but it will surely come. And there should be no surprise when
it arrives. Was there not a CAUSE?:

Proverbs 26:2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
curse causeless shall not come.

The bird comes by "wandering." Likewise, many a curse comes to Christian
homes by those who presumptuously disregard the ANCIENT LANDMARKS and
WANDER (like their favorite "stars") outside of their lawful boundaries:

Proverbs 21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

Jude 1:13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; WANDERING
STARS...
17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the LAST TIME, who
should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

Christians often flirt with sin by taking pleasure in watching others sin
more blatantly (Romans 1:32, Psalms 50:18, Proverbs 28:4). The Bible
forbids these types of evil communications, and warns against them in
numerous places. The wisdom of God teaches us that we are DECEIVED if we
think these communications will not pervert us by further deadening our
moral senses (Hebrews 5:14):

Psalms 101:3 I will set NO wicked thing before mine EYES: I hate the work
of them that turn aside; it shall not CLEAVE to me.
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.

Proverbs 23:31 LOOK NOT thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth
his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter
perverse things.

Proverbs 5:8 Remove thy way FAR from her, and COME NOT NIGH THE DOOR of
her house:
9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:

Proverbs 9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
understanding.

Proverbs 6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
burned?

Romans 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and MAKE NOT PROVISION
for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

Let us be wise and OBEY the wisdom of these Scriptures. If you have a
television, and you think you are strong enough to use it for godly
purposes (e.g. holy preaching videos, home videos, etc.), then disconnect
the cable or the satellite dish. Break off the antenna. Don't make any
provision for moral pollution to infiltrate your home. The Old Serpent is
subtil! He turns the temperature up slowly, as with the proverbial frog,
until he has you boiling. And the second you find yourself at the local
video store, go home instantly and take a sledgehammer to the idiot box.
To even walk in that place is to come out stinking. The second you view
perversion on the Internet, destroy your computer.

Does this all sound extreme? Fanatical? Uneducated? Amish? Legalistic? I
am not mad, dear reader, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
You will see. I am sure that time will vindicate my words, both in this
life, and at the future Judgment Seat of Christ:

Ecclesiastes 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to
do evil.
12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged,
yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which
fear before him:
13 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his
days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
 
I will close this exhortation with an excerpt from Tertullian. Paul, Jude
and Peter all warn that in the last days a mammoth falling-away from God's
moral law will occur. We are living in the midst of this rebellion.
Notice, that when Tertullian wrote, he could not accuse the Gnostic
heretics of actually visiting the theaters and circus, but of only having
no logical reason, based on their doctrine, to abstain from them. Even the
false teachers had yet not grown as depraved as we are today! How sad it
is to read the following words, and see that many modern fundamentalists
are not as "morally separated" today, as even the heretics were in
Tertullian's day:

Tertullian (160-220): "A better god has been discovered, who never takes
offence, is never angry, never inflicts punishment, who has prepared no
fire in hell, no gnashing of teeth in the outer darkness! He is purely and
simply good....And so satisfied are the Marcionites with such pretences,
that they have no fear of their god at all....Come, then, if you do not
fear God as being good, why do you not boil over into every kind of
lust....Why do you not frequent the customary pleasures of the MADDENING
CIRCUS, the BLOODTHIRSTY ARENA, and the lascivious THEATRE?..."
(Tertullian, Book III; and Book I, Chapter VIII, "Absurdity of Marcion's
Docetic Opinions; Reality of Christ's Incarnation,")

LUCIFER WORSHIPPERS NOW THRIVE IN LAND OF BABYLON

"A tribe whose members worship peacocks, believe that lettuces are evil
and are considered to be heretics and Devil-worshippers by their Muslim
neighbours yesterday thanked America and Britain for rescuing them from
Saddam Hussein and laid out their plans for being part of the new
government of Iraq. The Yazidis, who practise one of the more bizarre,
secretive and persecuted cults and claim to number 700,000 in Iraq, have
been reclaiming land and villages taken by the former dictator and are
resuming pilgrimages to their most holy shrine, the Lilash temple in the
mountains of northern Iraq. They claim that they are descended from Adam
while everyone else is descended from Eve. They have already won a seat on
the governing council of the northern city of Mosul and are planning to
restart Yazidi lessons in schools....They believe that Satan was redeemed
and became a peacock, not a Devil. They deny that they are
Devil-worshippers. The Yazidis pray twice a day and their day of rest is
Wednesday. They can drink alcohol and eat pork but not lettuce, which is
seen as a source of evil..." (Dailytimes.com)

POPE AGAIN CALLS FOR NEW WORLD ORDER

"....Your presence here today is a testimony to our common desire to work
together to build a world of peace and security, not only in Israel and
the Middle East, but in every part of the globe, for all peoples
everywhere. This is a task which we undertake not alone but with the whole
international community: indeed, perhaps unlike any time in the past, the
entire human family today feels the urgent need to overcome violence and
terror, to expunge intolerance and fanaticism, to usher in an era of
justice, reconciliation and harmony among individuals, groups and
nations....Three years ago, during my Jubilee Year pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, I remarked that 'real peace in the Middle East will come only as a
result of mutual understanding and respect between all the peoples of the
region: Jews, Christians and Muslims. In this perspective, my pilgrimage
is a pilgrimage of hope: the hope that the 21st century will lead to a new
solidarity among the peoples of the world, in the conviction that
development, justice and peace will not be attained unless they are
attained by all' (Visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman, 23 March 2000).
It is precisely this hope and this concept of solidarity that must ever
inspire all men and women - in the Holy Land and elsewhere - in working
for A NEW WORLD ORDER based on harmonious relations and effective
cooperation between peoples. This is mankind's task for the new
millennium, this is the only way to ensure a future of promise and light
for all...." (Zenit.org, John Paul II's Address to New Israeli Ambassador
to the Vatican, June 2, 2003)

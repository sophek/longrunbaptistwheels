Find out what the saints in the Bible, and historic Christian writers, REALLY believed about the fear of God, warnings to believers, and the Judgment Seat of Christ. These crucial truths have not just been ignored - there has been a "cover -up" in this apostate generation! The FEAR OF THE LORD is the beginning of wisdom. If we go wrong here, or have a watered-down understanding of this fear, we will be robbed of an important, necessary motivation for holy living. Critics will do their best (like all good propagandists) to scare you away from reading this book. You can no more understand this book by reading what its critics say, than you can understand alternative medicine by reading Quackwatch.com! The truth is, there has not been one, single, formal debate about the subject matter of this book in the 5 years since it was published. Yet, most of conservative Christianity continues on, shocked at the carnality and worldliness, doing their best to understand what went wrong - but they will not consider the truth of this book! They will not consider that the very foundation of wisdom (the fear of God) has been absent for a whole generation! Why? For some, it may be pride. They will not consider something that has not been hammered on their own anvils. God teaches us that proud people will not hear His warnings (2 Chron. 34:27). Or, it may be the fear of man, or the fear of losing popularity or money. God teaches us that we will not understand the fear of the Lord if we value money over His wisdom (Prov.2:2-5).

The truth is, Fundamental Christianity has departed from some of its crucial foundations!

The doctrines of Arminianism, Hyper-Dispensationalism, Antinomianism and Hyper-Calvinism are all spiritual cancers, eating away at the truth. Get informed before it is too late!:

Luke 12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes...

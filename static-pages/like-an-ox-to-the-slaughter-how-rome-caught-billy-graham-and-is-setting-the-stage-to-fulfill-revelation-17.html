        <h1>LIKE AN OX TO THE SLAUGHTER: HOW ROME CAUGHT BILLY GRAHAM AND IS SETTING THE STAGE TO FULFILL REVELATION 17</h1>
        <div id="content">
            [Note: The following article is not written to deny any good that Billy Graham has wrought as an evangelist. It is not written out of envy. It is not written to give anyone any morbid pleasure in hearing of another Christian's failings. This article is written to show how easy we can let our convictions slip when we become popular. Let all beware!]

"Nashville, Tenn.: - After preaching to more than 210 million people in nearly 200 countries over the past 50 years, Billy Graham is nearing the end of his crusades...'I'll be preaching to crowds as long as I can,' he said..." (AP, May 26)

This article should fill every discerning Christian with great sorrow. Instead of displaying the flippant self-confidence that Peter displayed before he temporarily fell, this article should also cause every Christian to carefully watch in prayer and fear, lest we also be led astray into compromise. And finally, as we behold signs of this sad "falling away" from the truth, this article should cause us all to rejoice as we discern that the rapture, the coming of Christ, and the Kingdom of God are at hand!

Recently, I provided a lengthy list of great Christians throughout history who, on the basis of the Scriptures, predicted the restoration of the nation of Israel. The 1948 restoration of Israel gives added proof that the premillennial view of these watching saints was (and still is) on the right track. It should also be remembered that these same Christians, on the basis of the Scriptures, predicted that Roman Catholicism would one day rise again, to dominate both the state and Protestantism! At the time, this seemed as far-fetched as the future restoration of Israel seemed before 1948. How would fundamental Christians ever allow such a thing? Yet, these early premillenialists knew better than to lean to their own understanding. Leaning to one's own understanding is for liberals, modernists and infidels. They knew that Revelation 17:14 describes the second coming of Christ, and that therefore, regardless of any secondary, "bouncing" fulfillments throughout history, it anchored the real fulfillment of the chapter in the coming, future Tribulation period.

Now that we are in the year 2000, the Biblical predictions of these earlier premillennialists have been long forgotten by the majority of Christians. This is very unfortunate, for just as soon as Israel was restored, "Protestants" and scores of Baptist, "Bible believers" quit protesting, just as predicted! Hundreds of evangelicals decided that fundamentalism was too mean and narrow. But, even if it could have been proven that a few fundamentalists were sometimes less than courteous, would that justify direct disobedience to the Biblical doctrine of separation? Obviously not!

A vast multitude of premillennial fundamentalists had already lost the fear of God years before this fatal compromise with Rome and modernism occurred. In fact, the compromises were simply the rotten fruit of casting doubt on the preservation of the Bible, as well as losing the fear of God (i.e. the same two devices the Devil had already used on Eve in the beginning.) They lost the real teaching concerning the Judgment Seat of Christ (2 Cor.5:9-11) and began to pamper the saints with soft, flowery images of only "mild rebukes," regardless of how believers had lived out their whole Christian lives. To cover up this obvious antinomianism, they began to pervert the actual Gospel itself! They front-loaded it, back-loaded it (and whatever else they could do to it) to make themselves feel like they were still "manly fundamentalists." It appears they had guilty consciences for sugar-coating the Judgment Seat of Christ into some kind of ice-cream party!

This brought forth two dreadful results. First, without a Biblical Judgment Seat (long taught by great, premillennial fundamentalists such as R. Govett, G.H. Pember, I.M. Haldeman, W.F. Roadhouse, R.E. Neighbour, D.M. Panton, and scores of other Christian leaders) many of their fellow fundamentalists figured that they had nothing to lose for converting to New Evangelicalism. And why separate from denominations taken over by modernists? In fact, why separate from modernists, period? What is there to fear? What is there to lose? Secondly, with their own back-loaded, front-loaded "gospel," they began to have trouble stating what exactly their main disagreement with Rome was all about! Many began to wonder if perhaps the whole historical debate wasn't just a matter of semantics.

So, for the past 50 years we have seen the fear of God practically disappear from modern Christianity; this has led to compromises in every area of Theology. After WWII, Rome (who was looking even more tainted for supporting Hitler), decided she needed a new image. Evangelical Christianity was ripe for seduction. She painted her face and found that there were scores of fundamentalists wandering away from their own houses in the night (Prov.7:8-10). She caught them and kissed them (Prov.7:13), and before they knew what had happened to them, they were already under her spell! With no godly fear, they could not resist her (Heb.11:7). Therefore, the 20th century has not only witnessed the miraculous revival of the state of Israel, it has witnessed the revival of Rome as a seducing whore, set to fulfill Rev.17 in the Tribulation period!

It is important to understand that Rome has no intention of wandering too far from the comfort of her own house (Prov.7:8). Conservative Christians must compromise THEIR beliefs if they want to flirt with her. She has made it abundantly clear that unity will not be possible unless all churches submit to:

"...the authority Christ entrusted to St. Peter and his successors. Unity in Christ is based on following His will. This unity will not be fully manifested until all Christians accept Christ's will for the Church and acknowledge the apostolic authority of the bishops, in communion with the successor of Peter...The Church's structure of authority and service, based on Christ's mandate to Peter and the other Apostles, is an essential part of fidelity to Christ's will."
(Pope John Paul II, "Catholic Moment," Sept. 10, 1995)

Today, finding conservative Christians who have wandered over to Rome's adulterous house is much easier than finding those who haven't wandered (Rev.2:22). Yet, to document this great "falling away" (2Thess.2:3), we will simply focus on the "darling of subtle compromise" himself, Billy Graham. He, like no other, has led multitudes of other oxen (Prov.7:22, 1Cor.9:9) right up to the very door of that "strange woman" with the "attire of an harlot" (Prov.7:5,10, Rev.17:4-6).

Billy Graham, born in 1918, has been listed by the Gallup organization as one of the "Ten Most Admired Men in the World" an incredible 37 times! Graham has been on the covers of Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report. He was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in May of 1996. But Jesus Christ plainly warned His disciples about such things:

Luke 6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

As pleasant as Graham's polished, Carolina accent is to listen to, it is certainly not enough to justify the great exposure he has received. Obviously, Graham has greatly compromised! These compromises are not hard to discover. Ashbrook writes:

"Dr. Harold John Ocknega...first President of Fuller Theological Seminary, is the father of New Evangelicalism...It was Dr. Ocknega, referring to his New Evangelicalism who said: 'There is the appearance of an evangelist, Billy Graham, who on the mass level is the spokesman of the convictions and ideals of the New Evangelicalism.'"
("Evangelicalism: The New Neutralism")

Jack Chick writes:

"After World War II, the Vatican had to pick and back an American champion who would be a friend, a man they would help put on a pedestal, who would be loved by everybody...He could be used as the pied piper who would pull all the evangelicals into the arms of the pope. They wanted a man who would be a good speaker, a man with charisma who could pack stadiums...one who would NEVER attack the Vatican. And so when they found him, William Randolph Hearst, a good Roman Catholic publisher, used his newspaper chain to push Billy Graham to fame."
("Smokescreens," p.53)

Billy Graham did appear to have a relatively "fundamentalist" start (though it was still void of any solid teaching on the Judgment Seat to anchor him). He stated in his earlier days:

"We do not condone nor have fellowship with any form of modernism." ("Pilot Magazine," April, 1951)

"The modernists do not support us anywhere."
(June 3, 1952; Ashbrook)

From here, he of course, went downhill with the majority of the crew. It was right around the time of the founding of the restored nation of Israel that mass compromise entered the fundamentalist camp.

Just a few years later, Graham would state:

"I don't call myself a fundamentalist."
("Christian Life," March 1956)

Graham certainly could no longer call himself a fundamentalist! He was now in bed with Rome. On Sept. 21, 1957, Graham stated in an interview with the San Francisco News:

"Anyone who makes a decision at our meetings is seen later and referred to a local clergyman, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish."

Catholic? Jewish? Why not? Billy Graham believes the "Catholic gospel" saves! On the occasion of his acceptance of an honorary degree from Belmont Abbey, North Carolina, a Roman Catholic Institution, Billy Graham stated:

"'...the way of salvation has not changed. I know how the ending of the book will be. The Gospel that built this school and the Gospel that brings me here tonight is still the way to salvation.'..."
("Belmont Abbey Confers Honorary Degree," Paul Smith, Gazette staff reporter, The Gastonia Gazette, Gastonia, North Carolina, Nov. 22, 1967; D. Cloud).

Starr writes:

"...at an Ohio pastor's convention in Jan.1963 Billy Graham spoke of 'our great religious faith Catholicism, Protestantism and Judaism' adding 'that God blesses the churches that are working together.'"
("The New Evangelicalism," p.8)

Along with Catholicism, Graham's new love for modernism could be seen in his incredible praise for Norman Vincent Peale (of all people). Graham stated in 1966:

"Ladies and Gentlemen, when I was invited to speak here I wasn't sure whether the program committee had gotten the right Graham or not...I am sure that I owe, at least in part, this occasion to my life long friend and person whom I admire so much, Mrs. Peale. I don't know anyone who has done more for the Kingdom of God than Norman and Ruth Peale..." (National Council of Churches Convention)

Graham did not stop at simply flirting with modernists and Catholics. He soon began to flirt with Communists! The AP reported:

"Now that he no longer speaks out against Communism, Evangelist Billy Graham gets more network TV invitations...Although once known as a foe of Communism, Graham told a German news magazine, Der Spiegel...'For years I have not spoken about that (Communism)...I cannot go round the world and say who is right and who is not right.'"

Graham stated in 1973:

"I think Communism's appeal to youth is its structure and promise of a future utopia. 'Mao Tse-tung's eight precepts are basically the same as the Ten Commandments. In fact, if we can't have the Ten Commandments read in our schools, I'll settle for Mao's precepts."
(Mainichi Daily News, Tokyo)

The late M.H. Reynolds, Jr. writes:

"Early in his ministry, Dr. Graham said, 'Today, Communism is the medium through which he [Satan] operates to dupe, deceive and delude that large segment of society which has chosen to believe a lie...Today, millions are embracing the false religion of Communism.' Graham called the Communists, 'The disciples of Lucifer, that in 30 years have slaughtered millions of innocent persons.' At that time, Graham had his facts about Communism straight. But in 1977, following a five day visit to Communist Hungary, Dr. Graham said he 'regretted his former tendency to equate Christianity with the American Way of Life and Communism with the work of the Devil.'"

Sadly, the years that followed would bring no repentance in Billy Graham. His compromises would be so great that even a conservative editor such as Joseph Farah would grow disgusted at Graham's weakness at not reproving sin in the nation's leaders:

"It's symptomatic of the state of moral confusion we live in today that even Billy Graham has been caught up in the religion of pop psychology rather than the faith of the one true living God." (WorldNetDaily)

Graham's love for Catholicism would only grow more ardent. In 1979, Graham stated:

"I think the American people are looking for a leader, a moral and spiritual leader that believes something. And he... [Pope John Paul II] does....Thank God I've got somebody to quote now with some real authority."
(The Phil Donahue Show)

"The Star", June 26, 1979, reported:

"In this exclusive interview, evangelist Billy Graham hails Pope John Paul II's pilgrimage as a triumph for Christianity. Dr. Graham and other religious leaders also heap praise on the pontiff for helping to push forward the religious revival worldwide."

M.H. Reynolds, Jr. documented Graham's apostasy:

"In 1972, Dr. Graham received the Catholic International Franciscan Award for 'his contribution to true ecumenism' and his 'sincere and authentic evangelism.'...By 1983, Billy Graham was not merely referring crusade decision cards to Roman Catholic churches but in the Orlando, Florida Crusade, 150 Catholic lay people from that area were trained to assist in the follow-up of Catholics who made 'decisions.'...Billy Graham, who has often been called the world's greatest evangelist, must now also be recognized as one of the world's greatest compromisers."

The Religious New Service, Jan. 13, 1981, reported:

"Pope John Paul II was closeted for almost two hours with the Rev. Billy Graham, the world's best known Protestant evangelist."

We can be sure that the pope was teaching Billy Graham; it certainly was not the other way around. Just a few years ago, Billy Graham appeared on Larry King Live (January 22, 1997). Notice this sad, almost unbelievable conversation with Larry King:

Larry King: "What do you think of like Mormonism, Catholicism, other faiths within the Christian concept?"

Billy Graham: "Well I think I am in wonder fellowship with all of them."

Larry King: "You're comfortable with Salt Lake City. Youâ€™re comfortable with the Vatican?"

Billy Graham: "Oh, I'm very comfortable with the Vatican... I've been to see the Pope several times....I was his guest..."

Larry King: "You're kidding?"

Billy Graham: "He and I have had a lot of wonderful correspondence.... I have been to see him... He was over here....He invited me on the platform to speak WITH HIM!...."

Larry King: "You were preaching in his church the day he was made pope?!"

Billy Graham: "That is correct...."

Larry King: "Wow!"

[Boastful smiles and prideful giggles from Graham]

Larry King: "You like this pope?"

Billy Graham: "I like him very much."

Larry King: "What about [his] socialism? Liberally, socially?..wealthy nations...'share the wealth'...?"

Billy Graham: "That's right! He and I agree on almost everything."

Larry King: "You like the Clintons?"

Billy Graham: "I like the Clintons very much."

Larry King: "You are a Democrat..."

Billy Graham: "Yes..."

Billy Graham even embraced Robert Schuller. They got together on Schuller's show, obviously to make themselves feel better about their terrible compromises. Graham stated to Schuller:

"...the Roman Catholic Church has changed. They open their arms to welcome us and we have the support of the Catholic Church almost everywhere we go. And I think that we must come to the place where we keep our eyes on Jesus Christ, not on what denomination or what church or what group we belong to."
(Saturday, May 31, 1997)

Just last year, the Evangelical Press News Service (December 24, 1999) reported:

"Graham said one of the most significant changes of the 20th century has been the growing unity of the Christian church, including changing Catholic attitudes toward Protestants. Graham also said that if he were asked to select a man of the century, it might be Pope John Paul II. 'I admire his courage, determination, intellectual abilities and his understanding of Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox differences, and the attempt at some form of reconciliation,' Graham said."

Once again the premillennialists had 20/20 vision by simply taking God's Word literally and believing it. Israel became a nation again and multitudes of conservative Christians followed Billy Graham all the way to Rome. Graham's ministry is now winding to a close. The awful deed has been done:

"As Graham looks to the future, he hopes for many more years of active ministry. 'I do not intend to retire until God retires me,' he said." (1999, Evangelical Press News Service)

But, sadly, I can assure brother Graham, that unless he repents soon, he is at least "in danger" of experiencing a temporary "retirement" he has not counted on. It will be during the glorious, Millennial Reign of Christ:

2 Timothy 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:

Galatians 5:20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, HERESIES,
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

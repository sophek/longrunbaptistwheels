THE COMING OF THE BABYLONIAN LION AND THE PERSIAN BEAR (DANIEL 7)

"Saddam Hussein not only has weapons of mass destruction in development, he probably has some crude chemical, biological and nuclear bombs already in his arsenal. The threat this maniac poses is only going to get worse in the next 12 months as his mad scientists work overtime on plans to kill Americans, Jews, Europeans and Israelis....we must clean Iraq's clock now or the situation will get even worse in the next 12 to 24 months as Hussein develops deadlier weapons and the ability to deliver them more effectively and accurately." (WND, Commentary, "We are Going To War," 9-4-02)

"Israel and Iran: Covert friends? 2 nations possibly cooperating in opposition to Iraq - Recent allegations that an Israeli company was caught shipping military parts to Iran have raised several questions about shadowy ties between the two countries, which share a common enemy in Iraq, reports Stratfor, the global intelligence company. On Aug. 28, German officials seized a ship carrying rubber parts which, interestingly, are used primarily to make tracks for the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, an older, U.S.-made vehicle that many countries use. What made it even more interesting was that the parts were being shipped by an Israeli company called PAD. And what made it absolutely fascinating was that the final destination for the parts was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which, like Israel, uses the M113....Israel and Iran engaged in intense intelligence and military cooperation during the shah's rule. The fall of the shah and the rise of an Islamic regime shattered any formal ties between the two countries, but it did not obliterate their shared geopolitical interests....ideology aside, geopolitical interest kept the channels between Israel and Iran open. That channel has never completely closed, although the level of activity has varied. Israel and Iran remain enemies of Iraq...."(WND, 9-4-02)

Comments: For the past few years, the Kingdom Alert has maintained that all four kingdoms in Daniel 2, 7, and 8 will be revived (Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome), and that the idea that ONLY the Roman kingdom will be resurrected is without support. Let me review this evidence:

1. Daniel 2:44 says that "in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed..." "Kings" is plural. The next part of the same verse reads, "but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms..." It appears that we are dealing with double application prophecy. The historic fulfillment of the four kingdoms was much like John the Baptist fulfilling Malachi 4:5. John did not exhaust this prophecy. Jesus predicted the coming again of the future, literal Elijah, AFTER John was already beheaded (Matthew 17:11). Therefore, in the same manner, we look for all four kingdoms to be resurrected to fulfill the prophecies of Daniel completely.

2. Daniel 7:17 says that these four kings (Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome), are four kings "which SHALL arise out of the earth." The historic rise of Babylon (7:1), obviously did not completely fulfill the prophecy of the first king. The angel did not say that THREE kings shall arise, but that FOUR shall arise.

3. Daniel 7:12 refers to the kings of Babylon, Persia and Greece, and says, "As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time." This appears to state that they are in existence in the tribulation period, before the Second Coming of Christ.

4. Daniel 8 absolutely teaches that Persia and Greece (2nd and 3rd) are kingdoms in the final days, in the LAST end of the tribulation period (before Rome comes to power). It reads:

Daniel 8:17...Understand, O son of man: for at THE TIME OF THE END shall be the vision.
19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the LAST END of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of MEDIA AND PERSIA.
21 And the rough goat is the king of GRECIA: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.

This prophecy does not just teach that these kingdoms will be PRESENT in the tribulation period. It teaches that they will reign in dominance, consecutively.

5. Scriptures such as Isaiah 13, when read plainly and literally, teach a future revival of the Babylonian kingdom in the midst of the tribulation age.

These are the main reasons why I look for Iraq (the modern Babylonian kingdom) to arise and go forth to conquer at the start of the tribulation. This kingdom will greatly persecute the Jews. Following the historical pattern, Iran (modern Persia) must afterwards arise and defeat Iraq (Isaiah 13:17, etc.) and allow the Jews a period of restoration, when they will restore their temple. This will be followed by a Grecian persecution, which will in turn be followed by the rise of Rome, which will bring the final Antichrist and the worst persecution and bloodshed in all of history.

Is it not amazing that, at the same time that we see so many other stage-setting signs coming into focus, we also see the rise of Iraq? Isn't it also amazing that Iran is a foe of this kingdom? And isn't it amazing that there is even speculation that Iran (Persia) and Israel could be working together in some capacity?

I do not know what will occur concerning Iraq. I have maintained in the Kingdom Alert that there are at least four possible scenarios:

1. The rapture occurs very soon and Iraq attacks Israel and gains temporary power in the midst of world chaos and confusion in the west.

2. The U.S. is unable to gain enough support for a war, and Iraq is allowed to continue to grow in power, until the rapture.

3. The U.S. is judged for falling headlong into the sins of Sodom and Nineveh, even when it had so much more light. Its leaders do not repent of such national sins as praying to Allah, allowing the killing of babies, and endorsing sexual perversion (which destroys the family and society as a whole). Therefore, God does not give the nation the ability to break Iraq's rise to power.

4. The world community decides to endorse the removal of Saddam. But the removal only allows the Babylonian kingdom to prosper and become the world center which Bible prophecy foretells.

The Lord, in His longsuffering and mercy, can hold back the forces of evil and His own earthly judgments. But we must not presume that He will do so. We must watch and pray and, if need be, repent.

HOLINESS: A MAIN PURPOSE FOR PROPHECY

There are a growing number of Christians who despise the study of Bible prophecy. Some of these maintain that the pursuit of holiness is the most important thing, and that it is somehow "carnal" to be concerned with lions and bears, beasts and dragons. But why then is so much of the Bible concerned with prophecy? Such Christians who reason this way, may have the right goal at heart, but they do not understand God's means.

Noah was forewarned about the flood. Did he ignore this prophecy? No! Notice what the Scripture tells us:

Hebrews 11:7 By faith Noah, BEING WARNED OF GOD of things not seen as yet, MOVED WITH FEAR, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

Noah believed God about the future, and this caused him to MOVE with fear in the present. But what about the rest of mankind in his day?:

Matthew 24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
39 And KNEW NOT until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

They lived their lives in total ignorance of God's prophecies. They were busy. But they were not obedient.

There are some people who raise up an objection by pointing to supposed times in history when zealous prophecy advocates dressed in white and sat their lives away on a mountain looking for Jesus. Perhaps these saints were right about the watching, but wrong about the MOVING which is to be the result of the watching (as we see in Noah). Noah would not have been obedient if he would have dug a hole and stuck his head in it to keep it dry from the coming rain. But it is also true that his work might have been greatly hindered if he would have reasoned in the following manner:

"I do not need to believe God about the future. Enoch also prophesied, but he was speaking about the coming of the Lord thousands of years from now. God's judgment may be centuries away. Or, perhaps God is speaking figuratively. A 'flood of waters' may refer to some future wars or something of that nature. This is all very cryptic. Who can understand these things? We do not want to be guilty of newspaper exegesis. We must keep up our appearance of 'intelligence' before this grand community we live in. And we must remember that mankind has been given dominion. I have so much to do for society. I cannot let myself get too distracted with apocalyptic theories of impending doom."

Therefore, we are called to use prophecy to excite ourselves to MOVE. The watching and believing is for the purpose of moving in obedience and holiness. The Bible teaches that Christians must constantly be reminded and animated. We naturally tend toward slothful sedimentation. The Holy Spirit uses His prophetic Word (which includes promises and warnings) to excite us and stir us to move for Him.

As we discuss one of the main purposes of prophecy, notice the purpose of the Scriptures in general:

2 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
17 THAT THE MAN OF GOD MAY BE perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

This is not surprising since the Lord also states that HOLINESS is one of the main purposes of our salvation:

Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
10 For we are his workmanship, CREATED in Christ Jesus UNTO GOOD WORKS, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

Titus 2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
12 TEACHING US that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
14 Who gave himself for us, THAT he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of GOOD WORKS.

These Scriptures are clear! We are too look for the coming of Christ, and we are to understand that Jesus gave Himself for us to make us HOLY! To teach that God is only interested in holiness in the next life, at the resurrection, is to border on blasphemy!

Now notice how this present life of holiness is in many ways connected to and ignited by the study of prophecy:

2 Peter 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
11 SEEING THEN that all these things shall be dissolved, WHAT MANNER OF PERSONS ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
12 LOOKING FOR and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
14 Wherefore, beloved, SEEING that ye look for such things, BE DILIGENT that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
17 Ye therefore, beloved, SEEING ye know these things before, BEWARE lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

Prophecy is connected with MOVING in the above Scripture. This is true to such an extent that Jesus taught that any teaching that tempts disciples to believe that His coming may be postponed for a long time has the potential to WORK SIN in them:

Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord DELAYETH HIS COMING;
49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he LOOKETH NOT FOR HIM, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

The Bible teaches that many Christians will not be walking in holiness in the last days (2 Timothy 4). I believe there are there reasons why this will occur:

1. Prophecy will be taught WITHOUT its accompanying conditional promises and warnings (see my article on "Emasculated Watching").

2. Prophecy will be taught as entertainment and ear scratching WITHOUT using it to make a final appeal to obey God's commandments (see much of the "sound doctrine" Christians will not "endure" in the last days explained in Titus 2).

3. There is, and will continue to be, a great movement away from the study of Bible prophecy, especially in a literal, premillennial fashion. The result will be apathy. Dead, compromised "machinery" will replace Spirit-filled, sin-hating, purifying, zealous work for God.

I believe we must get back to preaching and teaching God's commandments. We must use prophecy (with its warnings and promises) to stir up the minds of saints to action. This is not "legalism." It is the PURPOSE for which God has created us in Christ, the purpose for which He has given His Scriptures to His people, and the purpose for which He foretells us the future. Let us be mindful of these things and the days grow darker.

MORE AGAINST ADHD

"ADD 'not a real condition' - The legitimacy of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder as a medical condition is questioned in a new report. The report, commissioned by the Youth Affairs Network of Queensland, has called for a moratorium on and inquiry into the use of the amphetamine-based drugs Ritalin and Dexamphetamine to treat ADHD - diagnosed in thousands of Australian children....The report author, psychologist Dr Bob Jacobs, said non-medical treatment of children with behavioural problems and learning difficulties, such as improved parenting and teaching techniques, was being ignored in favour of a 'quick-fix pill.' Dexamphetamine sulphate and Ritalin, or methylphenidate, are in the same family as the illicit methamphetamine, and have been used since the 1930s....'Professionals in many parts of the world have begun to question whether the 'disorder' really exists, or if it is just a label we give to children who are misbehaving.'
Commissioner for Children and Young People Robin Sullivan, a former deputy director-general of Education Queensland, supported the call for further research..." (The Courier-Mail)

"(AgapePress) - A Christian educator says the National Education Association has teamed up the psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies to promote the sale of 25 different psychotropic drugs to children. Twenty percent of America's 50 million public school students have been declared mentally ill and are on prescription drugs like Ritalin, Adderrall, and Prozac. Dr. Richard Simonds is president of the National Association of Christian Educators....He says children are being placed on addicting and life-threatening drugs equal to cocaine, opium, or LSD because they have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - or ADHD. According to Simonds, ADHD was concocted by the American Psychiatric Association in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies in order to sell drugs....Simonds points out that 25 Schedule II drugs are being provided to children diagnosed with ADHD. A Schedule II drug is defined as a substance that has a high potential for abuse with severe liability to cause psychic or physical dependence. 'It's a very serious thing not only because it's harming children and frying their brains permanently, but making them permanently addicted and allowing them to feel better in class,' he says. 'If a kid is too hyper, naturally when they give him a drug he's going to calm down.' In fact, Simonds says, the child is drugged - 'and they call that a cure,' he says. Simonds notes that schools receive a minimum of $1,300 a year for each student who is designated with ADHD."

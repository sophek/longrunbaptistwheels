            THE PRESENT INCREASE IN NATURAL DISASTERS: WARNING CONTRACTIONS BEFORE THE
ACTUAL BIRTH PANGS BEGIN

Jeremiah 22:17 But thine EYES and thine heart are not but for thy
covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for
violence, to do it.
21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear.
This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
22 The WIND shall eat up all thy PASTORS, and thy lovers shall go into
captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy
wickedness.
23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
gracious shalt thou be when PANGS come upon thee, the PAIN AS OF A WOMAN
IN TRAVAIL!
29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

This whole age (since John the Baptist began his preaching) is called the
"last days" (Hebrews 1:2), or "the ends of the world" (1 Corinthians
10:11). However, the Bible teaches that there will also be "last days" of
this last period:

2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS perilous times SHALL
COME.
13 But evil men and seducers shall wax WORSE AND WORSE, deceiving, and
being deceived.

After the Luke 21:36 "escape" of watchful believers (which is still
future), the remaining period of time (Revelation chapters 6-19) is
likened unto a pregnant mother in labor:

1 Thessalonians 5:3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as TRAVAIL UPON A WOMAN WITH CHILD; and they
shall not escape.

This actual "labor period" also has stages; it will culminate in the
Second Coming of Christ in Revelation 19.

But if we are not yet "prophetically" in the final age of God's
indignation, how do we explain the obvious increase in "tribulation signs"
in the last few decades (especially in the past few years)? The analogy of
the woman in labor actually serves to explain what we are observing in
this present time. Directly before a woman goes into labor, there is often
a "false" labor that will occur. It fools many women, and trained midwives
(awakened in the middle of the night) quickly learn to discern the
difference between the "stage-setting" contractions (i.e. Braxton-Hicks)
and true labor. This "false" labor gets the body ready, and serves as a
final warning that the true "travail" is near. Notice these words from a
standard, pregnancy web site:

"Here are some WARNING SIGNS labor will begin within days....You
experience an INTENSIFICATION of Braxton-Hicks contractions, those spasms
you may have been feeling in your lower abdomen." (Yourbabytoday.com)

We are seeing this "intensification" today! In recent years, we have seen
global temperature records repeatedly broken around the world. Among other
"contractions," we now have tornados breaking everything in sight,
including all previous TORNADO RECORDS! Notice some recent headlines:

"298 Tornados In A Week!" (Drudge Report)

"Twister Caps Nation's Worst Tornado Week" (Yahoo News!, May 10, 2003)

In the Tribulation Age, weather disasters will abound:

Jeremiah 25:32 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth
from nation to nation, and a GREAT WHIRLWIND shall be raised up from the
coasts of the earth.

Luke 21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the WAVES ROARING;
26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after THOSE THINGS
which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

These will be the final contractions. However, the present tornados in the
United States are simply "warning contractions." But how many will hear
the warning?:

Jeremiah 22:21 I spake unto thee in thy PROSPERITY; but thou saidst, I
will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou
obeyedst not my voice.

There is a grave danger of despising (ignoring) the chastisements of the
Lord. What does the Lord desire from us? He certainly desires from us, in
this age, what He will soon desire from the whole world in the actual days
of "travail." He desires a sincere repentance:

Revelations 9:20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these
plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not
worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and
of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of
their fornication, nor of their thefts.

Many true Christians today, in various ways, are also guilty of idolatry,
murder, sorcery, fornication, and theft. This is especially the case when
we realize that it is a SIN to have pleasure (i.e. entertainment) in those
who do these things:

Romans 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but HAVE PLEASURE IN
THEM that do them.

Shall we as Christians view these present "contractions" with SCOFFING?
Shall we pretend that there is no real increase in these disasters? Shall
we bury our heads in the sand and pretend that we are only "imagining" an
increase in these disasters, and that they only "appear" to be increasing
due to better monitoring equipment? Jesus commands us to use tragedies as
an opportunity and warning to repent, REGARDLESS of the reason they are
present:

Luke 13:4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew
them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in
Jerusalem?
5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

Yet, how often do we hear prophecy teachers issuing an urgent, sober call
for repentance in the face of global disasters? Too often, the zeitgeist
of the age is for such men to spend half an hour trying to convince
everyone that "all is swell." This is what sells: "All is well, there is
no Hell." But it is NOT the Holy Bible! Jesus taught that too much
prosperity can dull the mind to reality:

Luke 21:34 And TAKE HEED to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and
so that day come upon you unawares.

There is a holy detachment that is free from irresponsibility or laziness.
Every Christian should seek to mature in this holy detachment and
separation:

2 Timothy 2:4 No man that warreth ENTANGLETH himself with the affairs of
this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

Philippians 4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at
hand.

We are not in the Tribulation Period. The Lord is longsuffering. Why don't
we do things His way and quit making excuses for ourselves?:

Psalms 34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
trusteth in him.
9 O FEAR the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear
him.

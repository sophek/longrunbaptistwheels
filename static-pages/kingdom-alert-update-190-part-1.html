A RESPONSE TO ROBERT L. SUMNER'S EXTENDED REVIEW OF "THE ROD: WILL GOD SPARE IT?" IN THE NOVEMBER-DECEMBER, 2002 ISSUE OF "THE BIBLICAL EVANGELIST" (Conclusion)Â 
SUMNER: "Faust attempts to answer Samuel L. Hoyt's articles in Bibliotheca Sacra about the Bema Seat, but he is not very successful. He quotes him about 'receiving back' for bad works: 'The answer lies in the fact that unworthy, sinful deeds merit no reward....Reward will be granted only for righteous deeds.' Faust answers, 'Reward can either be positive or NEGATIVE' (his emphasis) and to prove it he offers Romans 11:22 (the goodness and severity of God...'...Alas, again he has taken a text out of context. Paul was talking about the favor of God in this passage, cutting off Israel and grafting in the church....Was he talking about both 'goodness' and 'severity' for the children of God? Of course, not! The severity was for, as the passage plainly notes, 'unbelievers.'..."Â 
By choosing this verse to comment upon, brother Sumner implies that Romans 11 is my primary proof that rewards are both positive and negative. While I certainly believe my application of that Scripture is warranted, I actually have two whole chapters on the subject in my book (i.e. "Negative Rewards in This Life" and "Negative Rewards at the Judgment Seat"). Here are some excerpts from the section in my book that Sumner is commenting upon above:Â 
"Proverbs 26:10 The great God that formed all things both REWARDETH the fool, and REWARDETH transgressors.Â 
'This Bema (translated 'judgment seat') is to dispense not only happy rewardings but also the opposite.'Â 
-W.F. Roadhouse (1875-1951)....Â 

<span style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: x-small;">Â </span>
2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we MAY be ACCEPTED of him.
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may RECEIVE the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or BAD.
11 Knowing therefore the TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men;Â 
If Bible words mean anything, then there was some sense in which Paul labored to be accepted. Notice the phrase "the terror of the Lord." Paul knew it. Yet, it appears that modern Christendom's view of God is severely deficient. The Bible's numerous warnings to the saints are therefore denied at all costs.Â 
On this passage in 2 Corinthians 5, Samuel L. Hoyt writes:Â 
'The question this verse raises is how one 'receives back' what Paul calls 'bad.' The things a believer receives back for his good works are obviously rewards, but how can one receive back for sinful works without some sort of punishment involved? The answer rests in the fact that unworthy, sinful deeds merit no rewardâ€¦Reward will be granted only for righteous deeds.'Â 
Hoyt has failed to realize that the Bible teaches that 'rewards' are often given in the form of punishments! Reward can be either positive or NEGATIVE:Â 
Romans 11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, IF THOU continue in his goodness: otherwise THOU also shalt be cut off.Â 
Hebrews 10:30 For WE know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will RECOMPENSE, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge HIS PEOPLE.Â 
Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus unto HIS DISCIPLES, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall REWARD every man according to his WORKS.Â 
When defining the word 'reward,' Noah Webster comments on Matthew 16:27:Â 
Â 
'In the latter passage, reward signifies to render both good and evil.'.." [end of excerpt]Â 
My arguments above reveal that Hoyt (and Sumner, who is attempting to defend him) is wrong in his interpretation of 2 Corinthians 5:9-11. Is it not obvious that the heart of man will do almost anything in interpretation to escape accountability? Does not the Bible itself predict that such will be the state of much of Christendom in the last days?Â 
Hoyt takes Paul's clear warning about RECEIVING back for good AND BAD (followed by a reference to "terror"), and tells us that the "receiving" is actually "NOT receiving"! To defend such a twisting of the text, Hoyt teaches that it is possible since REWARDS are ONLY positive in nature. Therefore, to be rewarded for bad would actually mean to receive NOTHING. Hoyt and Sumner both embrace this idea even though the English dictionary and the Bible itself define the word "reward" as having to do with the rendering of blessings and/or PUNISHMENTS. Notice the following Scripture:Â 
Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the REWARD of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
25 But he that doeth wrong shall RECEIVE for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.Â 
This word "receive" in verse 25 is the word used in 2 Corinthians 5:9-11. Colossians 3 is a warning to Christians (as is 2 Corinthians 5:9-11). Does the person in Colossians 3:25 "receive for the wrong" by receiving NOTHING? He will certainly miss the reward of verse 24. But that will not be the end of it. He will obviously also RECEIVE something.Â 
And if we are to believe that "receive" and "reward" are only positive in nature, what are we to do with the following Scripture?:Â 
2 Peter 2:13 And shall RECEIVE THE REWARD OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;Â 
Perhaps Sumner would tell us: "Since these spots will not receive a reward, what they will really receive is nothing, since to not earn a reward is to not get one." This is absurd. What about this Scripture:Â 
Luke 23:41 And we indeed justly; for we RECEIVE THE DUE REWARD of OUR DEEDS: but this man hath done nothing amiss.Â 
Can you imagine a person telling these men on their crosses that their crucifixions were simply illusions, since the "receiving" of "due reward" simply means they do not get a prize? Sumner at times stresses the "Bema seat," as if such a Judgment Seat (KJV) cannot administer PUNISHMENTS. Yet, both of these thieves (as well as our Lord Himself) once stood before Pilate's BEMA SEAT (John 19:13)! They were not awarded with prizes. They were not told that they will receive "nothing." They were crucified. Therefore, a "Bema Seat" is a Judgment Seat. It can administer positive or negative "rewards."Â 
In regard to the word "reward" (although proof has already been provided), notice one last Scripture:Â 
Revelation 18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.Â 
Does this mean that Babylon will simply end up missing a prize? Will there be no actual negative judgment administered?Â 
SUMNER: "It is interesting what Faust didn't quote in the Hoyt item above (the ellipsis). Here is missing a section, which offers solid explanation: 'An unfaithful Christian receives the appropriate recompense for that which is worthless, namely no recompense at all. For example, a student who turns in a worthless assignment receives a failing grade. He receives what he deserves....Likewise the unfaithful Christian will receive the commensurate recompense for his worthless works. He will receive no reward at all for those particular deeds.' Amen!"Â 
Can it really be said in the English language that a student who turns in a worthless assignment and receives a failing grade receives "no recompense" at all? By what dictionary is "recompense" said to be only positive? The Bible certainly does not use the word in this manner:Â 
Hebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will RECOMPENSE, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.Â 
Hebrews 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every TRANSGRESSION and disobedience received a just RECOMPENCE OF REWARD;Â 
Failing grades, if continued, may result in flunking school (or at least this used to be the case). The exact nature and degree of the consequences for laziness or rebellion depend upon the situation. A man on parole who fails to report, or who leaves a designated area, may end up back in prison. The consequences for lying in Acts 5 was death. The consequences for not discerning the Lord's body in 1 Corinthians 11 were sickness and death. This is in the day of God's longsuffering. What shall be the recompense for those who refuse to heed God's earthly warnings?Â 
If to "receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad," ONLY means to fail to receive the prize (which it doesn't), what would it prove? The positive reward for obedience and faithfulness is entrance and reign in the Millennial Kingdom (2 Timothy 2:12, Matthew 18:3, Acts 14:22, Hebrews 4:1,11, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, etc.). The man who does not receive this prize in Matthew 25:30, goes into outer darkness.Â 
SUMNER: "There is nothing here to indicate Christians will be cast into outer darkness for over 1,000 years to be punished for their failures."Â 
I glean from 2 Corinthians 5:9-11 what it teaches. It teaches that some true believers will nevertheless receive for bad deeds, and it will be TERRIBLE! The details of this punishment are not given since they are supplied by other Scriptures. Sumner throughout his entire review scarcely offers an explanation of the Lord's warning parables to His disciples. Yet, these are the words that teach the details concerning where the unfaithful believer spends the duration of the Kingdom. These are also the very words that Paul told us some men would try to ignore (1 Timothy 6:3-5). We might remind Sumner that there is also nothing in 2 Corinthians 5:9-11 that states, "This warning is not as bad as it sounds. In Greek, the word for 'terror' here only means 'fear.' The 'receiving' for bad deeds really only means not receiving for the good deeds." When Sumner finds this exact wording for his view anywhere in the Bible, we will also show him the exact wording he is looking for! Let me make it easier for him. Where does the Bible state (in exact words): "No Christian will be punished at the Judgment Seat of Christ." Sumner's objection is like the J. W.'s asking us where the word "Trinity" is found in the Bible. I tell them the exact word is found in the same place the exact phrases "Jehovah's Witness," "Kingdom Hall," and "ransom sacrifice" are found! Sumner knows that I can show numerous places where believers are warned of stripes, outer darkness, fire, hell, and exclusion. I assume Sumner interprets these as applying only to "pretend" Christians. Yet, he thereby logically destroys the Biblical doctrine of assurance for believers. And he cannot find the words, "false Christian," "fake Christian," "false professor," "professor," "pretend Christian," anywhere in his Bible, no matter how hard he tries. There are certainly a multitude of people (mainly in cults and liberal churches) who claim to be Christians but are not born again. However, it is irresponsible to apply warnings directed to true Christians to "false Christians."Â 
Sumner: "Doesn't Faust know that 'bad deeds/works' are SINS and for him to say believers will be 'punished' for them (instead of 'suffering loss' by losing rewards) is an insult to the finished work of Christ?"Â 
No, what is an insult to the "finished work of Christ" is for these brethren to pervert the Gospel of salvation in ETERNITY in a mad attempt to escape TEMPORARY punishment. Does a "professor" have to wait until after death to have ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE (as Rome and the Evangelicals who signed E.C.T. teach)? Any man who teaches that a person's absolute assurance of eternal salvation is based on fruit-bearing (and not Christ's Blood shed on the Cross) is Popish! But this is exactly the conclusion that Sumner must embrace if he will tell us that the warnings addressed to believers throughout Scripture (concerning CONDUCT) are to "false professors." This means he must wait till after death to ask God whether or not he measured up. How many sins make one a false professor? How long must one persist in these sins to prove he is not a real Christian? It is amazing that after embracing this Gospel-compromising, Rome appeasing system of interpretation, these men will dare accuse me of denying the finished work of Christ on the Cross for teaching that a believer may receive at the Judgment Seat what many ALREADY receive in this life, in the age of God's patience! Surely Sumner knows that I wrote a whole book on this subject. Why doesn't he deal with the answer I give? I even catalogued the objections in a chapter all to itself so it will be easy to find. Here is the objection answered on page 284 of my book:Â 
"Did Not Jesus Pay for Our Sins at Calvary? - Jesus paid for all our sins, past, present and future, as far as eternal salvation is concerned. No sin can ever rob a believer of eternal life on the Last Day (after the millennium). Yet, there are sins that Christians commit as children of God. And Godâ€™s children are held accountable for their faults (if they do not confess their transgressions and seek mercy in fear). If Jesus is not free to judge unfaithfulness at the judgment seat, He is not free to judge it in this present life. Yet, almost all commentators admit that the Lord judges His saints in this life (1 Corinthians 11, Hebrews 12). The distinction in Scripture is therefore, between temporary and eternal judgment. Christians can never be judged eternally for their sins since Jesus has paid the full price for them on the Cross. Yet, the sins of believers can bring temporal judgments, and the millennium is temporal. The forgiveness of sins in regard to believers is not automatic, and it must be maintained (Matthew 6:15, 18:35, 1 John 1:9)."Â 
Sumner never tells us why sinful believers do not simply "suffer loss by losing rewards" in this life. The Judgment Seat of which Scripture continually warns has not yet arrived. Yet, God does more to erring Christians (for whom Christ died) IN THIS LIFE, than Sumner believes He will do at the actual Judgment Seat! God at times makes them sick, and at other times He slays them (1 Corinthians 11:30). The Bible calls this "scourging" (Hebrews 12:6), which is a harsher word than punishment itself! Sumner never tells us by what logic we are to conclude that sickness, afflictions, and death as chastisements for sin in this life do not take away from Christ's work on the Cross, but TEMPORARY, literal chastisements on the day of JUDGMENT does take away from the Cross. This strange disfigurement is perhaps derived from the old Catholic/Protestant amillennialism and postmillennialism which was not aware of the intervening Millennium between this age and eternity.Â 
Christians can SIN (2 Corinthians 12:21, 1 John 5:16). And sin (unless God exercises mercy beforehand) can be recompensed by God in this life (1 Corinthians 10:10, 11:30-31), and at the Judgment Seat (Hebrews 10:26-27, Colossians 3:25, Luke 12:45-46, etc.). Such temporary chastisement does not in any manner minimize the eternal work of Christ on the Cross. Ironically, it actually guards it. The Christian may now have absolute assurance of ETERNAL life (based fully on Christ's blood), since all unfaithfulness is simply evidence of impending, temporary punishment at the Judgment Seat and during the Millennium - not eternal torment.Â 
Sumner: "The author needs to settle in his mind whether or not 'bad works' are 'sins.' If they are, it is unquestionably a horrible case of double jeopardy..."Â 
This manipulation of sound words is a proof of the lawless nature of this age. My book answers Sumner's question:Â 
"Doesnâ€™t the Bible Teach That Our 'Works' (and Not Our 'Sins') Will Be Judged? - S.S. Craig (1855-1936) answers this objection: 'On this passage [2 Cor. 5:10] Dr. Scofield comments as follows: 'The judgment of the believer's works, not sins, is in question hereâ€¦Matt. 10:12; Rom. 14:10; Gal. 6:7; Eph. 6:8; Col. 3:24, 25â€¦'â€¦Matt. 10:12â€¦has no bearing on the subject whatever. Eph. 6:8 has reference to the Christian's good deeds, but says nothing of the evil; and the other three passages affirm the very opposite of the Doctor's contention. How very emphatic is Col. 3:25: 'But He that doeth wrong (assuming that he has not made it right) shall receive for the wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons.' Surely that is plain enough. Those who hold the theory in question say it is the believer's works and not his person that is to be judged. Is it conceivable that an evil work, apart from the person who does it, can be judged, the sentence executed and justice satisfied thereby? How would the theory work in civil jurisprudence? Suppose society should say, 'We will let the murderer go free, but we will judge and punish the deed.'â€¦Christ bore the believer's sin and sins on the cross judicially. But this will not save the believer from sinning; nor from reaping as he sows.'Â 
The Bible reveals that Christians can be judged for 'sins' (1 John 5:16-17, James 1:15, 2:9, Hebrews 10:26, Romans 6:16, 1 Timothy 5:24). There must be a distinction made between position and practice (i.e. walk). No believer will be punished judicially for sins after salvation in a positional, eternal sense. However, there are temporal judgments (in this life and during the millennium) for sin in believers. The semantic distinction that is often made between bad works and sins is erroneous. Evil works are sins." [end of excerpt]Â 
Sumner: "Faust argues that since chastening and scourging are the lot of Christians in this life it follows the same kind of response will be true after death for those who need it. That reasoning is not necessarily true, but much of what he says pursues that idea. In fact, what is God's purpose in chastening His children in this life?...One purpose is to make us partakers of His holiness. That will have already been accomplished before the Bema Seat..."Â 
I am glad that Sumner finally gets around to meeting this argument. I have maintained that if literal, temporal chastisement in this life does not minimize the Cross, then neither will literal, temporal chastisement on the day of the Judgment Seat minimize it. Sumner argues against this by rephrasing my argument somewhat and then saying that this is not necessarily true. But that is not an argument. But what of Sumner's appeal to God's purposes in chastisement? It is agreed that one purpose of chastisement in this life is to make us holy. But another purpose is to show that God is not MOCKED:Â 
Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; GOD IS NOT MOCKED: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.Â 
Another purpose (stated in Scripture) is to keep us from being judged with the unbelievers at the Lord's coming:Â 
1 Corinthians 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we SHOULD NOT BE condemned WITH the world. (see also 1 Corinthians 5:5)Â 
Often believers react to chastisements by DESPISING them (Proverbs 3:11). If we ignore these warnings to repent, we will indeed be condemned with the world (not eternally, but during the Millennium):Â 
Luke 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion WITH THE UNBELIEVERS.Â 
The unbelievers do not enter the Kingdom; neither do believers who fail to heed and respond to the Lord's earthly chastisements. Sumner has set up a straw man by LIMITING the purposes of God. Making believers holy is only ONE of His purposes in chastisement. If we are tempted to despise these earthly chastenings, we are met with the warning of "so much SORER punishment" at the Judgment Seat. If we fail to hear this warning, God will be just. He is not mocked. He cannot deny Himself. He will do what He has threatened to do.Â 
This idea that all scourging is ONLY to make us holy does not stand up to Scripture. Ananias and Sapphira, and some believers in Corinth were actually slain! God obviously has manifold purposes for chastening His people. And if scourging in this life does not take away from the Cross, then neither does temporary scourging at the Judgment Seat.Â 
Sumner: "Who will have praise of God when Christ comes to judge His own? Paul says 'every man!'"Â 
This is an incredible interpretation of 1 Corinthians 4:5. I have only seen one other man (i.e. Herb Evans) maintain that ALL believers will be praised at the Judgment Seat! This is certainly Laodicean wishful thinking. The passage means that on the day of judgment it will not be MAN who will be doing the judging, it will be GOD. Ironside is correct in regard to this verse when he states: "The context, however, seems to show that it is a question of the source from which the praise comes, rather than an affirmation that all will have praise." The Universalists (who believe every human being will eventually be saved) would agree with Sumner that "every" means "every" in 1 Corinthians 4:5. Therefore, I am sure Sumner would reply that "every" must be taken in a relative sense to mean "every Christian." I likewise reply that "every" must be taken in a relative sense to mean "every faithful Christian"!Â 
Sumner: "the saved will be delivered...even such backsliding creatures as Lot, who certainly deserve the harshest punishment....But to say that the Lots are to be punished with the unjust is certainly going far beyond what is written."Â 
Lot is an example of a believer who barely escapes the judgment of death. He nevertheless suffers great consequences. Although Lot is an example of escaping earthly punishments (though barely), I am sure there will be many Christians at the Judgment Seat of Christ who will only have an hair-breadth escape from Millennial exclusion. They will enter the Millennial Kingdom, but will have a lower position that others (Matthew 5:19). If Lot pictures (among other things) a believer who will barely make it into the Millennial Kingdom, LOT'S WIFE pictures those Christians who will miss the Kingdom! Jesus warns His disciples to REMEMBER Lot's WIFE. There are too many Christian teachers today who only remember LOT!:Â 
Luke 17:22 And he said unto the DISCIPLES, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it...
32 Remember Lot's wife.Â 
Lot's wife was punished WITH the unbelievers (Matthew 24:51). The angels laid hold on Lot's wife and brought her out of Sodom. The Lord is also very merciful to many believers today. He keeps us from many temptations. But when we presume upon His mercies and provisions, we are in grave danger at the Judgment Seat:Â 
Hebrews 3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
14 For we are made partakers of Christ, IF WE hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.Â

1. WASHINGTON, DC -- A bipartisan group of 17 Members of Congress, including US Rep. Ron Paul (R-Surfside, Texas), filed a lawsuit on Friday, April 30, 1999, in federal court against President Bill Clinton for violating both the US Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution with regard to Yugoslavia. Rep. Paul has led Congress in the opposing the unconstitutional military action, introducing the first legislation to stop the measure early in this Congress, and speaking against it last year. â€œThis president has violated the law and he must be taken to task," said Rep. Paul. "It is a shame that Congress has not done more to stop the president from this destructive course. So it is therefore incumbent upon us to resort to the courts to force Mr. Clinton to follow his Oath of Office to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States."..."This president is putting American soldiers, and indeed all Americans, in danger by engaging in this reckless action," said Rep. Paul. "We must not allow this or any president to declare themselves above the law." Congress voted this week 427 to 2 against a declaration of war with Yugoslavia, voted to prohibit funding for ground elements, and finally, denied support for the ongoing air campaign.â€

2. â€œâ€˜You really can't live without Christ. It's like impossible to really have a true life without him.â€™ --17 year-old student, Cassie Bernall, in a home video. She was murdered by one of the two Littleton predators after they asked her if she believed in God andÂ  she responded, â€˜Yes.â€™ The irony: This was a troubled young woman whose parents cared enough to enforce â€˜tough loveâ€™ and bring her to the foot of the cross, but who died at the hands of two young men whose parents didn't care.â€

3. "President Clinton recently signed executive order (E) 13107, Implementation of Human Rights Treaties. The new EO requires federal, state and local governments to comply immediately with all United Nations Treaties, whether or not those treaties have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as required by the Constitution. One of these treaties, the UN Treaty of Genocide, says that persuading someone to change his or her religion is a hate crime punishable by international law. The new EO 13107 is expected to be used strongly by the newly established Office of Religious Persecution Monitoring to arrest and imprison Christian missionaries and witnesses anywhere in the world who preach Jesus only. From now on, this will be considered a hate crime - genocide.â€

4. â€œWhen John Wimber became a Christian, the first service he attended was not what he expected. The story goes that after it ended, Wimber, who later founded the Vineyard Churches, asked, "When do I get to do the stuff?" He wanted to perform miracles, as Jesus Christ did. That sort of thing doesnâ€™t happen anymore, Wimber was told. "Do you mean I gave up drugs for this?" he replied.â€
(Religion Today)Â 

[Comments: Someone should have told Wimber to seek the future Millennial Kingdom of God since the miracles the early disciples did were a â€œfirstfruitâ€ or â€œearnestâ€ of the Holy Ghost power that will be experienced in that blessed age. Their miracles were, as G.H. Peters puts it:Â 

â€œ...a pledge of fulfillment in the future, evidencing what the Holy Ghost will yet perform in the coming age.â€ (â€œThe Theocratic Kingdom,â€ Vol.III. p.66)Â 

Those great signs were spoken of in past-tense by the time Paul wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews. (Heb.2:3,4) God will reward every deed or sacrifice. Wimber therefore started out his Christian walk without faith (which to be true must believe God is a rewarder of all who diligently seek Him). He basically said he will not wait in patience for any â€œfutureâ€ Kingdom when Christ comes to reward His faithful saints. He will instead make this world the â€œKingdom,â€ even if he has to PRETEND! Multitudes of Vineyard charismatics are also walking without faith or patience as they follow Wimberâ€™s presumptuous footsteps into the ditch.]Â 

THE EARTHâ€™S FUTURE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATHÂ 

â€œ...wherever the Bible is read, almost all who read it enough to form any opinion at all, on hearing the millennium mentioned, instinctively connect it with the seventh thousand years of earthâ€™s history.â€
(Rev. David Bosworth, â€œThe Millennium and Related Eventsâ€)Â 

â€œ...God is presently working during a period which will last 6,000 years in order to bring about the restoration of two ruined creations (man, and the material creation), and at the end of this period, God will rest for 1,000 years. This is not only in complete accord with the established pattern set forth at the beginning of Scripture, but this is plainly what the subsequent Scripture reveals is happening and will happen.â€
(Arlen L. Chitwood, â€œThe Heavenly Callingâ€, Spring, 1999)Â 
KIDS ON LEGAL PSYCH-DOPE ONE OF THE MANY PROBLEMSÂ 

We live in a day when many parents will not train their children with proper discipline nor keep them from corrupting influences. Yet, we also live in an age that is filled with pride and envy. (2Tim.3) Could it be possible that many of the more affluent parents would rather place their children on legal â€œcocaineâ€ to improve performance rather than endure the pain to their pride when their children do poorly or cannot exercise self-control without it?Â 

Anyone who has had a sinful past of doing illegal drugs knows that most of those who take speed, crank or cocaine can sit still and â€œtalkâ€ in-depth for hours. (Much like the effect coffee-addicts can experience on multiple cups of coffee). It is obvious that â€œshort termâ€ performance will indeed usually increase. But what will be the LONG TERM result to oneâ€™s mind, body and soul? The pharmaceutical companies are certainly not taking any chances on the answer to the question:Â 

â€œWarning: sufficient data on the safety and efficacy (effectiveness) of long term use of Ritalin in children are not yet available.â€
(CIBA Pharmaceutical Company)Â 

Obviously, it is absurd to be happy that little â€œJohnnyâ€ is able to do all his school work so well on his new psyche-drugs. Feed the kid 15 cups of coffee or a line of â€œcokeâ€ and you will see some results...for AWHILE! Yet, there is a good chance you will also drive the kid completely, literally insane:Â 

â€œMind altering drugs may be the cause of violence among school children, according to some doctors and other experts. Millions of children are legally taking drugs similar toÂ 

cocaine in schools every day. The drugs are Ritalin, Prozac, and others. The claims that behavioral drugs cause violence in children came after news reports that Eric Harris, one of the shooters in the Columbine High School shooting, was reported to have been taking such medication. Harris was also rejected by the Marines for medical reasons. TheÂ 

Marines would only say that anyone who is currently being treated by a doctor would be rejected. Other shootings and violent acts at schools across the nation have been committed by children receiving psychiatric care, counseling, and drugs such as Ritalin, according to several groups. At least two organizations claim that over-use of Ritalin is to blame for the escalating incidents of children committing acts of violence on other children. They claim the problem has reached pandemic proportions and will get worse before it gets better....A report issued in 1995 by the Drug Enforcement Agency warned that Ritalin "shares many of the pharmacological effects of ... cocaine." There are some experts who claim Ritalin can cause psychotic reactions resulting in violent behavior toward others and suicide. Defenders of the drug claim those reactions are symptoms of the condition, not the drug itself. Support for the claim that the use of Ritalin can cause psychotic reactions can be found in medical literature and studies. A simple search on the Internet revealed extensive volumes of medically credible documents listing a vast number of warnings and side effects to the drug, which is classified by the U.S. government in the same category as cocaine and heroin...Among the side effects the doctors warn about are "psychotic thought processes." Clarke also points to the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Revised Edition," published by the American Psychiatric Association, as supporting his claims of the dangers of Ritalin in children. All the critical information about Ritalin has been removed in the more recent edition, which he says supports his claim that the industry is engaged in a cover up. Proponents of the use of the drug claim the change was simply made in error. Clarke claims that children who take Ritalin in elementary school are often switched to Prozac and other drugs as they grow older. The effects of Ritalin can cause problems long after the prescription is stopped, he added. "When they go through puberty, this becomes true speed," explained Clarke. "They get these flashbacks and their thinking goes out of control. They're now looking for downers. They want the anti-depressants. They want the tranquilizer."Â 

Clarke is not alone. Dr. Ann Blake Tracy, director of the International Coalition for Drug Awareness is equally concerned. They are switching lots of these kids from Ritalin to Prozac -- the frying pan into the fire routine," she told WorldNetDaily. "Kip Kinkel in the Oregon shooting last summer was a perfect example of the effects. The chances the boy in Arkansas was on it are great." She also pointed out that adults who use such drugs also commit violent crimes at a higher rate...The high number of incidents involving violent children, as well as an increase in children who commit suicide, can be attributed to an ever-increasing number of children who are being given drugs to control their behavior, according to Clarke...Clarke went beyond his claims of psychotic side effects to the drug. He also claims that pharmaceutical companies go to great lengths and expense to cover up the problems that take place. When an incident of violence occurs, the pharmaceutical "crash teams" go to work to keep things quiet, according to Clarke. Teams of psychiatrists are sent to the places where incidents take place and quickly work to see that medical records are kept sealed, doctors are convinced to remain silent, and victims are given monetary payments to prevent them from ever going to court. "It's all being covered up, and it's deliberate. There are billions and billions of dollars at stake here," explained Clarke...â€
(WorldNetDaily, April 29, 1999)Â 

â€œProduction of Ritalin, the controversial drug used to treat nearly four million supposedly â€˜hyperactiveâ€™ schoolchildren, has jumped 700 percent since 1990. Writing in the April/May issue of â€˜Policy Reviewâ€™, journalist Mary Eberstadt, a former member of the State Departmentâ€™s Policy Planning Staff, provides an in-depth overview of the Ritalin debate in an attempt to answer the question: â€˜How has it come to pass that in...America, where every child from preschool onward can recite the â€˜anti-drugâ€™ catechism by heart, millions of middle and upper-middle class children are being legally drugged with a substance so similar to cocaine that, as one journalist accurately summarized the science, â€˜it takes a chemist to tell the differenceâ€™?Â 

Eberstadtâ€™s documentation includes excerpts from a 19995 Drug Enforcement Administration background paper describing methylphenidate (Ritalin) as a â€˜central nervous system (cns) stimulantâ€™ which â€˜shares many of the pharmacological effects of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine.â€™ Parents considering Ritalin for their children...will want to peruse Mary Eberstadtâ€™s incisive analysis before making up their minds.

THE FUTILITY OF VAGUE SYURPY PREACHINGÂ 

"We are going to have to do some serious thinking in this country about how we can take more control over what our children see and experience. The constant exposure to violence on TV, in the movies, on video games, in music - there's much too much evidence that children get desensitized...There's so much of it. We're awash in it...We can no longer shut our eyes to the impact the media is having on all our children, and the potentially violent impact it is having on some of them....â€
(Mrs. Hillary Clinton)Â 

It almost sounds like a moment of holy sobriety in the First Lady. Unfortunately, it stops short of getting anything done. Do â€œweâ€ really need to do some serious â€œthinkingâ€ about how to â€œtake controlâ€ over what â€œourâ€ children see? Isnâ€™t it all quite simple? Why not SAY it? For crying out loud, why not encourage mothers to ask their husbands if, for the sake of the children, the family TV may be disposed of? Now since she has confessed that the TV is filled with violence and is therefore dangerous to those who watch it, at the very least she should have encouraged mothers to FORBID their children from watching it! I was not able to read this whole statement from Mrs. Clinton. Maybe she did not simply leave everything in such a state of high-sounding nothingness. Yet, sadly, I suspect she did. Telling people to do good things they do not â€œwantâ€ to do makes one unpopular. There are a lot of mothers out there who will not tell their children NO in regard to TV. They are raising spoiled brats and they think this is â€œloveâ€. No, it would be political suicide to go against these mothers by telling them what THEY need to DO about the violence. It is much easier to complain about the â€œviolenceâ€ in general.Â 

Perhaps this is for the better. I am afraid that many in government may think â€œgetting something doneâ€ means limiting the rights of free speech which may in turn be used against Christians.Â 

The First Lady continued, seeming to radically change her point altogether:Â 

â€œ...We need to stand up and say what needs to be said about guns and firearms."Â 

I am afraid that is not going to help anything. The bombs those high school killers had were not â€œlegalâ€ were they? Outlawing guns only insures that the â€œoutlawsâ€ have them. It does nothing to stop people from becoming outlaws.Â 

By changing the subject, the First Lady avoids telling people to DO SOMETHING. I am tired of hearing everyone â€œdance aroundâ€ the issue in regard to TV and Hollywood depravity. We have many now, like Mrs. Clinton, who are â€œmaking mentionâ€ of this one problems:Â 

â€œThe TV media continue to suck every drop of blood out of the Littleton massacre. The great irony, of course, is that the same medium from which so much indoctrinal violence emanates would exploit Littleton for all its â€˜titillation value,â€™ or as Linda Bowles says, â€˜The unctuous over-coverage of the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., demonstrates once again how the television 'news' media often behave like pimps, hustling to deliver sensationalism to a salivating and patently voyeuristic society.â€™"
(The FEDERALIST Digest]Â 

Indeed, all around the country thousands of people are blasting the TV media. Yet, I am afraid that many saved, born-again preachers â€œpreachâ€ like Mrs. Clinton! God forbid that a preacher start shouting and screaming from the pulpit about how corrupt Hollywood or TV is without preaching against the SIN of CHRISTIANS watching the junk and making OPPORTUNITY (Rom.13:14) to watch it: â€œDid you see that last night? Oh heavens, what is the world coming to?â€ No, the real question is, What are YOU doing watching it? Get out the theater! What are you doing with cable? Why do you have that junk hooked up to your house where your precious wife and children are? Have you heard the TRUTH about the Judgment Seat of Christ? (2Cor.5:9-11, Eph.5:5-7) Instead of sitting around crying, â€œOh no...look how bad...what are we to do about it? Canâ€™t somebody do something?â€ My question is what is anyone with common sense doing sitting around WATCHING the junk? Why do YOU have that satellite dish preacher? Many modern Christians love to â€œcomplainâ€, but not many are willing to live without the â€œgod-boxâ€ allowing them to â€œtune inâ€ to this depraved world:Â 

Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.Â 

Now you may not â€œlikeâ€ those words, but you must admit they are CLEAR. You have no doubt about what I am encouraging you to DO about the problem. Many will indeed unsubscribe rather than endure such â€œclarity.â€ That is a price one pays to get something done. If one family is moved to make a real, tangible stand in their household, that is at least one more kid that has a good chance of being protected from the incitement to murder his peers. Yet, if people preach with vague, religious â€œsoundingâ€ verbosity, they will get vague, religious â€œlookingâ€ results! True, not many will be â€œoffendedâ€. Yet, neither will much good be done.Â 

Where are the nation-wide campaigns to treat the TV like a gun? If you can justify having one before God, it needs to be put up, out of the way of children, disconnected from the depraved, degenerated world, and then only used responsibly with adult supervision.Â 

I am tired of syrupy, mystical religion among Christians: â€œOh, but we know it is not the really the TV...â€ Yes, people need to get saved, get born again, get a new heart, etc. More emphasis needs to be put on direct, Biblical evangelism. Yet, I must disagree with the those who would ignore the great degree in which evil acts encourage more evil. Watching depraved sex and violence for entertainment on TV will surely result in greater acts of depravity! The Bible is clear on the matter. (Prov.22:24,25, etc.) Therefore, we must not speak with in a multitude of high sounding, mystical, religious verbiage that does nothing. We must not dance around moral issues. We must get right to the point and begin to clearly define SIN step by step: 1. Throw the TV away. Read a book with your family or go for a walk. You will not? 2. Okay, then put it in the closet. That is too much for you? 3. Okay, then disconnect the antenna. Still too much? (What church do you go to? Do you go to â€œFun &amp; Barbecue Fellowship-Church of Modern-Day Carnal Saintsâ€?) 4. Okay, then vow to watch only holy programs (educational or Christian videos) at a SET TIME with the family in prayer, thereby showing the children that the TV is dangerous.Â 

Mrs. Clinton could have done much good if she would have simply told mothers what to DO (e.g. you know: â€œJust say NO to TV and moviesâ€ etc.). I pray that preachers across the land will not make the same mistake. I hate vague, syrupy preaching. I hope I never preach like that.Â 

CHILD CRIMINALSÂ 

I by no means wish to be understood as teaching that TV, Ritalin, etc. are the whole of the problem with modern youth. In the last KA Update I listed some other factors. I do not hold to the error that sees TV, Ritalin, etc. as only â€œeffectsâ€. They are certainly actual, contributing â€œcausesâ€ as well as effects. Nevertheless, at the near bottom of the bottom I would place the failure of multitudes of Christians to understand and preach the truth about the Judgment Seat of Christ and the reward of Kingdom reign. Along with this, I would place their embracing of the lies of modern textual criticism which teaches there is no written, â€œfinal authorityâ€ (KJV), thus resulting in mysticism. These two sins produce â€œsavorlessâ€ (saltless) Christians with little or no effect at all on the world around them. Thus, churches are quick to â€œwater-downâ€ truth.Â 

Plus, there are more practical sins that are contributing to youthful decadence, such as the failure of millions of families to become involved with a strong church. (If you canâ€™t find one, gather together and begin to plant one!) I found a pamphlet in my library by D.M. Panton from 1924 called â€œThe Cry Of The Children.â€ In light of modern problems, it is most interesting. The following is a portion of it:Â 

â€œDr. Stanley Hall, a specialist on the subject, says: - â€˜There is a marked increase of crime between the ages of twelve and fourteen, and the proportion of juvenile delinquents seems to be everywhere increasing, and crime is more and more precocious.â€™ We find in the Great War an extraordinary revelation. The number of juvenile convicts in Germany increased fifty percent between 1892 and 1895 - that is, among the men who have filled the trenches. The population of Germany is to that of England as 5 to 3: yet the proportion in bigamy is 1 to 2 nearly; in incest, about 13 to 1; in procuring, 264 to 1; in procuring abortions, 29 to 1; in unnatural offences, 7 to 1; in rape and other sexual crimes, about 9 to 1; in murder, manslaughter, and other death-causing crimes, 5 to 1, in arson, about 4 to 1; in divorce, 22 to 1; in illegitimate births, 5 to 1; in suicides, 4 to 1 (Times, April 12, 1916). Now what is the vital secret behind these startlingly disparate figures? It is not education: for university men in Germany are fourteen in every ten thousand; in America ten; in England (apart from Scotland), five. The secret is laid bare when we learn that, though with a population nearly twice the size, Germany has only nine hundred thousand Sunday School scholars against Britainâ€™s over five millions. And alas, this apostasy, percolating from the theological halls of the Higher Criticism into the day school and the nursery, and so blighting a nation at its roots, continues to deepen iniquity in child-life. German child convictions were, in 1914, 585; in 1915, 1, 145; in 1916, 2,895; and in 1917, 4,012. â€˜The increase of criminality among the young,â€™ says the Hessian Minister of Justice, â€˜is terrifyingâ€™ (Times, April 4, 1918)â€ Panton concludes:Â 

â€œAn undermined Bible; a hard, un-Christ-like temper in the home; the fostering of worldly pleasures in the young heart; the promotion of a marriage tie with an unbeliever; the stimulating of ambition for worldly careers: -the wilderness is strewn with the carcasses of such little ones; and by the carcass, too often, stands the prophet that lied.â€Â 

Conclusion: Get in a good church instead of the ball-park or theater, and stand with all your might against liberal, luke-warm, apostate theology! In general. take heed how you raise your children:Â 

Matthew 18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.Â 

Unlike the â€œsons of Godâ€ mentioned in Job, these guardian angels mentioned by Christ have constant access to the Fatherâ€™s Throne. The angel of the Lord was tempted to slay Balaam for smiting a poor, helpless ass.(Num.22:31-33) What kind of wrath then do these angels experience when someone wrongs or misleads the â€œlittle onesâ€ they are appointed to watch over?! These are indeed mysteries, by I would not mess around and offend â€œwatchersâ€ if I were you. (Dan.4:17)Â

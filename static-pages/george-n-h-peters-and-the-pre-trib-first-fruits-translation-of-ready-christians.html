            GEORGE N.H. PETERS AND THE PRE-TRIB, FIRST-FRUITS TRANSLATION OF READY CHRISTIANS
In past issues of the Kingdom Alert Bulletin we have manifested the true beliefs of such wise, godly men as G.H. Pember. Prophecy writers like G.H. Pember and G.N.H. Peters (both taught a pre-trib, selective rapture) are often praised and exalted by modern "scholars" as mighty war-horses of pre-trib, premillennialism. Yet, many of these same scholars when attempting to refute a pre-trib, partial rapture of Christians (in spite of Rev.3:10 and Luke 21:36, etc.) are often found arguing something like: "The partial rapture view is unorthodox and has only been held by a few obscure teachers...". Perhaps such an argument persuades many paperback Christians (who can't wait for another Batman movie) to believe they are in no danger of experiencing the coming Tribulation. (It is still that old "Roman" technique: Give the sweet, nice promises in the N.T. to believers, but give the warnings to the cursed "Jew".... Haven't they noticed that everyone has crowns in Rev. 4 & 5? Where are those that missed out? Rev.3:11. Hint: They are not raptured or resurrected yet! Rev.11:18. They are in the Trib. Rev.2:22) ... Only a few, obscure, feeble-minded souls ever taught a partial rapture? For those who have bothered to read the volumes put out by Pember, Peters and other great "pillars" of premillennial Bible prophecy, such an emotional argument against the first-fruit rapture doctrine appears to be downright dishonest.

Of course, if it were true that hardly anyone of any real weight or skill ever taught the first-fruit rapture doctrine, such would not prove much at all. Hardly anyone was teaching that the Antichrist is to be one literal person in the future, and that Moses and Elijah would come back as the witnesses in Rev.11, before William Burgh came along as the great pioneer of revived "futurism" in the 1820's. Prophetic light ever continues to shine increasingly brighter in these darkened shadows of "perilous times".

In this article, for those readers who may not have had the opportunity to read the large work by George Peters (1825-1909), we will document Peter's belief in a pre-trib, firstfruits rapture. We will then show the great extent the writings of such men of the last century are esteemed, while at the same time it is often implied that the firstfruits rapture is "obscure" and "unorthodox". (The same line was given about Gen.2:17 not long after it's proclamation. See Gen.3:4, Ecc.1:9 )

At this point, we will let Peters take over. It was for our age that he always felt he was really laboring. To Peters, our generation would most need (and some within it, most value) his writings. The following quotes are taken from the Theocratic Kingdom (Kregel Publishing):

"These are 'the firstfruits' of the harvest - specially belonging to the Lord - the harvest itself...follows later in the divine order." (III p.24)

"...it is reasonable to suppose, judging from God's past dealings, that He again will grant special deliverance to those who are devoted to Him. At this time also, the removal being designed not only to save out of tribulation, but to prepare the saints, deemed worthy of it... for joint participation in the administration of judgments upon the nations..." (II p.316)

"That we are to distinguish between 'the firstfruits' and 'the harvest' is self-evident, for they are separated and treated distinctively in Holy Writ, as e.g. Rev.14:1-5.." (II p.319)

"Thus e.g. Luke 21:36 'Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man;' the escaping and being favored with nearness to Christ are united. In Rev.3:10, of a class it is said: 'Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation...which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. '...' (II p.323)

"What causes such a change..?. Nothing less than this astonishing removal of certain chosen ones, accounted worthy, owing to their distinctive faith in God's promises, to escape. Let this event occur just as it is described; let here one and there one of the believing and watching be taken, and surely those who believe in God's Word and are left behind will be most wonderfully affected by the event.... The writer has often, often felt that it is specially for this period that he is laboring, when his work will be appreciated..." (II p.327)

"...such faith and watching is eminently set forth as a characteristic of those translated ones. Because they thus believe, showing due respect unto God's Word, and permit such faith to have its practical effect in heart and life, we are assured that they shall thus be favored... At the same time we deeply feel that without a special preparedness, devoted piety (as exemplified in the translated Enoch...) which evinces itself upon the Church, Millenarianism, however upheld and ably defended, is unable of itself to secure such a distinguishing benefit and honor. A personal, individual acceptation of the truth combined with a happy experience of its sanctifying influence, together with testifying in its behalf before others, is imperatively needed. It is not simply those who 'watch' that shall 'escape,' but those, Luke 21:36, who 'watch and pray always,' avoiding the corrupting influences around them." (II p.332)

"It is reasonable to expect that this doctrine of a translation will be ridiculed both before and after the occurrence of it...Among these results that of the special honoring of some living saints by a translation without seeing death is already made the subject of derision and sport... This naturally is to be expected of the world, but unfortunately some of the scoffers are professed believers in that Word of God, which expressly teaches a still future translation to come suddenly, as a snare, upon the Church and the world...Human nature will be true to itself, and the doctrine will be particularly detestable to it, since it evinces a species of favoritism - a contrast - condemnatory to its own Naturalistic and Humanitarian position." (II p.335)


Great Advocates of the Pre-trib Partial Rapture
The following is a "partial" list of many well known exponents of the firstfruits rapture doctrine. It is by no means complete. This sample list is given simply for those subjective souls who place great weight on "fruit" when judging the truth of a doctrine. It is hoped that all would understand that the Scripture is the final authority when it comes to deciding whether a certain doctrine is right or wrong. Along this line, G.H. Lang, in ably defending the firstfruit, selective rapture doctrine, has wisely stated: "...great names cannot prove any one view to be the true meaning of Scripture." Nevertheless, "fruit" is certainly an encouraging, additional testimony, after one has been convinced of one's view on the sole authority of the Word of God. Such is especially the case when there appears to be an attempt to conceal, ignore or deny the great scholarship, holiness, wisdom, zeal and practical results that have sprouted forth from the ministries of those that fervently embraced the partial rapture doctrine. Rarely, when reading a rebuttal to the partial rapture does one find an honest, "healthy" list of it's great teachers given. And sadly, it is often even implied as the cornerstone of the critique, that such an absence of "orthodox heavyweights" is the prime ground for ignoring it. Therefore, although the pre-trib, partial rapture doctrine has so much plain, clear Scripture as a "main course" of evidence in it's favor: - Lk.21:36, Rev.2:22, 3:10, 22:16-19, 4:10, 5:8-10) we will nevertheless, graciously offer the following witnesses as a "dessert" of ripe fruit in the closing arguments:

Robert Govett, D.M. Panton (editor of The Dawn, with it's many contributors: William Leask, Ira E. David, John Scruby, W.H. Hubbard, Sarah Foulkes Moore, J.Buchler, etc.) G.H. Pember, H.W. Fry, Hudson Taylor (founder of the China Inland Mission) A.B. Simpson (founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance) John Wilkinson (founder of the Mildmay Mission to the Jews) Samuel Wilkinson, Otto Stockmayer, George Peters, Joseph Seiss, G.H. Lang, Watchman Nee, etc.!


Praise from those who Reject the Partial Rapture
It is seen that, not only were the advocates of the partial rapture far from "unorthodox" or "obscure"; many were in fact the prime pillars of premillennialism, prophetic exposition and missionary enterprise. Further testimony to this fact can be gleaned from the abundant accolades and praises heaped upon the ministries and lives of these people by those that even reject the doctrine of the partial rapture. (We must remember that Laodicea sees itself as far too rich and "feminine" to have to go through any old, dirty tribulation period. See Rev.3:17) The praises of such men upon the teachers of a partial rapture do not prove the doctrine is true. (The truth of a "partial" rapture is proved by reading Luke 21:36 and Rev.3:10 in a King James Bible with the television set off!) However, it does prove the point at hand. It proves that when one goes to refute the pre-trib, partial rapture position honestly, one must start the argument with something like the following: "Although this position is held by many of the main warriors of premillenialism, and although it's advocates were mighty saints of God who brought forth so much fruit on the field of battle, and although most of modern scholarship has still not attained to the height of Biblical exposition put forth by such teachers, nevertheless, it is our belief, based upon modern findings in textual criticism dealing with such passages as Lk.21:36 and Rev. 4 & 5, etc. that their particular view of the rapture (even though it did work a great deal of holiness by instilling the 'fear of God' in converts) is at considerable variance with the Scripture. To start with it divides the 'Body of Christ', it tends towards legalism, it fails to keep Israel and the Church distinct, not to mention the fact that 1Cor.15 and 1Thess.4 teach that 'all' go up, being saved from the wrath to come."

Now of course, it would be difficult for anyone to keep up such honesty in the argument. They would have to leave a full "proof" of the arguments they raised, and drift into emotional absurdities like.."But how good does one have to be to go up?"...and "All those partial rapturists think they are going on the first train out..." All such objections (even the silly ones) have been clearly answered over one hundred years ago in a spirit of charity, humility and fairness. (Although I strive to never call one a fool, or judge the heart of another absolutely (Mtt.5-7), I find it rather hard (and perhaps unbiblical! See Titus 1:9-13) to be too sweet to "scholars" that insist upon taking the proper fear of God out of the lives of young Christians, especially when such men as Pember, Panton and Lang have already, repeatedly been so kind and "charitable" when dealing with their unjust objections.)

Let us now note the extent that the following "partial rapturists" are esteemed by many that nevertheless reject the partial rapture doctrine. (Esteem for other great partial rapturists could be shown as well. However, the following quotes provide enough evidence to prove the case at hand: The partial rapture is not some "unorthodox" or "obscure" doctrine taught by some spaced out no-names who spoke in "gibberish" and danced naked.) The following sample of teachers are themselves no friend of the pre-trib, partial rapture:

"The whole battle over the Amillennial-Postmillennial interpretation of prophecy was fought and won by the greatest theologians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One of these was Premillennialist Dr. George N.H. Peters who wrote The Theocratic Kingdom in three volumes (originally published in 1884 by Funk and Wagnalls of New York) Dr. Wilbur Smith who was a scholar and professor at Fuller Theological Seminary and probably read more books than anyone of our times, called Peters' volumes, 'The most important single work on Biblical predictive prophecy to appear in this country at any time during the nineteenth century. The author of these volumes must have read everything of importance in the major areas of history, science, literature and theology..."
Hal Lindsey (The Road to Holocaust, p.105)

"(G.H. Lang)...one of the outstanding scholars of our generation."
Wilbur Smith (A Preliminary Bibliography for the Study of Biblical Prophecy)

"(Robert Govett)... My own opinion is that he brings to his interpretation a more thorough knowledge of the Scriptures in their bearing on the last book of the Bible that any other writer of his generation."
Wilbur Smith (A Preliminary Bibliography)

"Mr. (Robert) Govett wrote 100 years before his time and the day will come when his works will be treasured as sifted gold."
C.H. Spurgeon (Surrey Chapel, Book of Remembrance)

"(Joseph A. Seiss)...The most famous work published in this country on the book of Revelation."
Wilbur Smith (A Preliminary Bibliography)

"(Joseph A. Seiss)... "...probably the most forceful exponent of Biblical prophecy in America in the mid-nineteenth century..."
Wilbur Smith (Theocratic Kingdom, preface, Kregel)

"(Samuel Wilkinson)...Written by the late director of what is probably the most fruitful work among the Jews in England, the son of a distinguished Biblical scholar and author, and himself a profound student of the entire subject of Biblical prophecy as it relates to the future of the Jewish people...An indispensable work."
Wilbur Smith (A Preliminary Bibliography)

"(G.H. Pember)...Certainly one of the greatest books on the general subject of the great prophecies of the Old Testament relating to the Gentiles and the Jewish nation to be published during the last fifty years, by one of the best Bible scholars in Great Britain."
Wilbur Smith (A Preliminary Bibliography)

"(G.N.H. Peters)...a thorough and exhaustive study of the subject, going far beyond 'kingdom-scholars' in either the Fundamentalist or Modernist camp."
Peter S. Ruckman (Matthew)

It would be needless at this point to continue. Pember, Seiss, Lang, Panton, Govett, Peters, etc. and the missions and ministries of the many other great partial rapturists are constantly praised by a large diversity of teachers advocating premillennial theology (and even many that would not). If such "fruit" does not convince one to take another look at the partial rapture doctrine (most have never looked to begin with. They went off to "school" before they had a lick of Biblical sense, and were brainwashed) it would certainly silence the implied argument that the partial rapture is some new, novel, obscure doctrine. The partial rapture teaching did not arise out of a pre-trib total rapture teaching. It can be proven that the reverse was true. (Growing out of the early "futurism" that held believers accountable, though secure). Certainly, one view is as old as the other. If "quality" and "fruit" matter at all, the partial rapture doctrine is surely at the forefront of premillennial theology.


Obscure and Unorthodox?
Notice a small sample of various rebuttals to the partial rapture:

"There has arisen in the last century, however, a small group of pretribulationists who contend that only those who are faithful in the church will be raptured or translated...."
John Walvoord (The Rapture Question)

"The partial-rapture theory is probably the least popular of all the rapture viewpoints."
John Walvoord (The Millennial Kingdom)

"There is a fourth view concerning the Rapture of the Church which has recently been introduced. It is not widely taught, since it is unorthodox and at considerable variance with the Scripture. However, it is a view that could gain some following among those who are weak on knowledge of the Word of God and strong on experience and human viewpoint."
Hal Lindsey (The Rapture)

"Such a view has been adopted by a small minority of the Church..."
Gerald Stanton (Kept From The Hour)

It is not so much what is said in the above statements as much as it is what is concealed from the reader (whether intentional or not, we will leave to the Judgment Seat of Christ, 1Cor.4:1-5). In all fairness, every now and then, one runs across what appears to be an honest rebuttal of the doctrine. (Too bad honesty does not make one right!) One writer started his rebuttal with the following:

"Supporters of the partial rapture theory usually are prolific writers as well as dedicated saints. Such a combination has naturally attracted a following that is numerically out of proportion to their theory's theological worth."
Paul Lee Tan (The Partial Rapture Theory in Light of The Scriptures)

We would have to say that that was quite a manly way to start off compared to most of what has been offered. Of course, in light of the evidence, it nevertheless was timid and pale.

The partial rapture teaching will increase rapidly in the next few months and years. The Lord is "knocking" with a warning to all His people. In fact, after the pre-trib rapture there will no doubt be a great repentance and revival! Many prophecy teachers are in great danger of being left behind because they are dogmatically proclaiming that no Christian should be praying to escape what is coming! They do this in the face of the plain words Jesus Christ commanded to His disciples (the foundation stones of the "Church", Eph.2:20)

Will I be left behind? I do not know. I do know that the moment I start "knowing absolutely" that I stand and will be going in the pre-trib rapture, is the same moment I am in most danger of being left behind. I can only "hope" to escape the purifying fires of the Trib. I can only pray always to be accounted worthy of it by practical grace, working in me maturity and holiness.

I also guess that the more loudly it is spouted forth by would be prophecy teachers, that "all" saints will be raptured (whether they are worthy of a crown or not) the more they provoke the wrath of their Lord, and tempt Him to smite them for such presumption! (2Peter 2:10, Mtt.18:6)

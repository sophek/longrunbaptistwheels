THE GODDESS AND THE BEAST! (PART 2)
*****************************************

In the first part of this study, we have noticed how ancient paganism and its goddess worship are being revived today, in both Catholicism, and the European Union (i.e. its symbols, stamps, coins, flag, anthem, etc.). In this second part, I want to call the reader's attention to the fact that the various "manifestations" and "communications" of the devilish "goddess" (usually disguised as Mary) are designed to carefully prepare the world (and especially the "religious" world, that has some degree of familiarity with the Scriptures), to accept THE ANTICHRIST under the presumption that he is Jesus Christ! It appears that the evil spirits are actually preparing for the predicted events of the Book of Revelation by launching their own interpretations of the prophetic Scriptures. By devilishly and erroneously rearranging the chronology of events, they are prepared to proclaim that when the Beast arises, that it is actually the Second Coming. And when the seducing miracles are performed by the false Christs, etc., they have prepared millions to believe that these are the wonderful events associated with the second, last, great Pentecost! And the preparation and deception does not stop there. They are already preparing to counterfeit Revelation chapter 20, which reveals the first resurrection and the thousand-year reign (the Kingdom of God).

Before taking a look at these evil, subtle deceptions, let us notice the underlying methodology by which the Devil is operating. It is based on his classic device of taking Scriptures out of context, and perverting the chronology. For example, notice the words of Revelation 22:

Revelation 22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
4 And they shall see his face; and HIS NAME SHALL BE IN THEIR FOREHEADS.

Paul has assured us that these wonderful days (whether the Millennium or the Eternal State) cannot come until the great deception and falling away occurs (2 Thessalonians 2). But many will be deceived, as they seek for only smooth things and positive things, and they will believe the lie that the Antichrist has in some sense past already. The Devil will then use Revelation 22:4 to explain and justify what will actually be the MARK and/or NAME OF THE BEAST!:

Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or IN THEIR FOREHEADS:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the NAME OF THE BEAST, or the number of his name.

This is another reason why Preterism in all its forms is evil and dangerous. It is one of the means by which the Devil will erase the warnings in Revelation 13 from the Bible. With this understanding, let us begin to examine the detailed manner in which evil spirits are preparing millions to believe that the rise of Antichrist and his deceptions are actually the fulfillment of other "positive" prophecies in the Scriptures!

THE JAPANESE MARIAN REVELATION

On October 13, 1973, a message from "Mary" was revealed to Sr. Agnes Sasagawa at Akita, Japan, and it was approved by the local bishop:

"As I told you, if men do not repent and better themselves, the Father will inflict a terrible punishment on all of humanity. It will be a punishment greater than the Deluge, such as no one will never have seen before. FIRE WILL FALL FROM THE SKY and will wipe out a great part of humanity, the good as well as the bad, sparing neither priest nor faithful. The survivors will find themselves so desolate that they will envy the dead. The only weapons which will remain for you will be THE ROSARY AND THE SIGN left by my Son. Each day recite the prayers of the rosary. With the rosary, pray for the Pope, the bishops, and the priests... Pray very much the prayers of the rosary. I ALONE AM ABLE STILL TO SAVE YOU from calamities which approach. Those who place their confidence in me will be saved."

Notice that this evil spirit is first preparing "the faithful" for the Tribulation Period, when the calamities in the Book of Revelation will be poured out on humanity. However, the devils will scream forth through their images and channelers, that the REASON the calamities have arisen is that the "Father" desires more allegiance to IDOLS such as "Mary"! Thus, they are ALREADY preparing the world to believe the OPPOSITE of what the true God desires the world to believe. God is angry with the world, and will continue to be, for its IDOLATRY (Revelation 9:20). And He will punish the world for it by great calamities and disasters. But instead of repenting, most will believe some lie. Catholicism's "faithful" (and those who believe her "visions" and "communications") will already be prepared to believe that they must give Mary greater devotion, and say the blasphemous Rosary, to be saved from the disasters!

THE THIRD SECRET OF FATIMA

In the year 2000, the long-awaited final text of the Third Secret [of Fatima] was revealed by the Vatican. What was this great secret? It was a vision of a man dressed in white who "moved through a ruined city full of fallen bodies on his way up a hill towards a cross. Upon reaching the cross, he was shot down by soldiers and apparently died." "When asked: 'Is the principal figure in the vision the Pope?,' Sister Lucia replied at once that it was....Sister Lucia continued: 'We did not know the name of the Pope; Our Lady did not tell us the name of the Pope; we did not know whether it was Benedict XV or Pius XII or Paul VI or John Paul II; but it was the Pope who was suffering and that made us suffer too.'" (Vatican Web Site)

The Third Secret has been interpreted to refer to the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II, when he says he was saved by Mary. But they appear to have left the actual name of the fallen Pope open for a future time. Will this revelation at Fatima be used to explain the Antichrist's "wound" of Revelation 13:12,14? If so, then we can see that the world will be immersed in false visions and revelations as the Devil seeks to neutralize and oppose the clear prophecies of the Scriptures in these last days.. Jesus predicts that "many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many" and that "many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many" (Matthew 24:5.11).

FUNDAMENTALISTS: AN EXPLOSIVE DANGER?

This Satanic preparation will include not only counterfeiting the Scriptures and misinterpreting them, but also the branding of "fundamentalists" (those who will understand the prophecies and be able to expose the deceptions) as the greatest danger and threat to the world! Notice how the new Pope does not waste any time in setting up the world to hate and despise fundamentalist Christians:

"I wish to reiterate the steadfast resolve of the Holy See to continue serving the cause of peace. The very name Benedict, which I chose on the day of my election to the Chair of Peter, is a sign of my personal commitment to peace. In taking this name, I wanted to evoke both the Patron Saint of Europe, who inspired a civilization of peace on the whole continent, and Pope Benedict XV, who condemned the First World War as a 'useless slaughter' and worked for a universal acknowledgment of the lofty demands of peace....RELIGIOUS FANATICISM, today often LABELED FUNDAMENTALISM, can inspire and encourage terrorist thinking and activity. From the beginning, John Paul II was aware of the EXPLOSIVE DANGER represented by fanatical fundamentalism, and he condemned it unsparingly....With confidence and filial ABANDONMENT let us LIFT UP OUR EYES TO MARY, Mother of the Prince of Peace. At the beginning of this New Year, let us ask her to help all God's People, wherever they may be, to work for peace and to be guided by the light of the truth that sets man free. Through Mary's intercession, may all mankind grow in esteem for this FUNDAMENTAL good and strive to make it ever more present in our world, and, in this way, to offer a safer and more serene future to generations yet to come."
(From the Vatican, 8 December 2005. BENEDICTUS PP. XVI)

In the last line, the Pope must have forgotten how dangerous fundamentalism is, since he calls peace a "FUNDAMENTAL" good! Notice, he makes no distinction between Islamic fundamentalists who are often suicide bombers, and Christian fundamentalists, who are armed only with Bibles and seek to evangelize Catholics. This is by design. Whether it is Jimmy Carter's new book, or the Pope's latest address (or the Muggles in Rowling's Harry Potter), the world is being prepared to believe that unless CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS are stopped, the world will continue to experience and increasing amount of turmoil and disasters. The Devil is justifying the great persecution of believers that will soon take place in the Tribulation Period. They will be pronounced guilty of "hate crimes" and the "goddess" will announce that they must be put to death or cosmic disturbances will continue.

THE INCREDIBLE GOBBI REVELATIONS

In 1972, Stefano Gobbi, a priest from Milan, Italy, joined in a pilgrimage to Fatima. While he was praying in the Chapel of the Apparitions for unity, an inner voice urged him to place his confidence in the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These alleged "messages from Mary" (dictated from 1973 to 1997) are published in the book "To the Priests, Our Lady's Beloved Sons." (see http://www.mmp-usa.net/main.html) These messages have the Imprimatur!

The evil spirit who speaks to this false prophet declares that since the Second Coming of Jesus is close at hand, only those who consecrate themselves to Mary will be found to "have faith" when the Lord returns!:

"If indeed his return is close at hand, then my motherly action becomes more concerned and vigorous, in order to assist all my children to remain ever in the truth of the faith....Thus, when the Son of Man returns, He will still find the faith on earth in all those who will have consecrated themselves to me, allowing themselves to be gathered together in the heavenly garden of my Immaculate Heart."
(Message dated March 13, 1990)

The spirit communicates that "her times have arrived," and that a "new era of grace and holiness" is upon the world (i.e. a new era of idol worship).

The Marian Movement of Priests (http://www.mmp-usa.net) embraces these communications. They have chosen for their logo an image of Mary protecting the world:

"Look at Mary's hands. With the one hand she holds the world and presses it against her heart; and, with the other she protects the world and all humanity that was given to her by Jesus her Son, shielding it from harm and evil..."(http://www.mmp-usa.net)

Amazingly, the image is made up of three sixes (666), with one turned upside down!

"Mary" predicts a time of her future triumph:

"Oh, after my triumph, these messages will be a light for the whole Church; then all that I have done for you during these years will be understood!"

But this "triumph" will not occur until after a BLOODY time of "purification":

"You are already about to reach the most painful and bloody conclusion of the purification which will take place in these years, before the great triumph of my Immaculate Heart in the coming to you of the glorious reign of Jesus."

Now do not miss this. "Jesus" is going to reign in the triumph of Mary; but before this takes place the world will be purified in a great time of bloodshed. This sounds like the persecution of true Christians, who will expose the so-called "Mary" as an evil spirit.

The "apostasy" is said to be those who expose the lie. They must be eradicated:

"There will soon come a time when only those who are with the Pope will succeed in keeping the faith of my Son and being preserved from the GREAT APOSTASY that will be spread everywhere." (25 lm)

"These faithful children of mine will be called by me and formed for this great task: to prepare this world for THE GREAT PURIFICATION which awaits it, so that at last A NEW WORLD may be born, completely renewed by the light and the love of my Son Jesus, who will reign over all." (25r)

MARY WORSHIPPERS EMBRACE PREMILLENNIALISM

Stefano Gobbi has turned one set of alleged messages by Mary into another booklet. It is called, "The Triumph, The Second Coming, and the Eucharistic Reign," (June 24, 1996). In a sermon to fellow priests, on this subject, Gobbi stated:

"This message from Our Lady [December 24, 1978] is precisely about his Second Coming. 'His second coming, beloved children, will be like the first. As was his birth on this night, so also will be the return of Jesus in glory.'"

In other words, since Mary was involved in the First Coming, the evil spirit predicts that she will be involved in the Second Coming. But WHO will "Mary" really be preparing the world to receive? It will be the Antichrist, not the true Jesus. Gobbi continues:

"'When the Son of Man comes, will He still find faith on the earth?' (Lk 18:8) He will come suddenly, and the world will not be ready for his coming. He will come for a judgment for which man will find himself unprepared. He will come to establish his kingdom in the world, after having defeated and annihilated his enemies. Even in this second coming, the Son will come to you through his Mother. As the Word of the Father made use of my virginal womb to come to you, so also will Jesus make use of my Immaculate Heart to come and reign in your midst...'" (166e-i)

Next, notice how Gobbi begins to stress the premillennial distinction between first, the return of Christ in glory, and then, the final Last Judgment, after the 1000-year Kingdom:

"Traditionally, we have always identified the return of Christ in glory with the 'Parousia,' when He will come as Judge, since there has never been any in-depth theological study on this topic. This is also the case for other truths which are believed, but about which no in-depth studies have ever been made. Of late, these messages which refer to Christ returning in glory to this world have given rise to a more serious theological study on this subject."

As he brings these priests into an understanding of premillennialism, he must cover up or explain the fact that this truth has been rejected by Rome since Augustine:

"A few years ago when I was in Spain, a priest, a theologian, gave me a book to have translated into Italian - unfortunately, I lost it somewhere along the way. In it, he showed how Sacred Scripture and the Fathers of the Church speak clearly of a glorious coming of the reign of Christ into this world, apart from the one at the end as Judge!"

I am almost certain that Jack Van Impe would be leaving his seat with applause at these words. Yet, this is no sign of true revival in these priests. It is a sign of how intricate and diligent the Devil is working to neutralize and pervert the premillennial truth. It makes sense that if the Devil (at least for a time) wants people to think that the Antichrist is Jesus, he must adopt a scheme of interpretation that allows for the presence of Jesus in the near future. While other prophetic schemes are useful to him to overthrow the faith of some, and remove the negative prophecies about Antichrist, etc., a modified form of premillennialism allows the Devil to counterfeit the resurrection, the last Pentecost (miracles), the presence of Jesus, and the Kingdom reign. The priest who gave Gobbi the book was correct in revealing how both the inspired Scriptures and the Christians in the first 300 years after Jesus, speak of a premillennial coming of Jesus to reign for 1000 years, before the final judgment begins. But this truth will be used by the evil spirit to explain why the Antichrist (who they will see as Jesus) is present in the world. Gobbi continues:

"Let us look at Sacred Scripture. Some passages therein are clearly of an eschatological nature - that is, they speak of the Last Judgment. In one of them, the Lord says: 'You gave the hungry to eat, the thirsty to drink, you clothed the naked, you visited [the sick]...This is the judgment - heaven or hell. Time is no more; the world is no more. But some passages of Sacred Scripture speak clearly of Christ's return ON THIS EARTH. I would like to point them out briefly."

Under popular Catholicism, the idea of Jesus returning to earth has been so confused and neglected that they must now be trained in a whole new way of thinking, if "Mary" will get them ready for an appearing of "Jesus." Catholics have radically over-stressed Heaven. Yes, they have certainly had their earthly "Vicar of Christ," and their earthly Kingdom. But their eschatology has always stressed Heaven (at least after Purgatory). This idea has even deceived many Protestants and Baptists, where the doctrine of reigning on earth in the Millennium has been denied or neglected as songs and sermons concentrate on Heaven (see "The Theocratic Kingdom," by G.N.H. Peters). Gobbi continues:

"First is the one I mentioned before: 'When the Son of Man returns, will He still find faith on the earth?' (Lk 18:8). In order to find faith on earth, He must return on earth, brother priests! But with the Last Judgment, the earth will be no more. There is only Judgment, and there is only heaven and hell - the world will have disappeared."

Gobbi misses the fact that after the Millennial reign, God comes down to a new earth, and dwells with men. But he is speaking to staunch Catholics, who have been raised for centuries on the concept of ONLY an eternal heaven. And he is arguing that there MUST be a premillennial return of Jesus ON EARTH. Now we begin to see why the Lord so often warned against anyone who looked for His return to be in the secret places or in the desert, or some other place in earth, other than a revelation in the SKY, as lightning. The Devil is preparing for a "return" before the Kingdom, and a "return" to earth. The evil spirit "Mary" is moving Catholics to premillennial ideas and concepts, for the purpose of making them think that the Antichrist is Jesus Christ. Gobbi proclaims:

"And also significant, brother priests, is the passage I mentioned before. (Rev 20:1-7) It talks about A GREAT PERSECUTION. Many will be killed during this persecution, but in the end the power of Satan will be destroyed, because Satan will be bound with a chain and will be cast into the abyss. Then Scripture says: 'The door of the abyss will be closed so that he may no longer harm the world.' (cf. Rev 20:3) Therefore, his power is destroyed! Then, some of those who died during the persecution WILL RISE AGAIN to reign with Christ. This will be the first resurrection, because the second one regards everyone. The first regards only some who died as martyrs, who will rise again to reign....Actually, Scripture says, 'to reign for a thousand years' - 'a thousand years' is a biblical term; it can also be a symbolic expression. However, aside from the specification of time, a fact is clearly described: Christ will reign after the power of evil has been destroyed, because Satan will be rendered powerless. This is Sacred Scripture."

Will this be used to explain the resurrection of Antichrist after he is slain? It appears that at the very time Satan will be raging the most, the world will be deluded into thinking he has been bound by "Mother Mary" and "Her Son." Gobbi continues:

"Brother priests...We must indeed open ourselves to this NEW PERSPECTIVE. I was told that the following question was addressed to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 'Is the return of Christ in glory to be interpreted as his return for the Last Judgment, or rather on this earth?' The answer was as follows: 'The Church has never taken an official stand on this subject, therefore one can interpret either way.' I have shown you the reasons for which, according to Scripture and according to the teaching of the Church, we tend to support the second interpretation - that the return of Christ in glory will take place on this earth. (Applause)."

And there it is! They have enthusiastically applauded the "new perspective." Now that the Devil is about to bring about his son of perdition, he is changing gears. He intends to utilize the prophecies for his own worship, and he impersonates Jesus and counterfeits the Second Coming! Gobbi continues:

"At this point it is appropriate to ask ourselves: what will this return consist of? How many elements will it have? There are so many - all of them most wonderful...Brothers, let us try to understand: what does 'return' mean? Christ is in heaven; He is returning because, in his human nature, He has already come. He is returning in a relative sense, since, with his divinity, Jesus is already present in the Eucharist. He is returning insofar as He will manifest Himself to this world in a glorious way and will bring his Kingdom to this world. Therefore, his Coming will coincide with the union of several elements: ...the definitive victory of Christ, when He returns in glory, will consist in completely destroying the power of Satan in this world, so that this world will be able to receive his Kingdom, and once again glorify the Father in a perfect way, as it was at the beginning of creation..."

Gobbi continues:

"There is a mystic, Luisa Piccarreta, whose cause for beatification is in progress, who wrote great works about the Divine Will. When I was in Mexico, I was given some of these writings which relate to numerous aspects described in our book ["To the Priests..." I was impressed by them...It says that every two thousand years there has been a great renewal. Two thousand years after creation there was the deluge of water. Two thousand years after the deluge of water, there was the deluge of blood: the redemption. After two thousand years there will be the deluge of fire - a spiritual fire, I think - and finally, the Kingdom of the Divine Will will come upon earth, because every creature will fulfill the Divine Will in a perfect way."

Therefore, we see that evil spirits are sensing that the time of judgment is near, and they are preparing for the Great Deception!

Next, Gobbi prepares for the FALSE MIRACLES OF ANTICHRIST:

"Brother priests....this cannot happen, except by a most SPECIAL OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: the Second Pentecost. Then, fire will come down; the Holy Spirit will descend - tongues of fire, spiritual tongues! Understand that the Second Pentecost, as the bishop said this morning, is not an invention of Don Stefano [Gobbi]. Pope Paul VI, John XXIII and the current pope have prophetically spoken about it. Why the second [Pentecost]? Because the first already took place...The second will take place on a worldwide scale; it will descend upon the whole world...Brother priests, [Jesus' return in glory] will coincide, then, with the miracle of the Second Pentecost, which will renew...[souls]. But do you understand that, by bringing the gift of the renewal into souls, it brings the gift of salvation? [Mary says]: 'In this way, the miracle of the Second Pentecost will take place. It will come with the triumph of my Immaculate Heart in the world...' (546hi) '...the civilization of the children of God who live in his kingdom - THE NEW CIVILIZATION OF LOVE....' In a message, Our Lady says that through her Immaculate Heart, universal peace will take place and the unity of the Church will be achieved. Finally, after so many years of division, and after so many (almost useless) efforts of ecumenism, the unity of the Church will be achieved and we will truly have the Eucharistic Reign of Christ within us....it will be a paradise on earth, which Our Lady is preparing for us through the triumph of her Immaculate Heart in the world. Praised be Jesus Christ!"

At this time, the world, and the false and compromised churches, will reach a climax in the "civilization of love." The evil spirits have been working hard to bring deception (especially upon women), so that any and all manly exposing of error and sin is opposed as "unloving." This falling away to Satan's brand of secret love (Proverbs 27:5) will end in GODDESS WORSHIP - the exalting of the MATERNAL over the PATRIARCHAL. This will continue until the deceiving miracles break forth in fullness, and "Mary" tells the world that this is the "Second Pentecost." The Antichrist will resurrect (the first resurrection), and "Mary" will call for the worship of the man who will be seen as both her son and husband! And finally, he will no longer need such supports, and Rome will be destroyed to make way for his Antichristian kingdom of Satan worship.

How should we respond?: "Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry" (1 Corinthians 10:14); instead of embracing books and doctrines written by seducing spirits, let us rather expose them. And finally, strengthen the hands of preachers who are countering and exposing the spirits of this age, and do not hinder their work because your own need of repentance and change has been exposed. Find our where God is working and get involved. You will not lose your reward! Get back to Bethel. Time is wasting. Your life is wasting. And you may not have another day.

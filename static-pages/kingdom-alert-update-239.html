-The Lord's Day: Assembling ON It. Rejoicing IN It! (Sermon By Joey Faust)

-Happy Mother's Day! (Words from T. DeWitt Talmage)

-Radio Announcement

-Chattanooga Conference is approaching!

==============================================================

May the Lord bless all the mothers!:

"A patient, loving, Christian demeanor in the presence of transgression,
in the presence of hardness, in the presence of obduracy and crime, is an
argument from the throne of the Lord Almighty, and blessed is that woman
who can wield such an argument. A sailor came slipping down the ratline
one night as though something had happened, and the sailors cried, 'What's
the matter?' He said, 'My mother's prayers haunt me like a ghost.' Home
influences, consecrated, Christian home influences, are the mightiest of
all influences upon the soul. There are men who have maintained their
integrity, not because they were any better naturally than some other
people, but because there were home influences praying for them all the
time. They got a good start; they were launched on the world with the
benedictions of a Christian mother. They may track Siberian snows, they
may plunge into African jungles, they may fly to the earth's end - they
cannot go so far and so fast but the prayers will keep up with them."
(T. DeWitt Talmage, "My mother's prayers haunt me like a ghost")

The Lord's Day: Assembling ON It. Rejoicing IN It! (Sermon By Joey Faust)
****************************************************************

This study examines the history and validity of Sunday as the Lord's Day,
and the arguments used against it by some who keep the Jewish Sabbath. It
also exposes the goals of Satan to tempt as many Christians as possible,
in these last days, to forsake formal, regular, church attendance.

Wherever two or more faithful Christians are gathered in the name of
Jesus, the Lord is present among them (Matthew 18:20). This verse shows
the importance of small-group prayer meetings. We need to have more of
them. But it is part of the general apostasy and spiritual seduction of
the age for Christians to willfully substitute these small, informal
gatherings for the ordained, regular assembly of Christians as a New
Testament "church." "Home" is not "church," unless a real, God-ordained,
New Testament church happens to use the home for the formal assembly:

1 Corinthians 14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their
husbands AT HOME: for it is a shame for women to speak IN THE CHURCH.

Women may speak and pray openly at home, and at small gatherings. But they
are to be silent "in the church." Christians should go to "church"
(hopefully a strong one) at least once a week. Christians who forsake
church are in sin (unless they are like the thief on the cross who could
not be baptized; in other words, God understands emergencies and
exceptions when they are legitimate).

Chapter 4 of 1 Thessalonians exhorts Christians to "abound more and more"
in pleasing God through obedience to His commandments:

1 Thessalonians 4:1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort
you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk
and to please God, so ye would ABOUND MORE AND MORE.
2 For ye know what COMMANDMENTS we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

There is a similar phrase found in the context of one of the most
important, foundational commandments for Christians:

Hebrews 10:24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
good works:
25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
some is; but exhorting one another: and SO MUCH THE MORE, as ye see the
day approaching.
26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the
truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,

"So much the more," means that we should not only MEET TOGETHER MORE (in
formal assembly), but that such assembling is also SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
and necessary, the closer we get to the Second Coming of Jesus! Usually,
before the Devil can get a Christian fully immersed back into the world,
he must find a way to get him out of church - especially the one church
where he was feeling growing pains from the pruning work of the Holy
Spirit. It is therefore obvious that the adversary of our souls is working
overtime to tempt the saints to work overtime on Sundays! The Devil knows
that a Christian out of his church is like a coal away from the burning
coals.

Older pastors have testified to a change that has taken place among modern
Christians in regard to the Lord's Day. One pastor noted:

"I have been a pastor now since 1972 and have watched the erosion of our
Sundays over the years."

A recent article in WorldNetDaily states:

"Christian churches running on empty? Research indicates number of
Americans who don't attend services nearly doubling - Despite a 15 percent
rise in the U.S. population, a new survey shows the number of Americans
who don't go to church has nearly doubled in the past 13 years, rising
from 39 million to 75 million. The report by Barna Group, a
California-based consulting firm following trends related to faith,
culture and leadership in the country, says the percentage of adults that
is 'unchurched' has risen from 21 percent in 1991 to 34 percent
today....On a surprising note, while about half of the churched population
has accepted Jesus as their savior, one of every six unchurched adults (17
percent) has done so as well. Interestingly, says the report, if the
minority of unchurched adults who are born again were connected to a
church, the resulting increase would be nearly 13 million new people -
more than have joined the nation's churches in the past decade
combined...." (WND, May 6, 2004)

Preachers in the last days have a responsibility to directly expose and
oppose this dangerous trend:

2 Timothy 4:2 PREACH the word; be instant in season, out of season;
REPROVE, REBUKE, EXHORT with all longsuffering and doctrine.
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;

Exhort: "To incite to some good deed or course of conduct by appeal or
argument."
("Standard Dictionary," 1895)

Christians need to be exhorted (and some need to be reproved or rebuked)
in regard to the Lord's Day. My primary intention is to exhort Christians
to action:

1. I want to incite Christians who presently have Sundays off, to thank
God that you are not in a trial or temptation concerning Sundays. And in
meekness, consider yourself, lest you be tempted next by a lay off, and
end up being tempted to take a job that requires you to miss church. etc.
I want you to understand the seriousness of missing church, and therefore
pray fervently for those who do not have Sundays off.

2. I want to incite those who are currently being tried in regard to
Sundays, in whatever degree, to be diligent to find a job conducive to
Sunday assemblies.

3. I want to incite those who do not attend church because of doctrinal or
holiness reasons to move or drive to where there is a good church.

There are certainly various situations and degrees. I primarily want to
remind you of the principle of the SLIPPERY SLOPE. You know:

1."We cannot have a dog."

2. "Well, we can get the dog but he is staying outside."

3. "Well, he can come in, but he can't get on the furniture."

4."Well, he can get on the furniture, but he can't come in the bedrooms."

5. "Well, he can come in the bedroom, but he can't sleep on the bed."

I am sure many have experienced this sort of thing. Here is another
example:

1."We will not watch worldly movies."

2. "Well, we will not watch PG movies."

3. "Well, we will not watch PG-13 movies."

4. "Well, we won't watch R-rated movies."

5. "Well, okay. We won't watch anything REALLY Satanic or gory."

6. "Well, okay we will watch these gory, Satanic movies (to keep informed
culturally), but we will not let the children watch them."

7. "Well, okay. The children can watch these things. But we will not let
them imitate what they see in the movies."

Now notice the same slippery slope in regard to Sundays:

1. "Well, I'll only miss one service on Sunday's because of work, every
now and then.

2. "Well, I'll only miss the second, afternoon service every week, because
of work."

3. "Well, I'll only miss an entire Sunday, because of work, every now and
then."

4. "Well, I'll only be missing a series of Sundays, because of work, for a
little while."

5. "Well, give me another beer. Life is good when you are making money.
Who needs church? I might go back if I get down and don't have any more
money."

Yes, a "little while" can explode quickly into a "long while." Each time
we do something that is against our consciences or standards, it becomes
easier to do it again, and again. And then we begin to really slip and
fall.

What is happening? We are becoming more secularized as a society. This
brings extra temptations to the Christian to join with the world; and it
also brings changes in employers who only want to make more money:

1. As Christians have increasingly shopped and conducted business on
Sundays for non-emergency reasons, this has communicated to business
owners that the honoring of the Lord's Day is obviously only a mere
convenience - take it or leave it. And as more and more Christians have
been willing to compromise in regard to the Lord's Day, it has
communicated to the secular world that ONLY FANATICS would make a big
issue out of working on Sundays.

2. On one side, the Bible says that if a man does not work [willingly],
then neither should he eat. It also says that he that does not provide for
his own house [financially] is worse than an infidel (2 Thessalonians
3:10, 1 Timothy 5:8). But as we exhort men to diligently pursue work, and
seek financial stability and independence, we need to make sure we do not
fall overboard on the other side. As the old preachers used to say, "It is
never right to do wrong to get a chance to do right." If the Devil can't
keep everyone from working, he'll tempt everyone to forsake the assembly
by working too much, or, on the Lord's Day.

3. Sometimes, we are called to take a stand:

"O Boss, I am not careful to answer thee in this matter of whether or not
I can work this Sunday. If it be so, my God whom I serve is able to
deliver me from poverty and unemployment, and he will deliver me out of
thine hand, O Boss. But if not, be it known unto thee, O Boss, that I will
not join with the world and serve its gods of mammon, nor worship the
cares of this world." (paraphrased from Daniel 3:16-19!)

Often people will pray for an open door out of a compromised situation.
But often, the Lord's miracles do not come until WE ARE WILLING TO STAND
ON FAITH! What if Daniels' three friends had prayed like the following:

"Dear Lord, we are in a bad situation. You see, we are going to have to
worship a golden image. There is no other choice. The king said he would
kill us if we don't fall down and worship his statue. Oh what a bind we
are in Lord. We have been praying and fasting for your deliverance. But
You have so far been silent. Well, Lord, we are going to have to bow down
and worship this statue, but we sure do pray that You will get us out of
this bind. We don't LIKE having to worship images."

You can see the point. The Lord would have, no doubt, continued to be
silent if they had prayed like that. He would not have made an appearance.
No, the Lord met Daniel's friends with a miracle IN the fiery furnace,
AFTER they refused to compromise! The Lord has promised a WAY OUT of the
temptation, so we can get around it, or bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), but He
has never guaranteed us that He would provide us a way of escape without
us taking a proper, dutiful stand ON FAITH! God stopped the lion's mouths,
AFTER Daniel was already thrown into the den. We must often step out on
faith and walk on the water before He gives us the miracle to stand. The
Lord told a paralyzed man to get up and walk (Mark 2:3-4). Too often we
want the miracle BEFORE we act and take a stand. But this is not walking
by faith, it is walking by sight:

2 Corinthians 5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

But in contrast to these examples, we see that a whole generation of
Israelites told God that they could not go forward because the situation
was "impossible," and that their "little ones" could not survive. This is
the idolatry of the family. We are worse than infidels if we do not
provide for our own. But we are idolaters if we provide for them sinning.
The Lord answered their idolatry and lack of faith by saving their little
ones, and killing everyone of them! These things are written for our
admonition!

4. Sometimes wives are not willing to live a lower standard of living,
that the husband might have a job with Sundays off. They put a sinful
amount of pressure on their husbands, and insinuate that they will only
see him as a "man" if he is providing them with a certain standard of
living. But Christians have never been guaranteed that they will be able
to live WITHOUT FAITH. The just shall live by faith! By all means, we
should not be reckless and presumptuous. We should learn the financial
principles of Proverbs, and learn to save, tithe, give, waste not, be
prudent, be frugal, and be diligent. This will reap general blessings and
protection. But we have never been promised that such principles will
guarantee us a life without faith! There will be times when we must be
tried, and the only way we can appear to survive will be by compromise. It
is at such a time that the Lord will discover whether or not we will
manifest faith in Him. The love of money is the root of all evil. The
Bible says that in the last days they will not endure SOUND DOCTRINE.
Titus 2 teaches that part of SOUND DOCTRINE is wives being keepers at
home. What is the primary excuse of the two income family? "We want the
mammon and the extra pleasures." In the same way, there are many wives
that will pressure their husbands to take jobs where they will have to
work on Sundays, when they could easily take a lower paying job and have
Sundays off. But that may mean shopping at the "second hand" shop instead
of the mall, or getting out the sewing machine.

5. But sometimes it is not the women at all; it is the men who are
covetous or too proud to take another job where they can have Sundays
free. Saul once used the excuse that he did not slay all the sheep of the
Amalekites because he wanted to give the sheep as a sacrifice to the Lord!
Many say:

"Oh, but with this new job that requires me to work Sundays, I will be
able to do so much."

But the Lord's church hardly ever sees anything from such people. They
have "good intentions" and high hopes and plans, like most backslidden
people (see Judah in Genesis 38:1, 11, 26). But the money soon blinds them
to use their money on their own homes, cars, and projects (Haggai 1:4).
There are indeed a few that can make money and keep God's work first. But
they are rare. Money (and the pride and comforts that accompany it) often
dulls the mind to spiritual things, and pierces the soul with many sorrows
(Luke 21:34, 1 Timothy 6:10).

6. Sometimes, it is a situation where we have failed to follow godly
principles, and we are therefore put in a binding situation: "I must have
THIS job because I have so much debt." This is how debt can tempt us to
forsake the assembling. Herod decide to lust. But then he was put against
a wall when the daughter of Herodias asked for the head of the John the
Baptist Matthew 14:6-9). Oh, the king was "sorry." And most Christians are
"sorry" when they are backed up to a corner that they have foolishly
placed themselves in. It might not be any more right for them to forsake
the assembly than it was "right" for Herod to be honest and keep his
"promise" to the daughter of Herodias. But ignoring God's wisdom and
warnings certainly put them in a stinky situation where they are sorely
tempted. Sin always begets more sin. And righteousness begets
righteousness (Proverbs 21:21).

7. Sometimes, Christians who have placed themselves in a bind and have
willfully compromised are too lazy to do as Abraham's servant and GET IN
THE WAY, after they pray (Genesis 24:27). The Lord blessed Abraham's
servant IN his labor. In all labor there is profit. We want God to drop a
new job or the way out of our fix from the sky. But we had might as well
pray for our daily bread and hope that God drops manna or quails. The Lord
may do this is there is no other way. But often he answers the prayer by
giving us power to get wealth by WORKING (Deuteronomy 8:18). Christians
must know that the longer they drift along, the LESS they will be
motivated to stir themselves from their sinful lethargy. Sin can harden us
(Hebrews 3:13).

With these exhortations, let us now take some time to concentrate on the
doctrinal and historical basis of Sunday as the Lord's Day:

****************************************************
The Jewish Sabbath Not Revealed To Anyone Before Moses
****************************************************

Nehemiah 9:14 And MADEST KNOWN UNTO THEM thy HOLY SABBATH, and commandedst
them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:

No patriarch ever kept the 7th day sabbath. Abraham did not keep it. Jacob
did not. Job did not. It was not revealed until the time of Moses, who
wrote the words of Genesis 2:2. And then it was only revealed and given to
Israel:

Ezekiel 20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between
me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.

Babylon was never commanded to keep the Jewish sabbath. And Israel wa snot
commanded to keep just the sabbath DAY, they were to keep the seventh
MONTH, and the seventh YEAR, etc.

*****************************************************
The Jewish Sabbath Non-binding On New Testament Gentiles:
*****************************************************
Colossians 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing
it to his cross;
16 LET NO MAN THEREFORE JUDGE YOU in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
an holyday, or of the new moon, OR OF THE SABBATH DAYS:

"The [7th day] Sabbath was never given to the Gentile world....The Church
of Christ is not commanded to keep the [7th day] Sabbath....It was on the
Sabbath that Jesus lay dead in the tomb..."
(I. M. Haldeman, "The Sabbath," 1904)

***************************************************************
The Lord's Day is the New Day for New Testament Christians to Assemble:
***************************************************************

Mark 16:9 Now when Jesus was risen early the FIRST DAY of the week, he
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

Mark 16:2 And very early in the morning the FIRST DAY of the week, they
came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

John 20:19 Then the same day at evening, being the FIRST DAY of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of
the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be
unto you.

"Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week. John
particularly marks the time of this important event. It is the third or
fourth appearance of the Savior upon this memorable day." (People's New
Testament Commentary, 1889)

"This was the first day of the week, and this day is afterwards often
mentioned by the sacred writers; for it was evidently set apart as the
Christian sabbath, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection....Jesus
himself came and stood in the midst of them, having
miraculously, though silently, opened the doors"
(Matthew Henry's Commentary, 1706-1721)

"That one day in seven should be religiously observed, was an appointment
from the beginning....the first day of the week should be that solemn day,
was pointed out, in that Christ on that day once and again met his
disciples in a religious assembly. The religious observance of that day
has come down to us through every age of the church."
(Matthew Henry's Commentary, 1706-1721)

Acts 20:7 And upon the FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK, when the disciples came
together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the
morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being
fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down
with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.

"They came together on the first day of the week, the Lord's day. It is to
be religiously observed by all disciples of Christ...Sleeping when hearing
the word, is an evil thing..."
(Matthew Henry's Commentary, 1706-1721)

1 Corinthians 16:2 Upon THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK let every one of you lay
by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings
when I come.

"Upon the first [day] of the week. This shows that the first day of the
week was set apart and regarded by the church....All church history
testifies that the early church took up weekly collections on the first
day of the week."
(People's New Testament Commentary, 1889)

When Christians do not attend church on Sundays, most will never be
consistent in tithes and offerings. Therefore, the LORD'S work suffers in
the churches at the expense of private prosperity. The Lord often has to
remind His children that it is He that gives them the power. But why
should we wait until the Lord must SHAKE US to sobriety? It is far better
to move with fear while He is exercising patience. Let His goodness lead
us to repentance. But be sure, His severity is around the corner if we are
stubborn.

The Jewish Sabbath was also given to Jews as a memorial of deliverance
from Egypt:

Deuteronomy 5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of
Egypt, and that the LORD thy God BROUGHT THEE OUT thence through a mighty
hand and by a stretched out arm: THEREFORE the LORD thy God commanded thee
to KEEP THE SABBATH DAY.

Exodus 18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
done to Israel, whom he had DELIVERED OUT of the hand of the Egyptians.

The New Testament Lord's Day (Sunday) is also given to Christians as a
MEMORIAL of the deliverance wrought by the resurrection of Jesus:

Revelation 1:10 I was in the Spirit ON THE LORD'S DAY, and heard behind me
a great voice, as of a trumpet,

1 Thessalonians 1:10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom HE RAISED
FROM THE DEAD, even Jesus, which DELIVERED US from the wrath to come.

Romans 4:25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again FOR
OUR JUSTIFICATION.

Psalms 118 also prophesies of this new day:

Psalms 118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head
stone of the corner.
23 This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
24 THIS IS THE DAY which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad
in it.

The refused stone was the rejection and crucifixion of Jesus:

Acts 4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that
by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God
RAISED FROM THE DEAD, even by him doth this man stand here before you
whole.
11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, WHICH IS
BECOME the head of the corner.

"The stone is Christ. The builders are Jews...become the head stone of the
corner is Christ raised from the dead after His rejection...This day is
the day of the marvelous doing. The marvelous doing is the lifting of the
rejected stone...[Then] the day is the day of resurrection....this day is
the Lord's day....it follows that the Church, every Christian, is
commanded to keep the First day of the week as the Lord's day....Let us
turn to the First day of the week and prize it as never before, saying
with the inspired Psalmist: This is the day which the Lord hath made; we
will rejoice and be glad in it.'"
(I. M. Haldeman, "The Sabbath," 1904)

"We do not keep the seventh day, or 'the Sabbath' of the Law....We do not
rest in fallen creation; but in redemption, or the new creation. We rest
because Christ rested; and the Father rests in Him, as having completed
atonement. Our rest, then, is with God, on another day, and for another
reason that that under Law."
(Robert Govett, Govett on John, 1891)

We rejoice in the Lord and assemble on the Lord's Day, in obedience to the
prophecy in Psalms 118! It is the day of the new creation. The Jewish
sabbath is the day of "man fallen in sin." It is the day of a dead Christ
in the tomb. It is the day of SHADOWS (Colossians 2).

****************************************************
Extra-Biblical Witnesses Concerning the Lord's Day:
****************************************************

Did the Roman Catholic church change the day of worship from Saturday to
Sunday? Or was Sunday already observed by Christians centuries before
there ever was a Roman Catholic church? History is clear that the latter
statement is correct. Notice the dates on the following quotes:

"[This is] the LORD'S DAY, the day, the day consecrated to THE
RESURRECTION, the queen and chief of all the days."
(Ignatius, A.D. 107; Epistle to the Magnesians)

â€œWe observe the eighth day with gladness, in which Jesus rose from the
dead; and having manifested himself to his disciples, ascended into
heaven.â€
(Epistle of Barnabas; A.D. 120) 

"[The Christians] neither celebrated the Jewish festivals, nor observed
their [Jewish] Sabbaths, nor practised circumcision."
(Justin Martyr, died A.D. 160; Dialogue with Trypho)

"...on the day which is called Sunday, there is an assembly in the same
place of all who live in cities or in country districts and the records of
the apostles, or the writings of the prophets, are read as long as we have
time. Then the reader concludes, and the president [pastor] verbally
instructs and exhorts us to the imitation of those excellent
things....Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly,
because it is the first day on which God when He changed the darkness and
matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Savior on the same day rose
from the dead: for the day before that of Saturn He was crucified, and on
the day after it, which is Sunday, He appeared to His apostles and
disciples and taught them these things which we have given to you also for
your consideration."
(Justin Martyr, died A.D. 160; Apology, chapter 67)

"Today we celebrate the Lord's holy day."
(Dionysius, 2nd Century, A.D)

"On one day, the first day of the week, we assemble ourselves together."
(Bardesanes; A.D. 180, Book of the Laws of Countries)

"A true Christian, according to the commands of the Gospel, observes the
Lord's day by casting out all bad thoughts, and cherishing all goodness,
honouring the resurrection of the Lord, which took place on that day."
(Clement of Alexandria; A.D. 194)

"We solemnize the day after Saturday in contradiction to those who call
this day their Sabbath...We celebrate Sunday as a joyful day. On the
Lord's day we think it wrong to fast...."
(Tertullian; A.D. 200)

"The eighth day, that is, the first day after the Sabbath and the Lord's
Day."
(Cyprian; A.D. 250; Epistle 58; sec. 4)

"On the day of our Lord's resurrection, which is the Lord's Day, meet more
diligently."
(Apostolic Constitution; A.D. 250; Bk. 2, Sec. 7)

"But the Lord's Day we celebrate as a day of joy, because on it, he rose
again."
(Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, A.D. 306; Canon 15)

"They [the Jewish Christians] also observe the Sabbath, and other
discipline of the Jews...but on the other hand, they also celebrate the
Lord's Days, very much like us in commemoration of His resurrection."
(Eusebius, A.D. 324; Eccl. History, Bk. 3, Ch. 27)

"[Psalms 92:1 A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to
give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the
courts of our God.] The Word (Christ), by the new covenant, translated and
transferred the feast of the Sabbath to the morning light, and gave us the
symbol of true rest, the saving Lord's day, the first (day) of light, in
which the Saviour gained the victory over death, &c. On this day, which is
the first of the Light, and the true Sun, we assemble after the interval
of six days, and celebrate holy and spiritual Sabbath; even all nations
redeemed by Him throughout the world assemble...All things which it was
duty to do on the Sabbath, these we have transferred to the Lord's day as
more appropriately belonging to it, because it has the precedence, and is
first in rank, and more honourable than the Jewish Sabbath. It is
delivered to us that we should meet together on this day, and it is
evidence that we should do these things announced in the Psalm."
(Eusebius, about A.D. 325; Commentary on the XCII Psalm)

"The now know as the Lord's Day, the eighth, namely which is also the
first day of the week."
(Augustine, A.D. 400; Letter 55)

In the 19th century, Dabney writes:

"...the first day, was called by [early Christians] the Lord's day as they
said, because it was dedicated to the honour of Christ, and because it was
the head, crown, and chief of all the days. They also called it
Sunday...because, according to their interpretation of Genesis 1:3, the
sun was created on the first day of the week; but still more, because on
that day the brighter Sun of Righteousness [Malachi 4:2] arose from the
dead....The absolute necessity of the [Sunday] Sabbath, as a season for
the public preaching of religion and morality, as a leisure time for the
domestic religious instruction of the young, as a time for private
self-examination and devotion, is most clear to all who admit the
importance of these duties..."
(Dabney, "From the Seventh Day to the First")

"All Christians were unanimous in setting apart the first day of the week,
on which the triumphant Saviour arose from the dead, for the solemn
celebration of public worship. The seventh day of the week was also
observed as a festival, not by the Christians in general, but by such
churches only as were principally composed of Jewish converts, nor did the
other Christians censure this custom as criminal and unlawful."
(Mosheim)

And we will close with the dying words of John Bunyan:

"Have a special care to sanctify the Lord's day; for as thou keepest it,
so will it be with thee all the week long. Make the Lord's day the market
for thy soul, let the whole day be spent in prayer, repetitions, or
meditations' lay aside the affairs the other parts of the week: let the
sermon thou hast heard be converted into prayer. Shall not God allow the
six days, and wilt not thou afford Him one? In the church be careful to
serve God: for thou art in His eyes, and not in man's....Forsake not the
public worship of God, lest God forsake thee, not only in public but in
private."
("Mr. John Bunyan's Dying Sayings," d. 1688)

Let us resist the spirit of the age. The Devil wants to divide Christians
and get them off separate where they will be no good to others, and
receive nothing from the Lord's church. Let us REJOICE in the Lord Day.
And let's assemble ON it!

        <h1> WHY WOULD THE HOLY SPIRIT MIS-GUIDE THE TRANSLATORS TO EMPLOY THE USE OF MYTHICAL CREATURES LIKE SATYR?</h1>

            Why would the Holy Spirit mis-guide the translators to employ the use of mythical creatures like "satyr" for "wild goat", "cockatrice" for common viper, when today we know what the real name of these creatures is?

Answer: First of all, the writer is assuming that "satyr" has reference to a goat creature (it may). But the Oxford dictionary points out that the word is used to refer to any ape-like (1Kings 10:22) creature (not mythological). If the Bible does mean a stange "goat creature" that has some features like a man, it will be because the deranged people of the coming Tribulation period use their cloning to produce goats with human body parts! It would not have a human soul (no man can clone a soul), but there is nothing to say that man will not be able to mix genes and produce animals with human-like body parts. The KJV passages in Isaiah are PROPHECIES of the future. Therefore, Satyrs will indeed one day exist according to the Bible. Either we will rediscover these creatures (like so many other creatures), or man, through his insane, genetic research, will produce them. Otherwise, the word simply refers to any ape-like creature. Oxford shows that the word need not refer to anything mythological. With further research, one might even find that satyr was a common English word meaning "hairy goat." I often find that people who object to the KJV do not have a good mastery of English definitions. A good set of English dictionaries (I collect them) can solve about 95% of all objections to the KJV.

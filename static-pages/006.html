God's Control over Trials

Many of you ladies reading this are probably experiencing trials of some sort in your lives right now. I can pretty well guarantee this if you are a wife or if you have children! The Lord uses trials in our lives to refine us, to purify us, and to conform us to His image. Jesus wants His people to be holy and beautiful within, and He will never stop refining us until we take our last breath.

It is so good to know that we have such a powerful God! I have seen some people dance around the Enemy, speaking to him in the middle of their sacred prayer times as if he were powerful and in control, but the truth is, God is in control! It would make our lives a lot easier if we would just remember it.

Many times I have been hit with trials that I didn't feel ready for. But if at all times I would simply trust the Lord in His goodness and His perfect timing for allowing this trial in my life, I would certainly be much more able to withstand it, and grow because of it. The trials that are the hardest for me are the ones that I see simply as interruptions to my plans and therefore great irritations, instead of immediately laying the trial at the Lord's feet and trusting Him to bring a blessing out of it.

Recently a young lady in our church was experiencing a trial. Her wise and godly mother used this as a growing opportunity for her and told her "This trial is a great blessing for you because it is bringing out bad things in your character that you thought you already had overcome, and didn't know were there." She has since had the opportunity to thoroughly school her daughter in how to overcome these things. What a blessing this trial has been for her growth!

Psalm 46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

It doesn't matter how severe the trial is, the Lord promises us that He is with us the entire time! He will make it work for good for us. Though the very mountains of the earth crumble, the Lord will still be looking out for our best, and will make sure that the trial touches us no harder than what we need.

Romans 8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

There is no power on earth that can get in the way of the will of God for our lives. People tend to give "chance" a lot of credit, which is one reason they don't look immediately to the Lord in trials and may get angry or loose hope. God gives us the things He thinks you can handle, and brings about a refining in you that wouldn't come in any other way. Often this may come in the form of your husband or children. Sometime when the trial comes in the form of another person we get angry at them instead of looking for God to work in the situation.

God is pleased when we look to Him in our trials for help and deliverance. It honors Him and shows Him that we believe in His power as well as His mercy. He knows that if you come to Him in even the small things, you will give Him all the glory for the victory.

The Dangers of White Flour

Some of you who just read the title of this article may laugh and think "what in the world is she talking about?" Most of us grew up on refined white bread, white pastas and white flour cookies, cakes, etc., so what could be wrong with it?

Well years ago, if a person had to, they could live off of bread and water. Today, with the non-nutritive white flour that we make bread out of, we would soon die of starvation on such a diet. It seems that anytime man jumps in to make something that God made "better", he messes the whole thing up.

First, let me tell you what real, whole wheat flour is. A grain of wheat is made up of three different parts. The bran is the covering of the grain. The endosperm, which is the largest part of the grain, is mostly carbohydrate. Last is the germ, which is the heart of the grain. It is what sprouts when the grain is planted. It has most of the vitamins and minerals. It is rich in the B vitamins, vitamin E, protein, and minerals (especially iron).

When man makes white flour, he grinds the wheat, then removes the bran (fiber) and germ, and then uses a harmful chemical process to bleach the flour white. The product that is left is far from nutritious. Knowing this, they add small amounts of about 9 different vitamins, though they removed over 20. A cup of whole wheat flour contains 136.0 mg of magnesium, and white flour has only 28.0 mg. Whole wheat flour has 49.0 mg of calcium and 446.0 phosphorus, where white flour only has 18.0 mg and 96.0 mg. When I make pancakes, cookies, cakes and breads out of whole wheat flour, I know that I am making foods that energize and benefit the bodies of those I am feeding. Using white flour is in no way healthy. It is non-nutritive.

Whole grains also contain significant amounts of biotin, folic acid, inositol, pantothenic acid, chromium, molybdenum potassium and selenium.

If you just give yourself time, you will learn to enjoy the full taste of whole wheat.

The House of the Slothful Woman

(A revision and amplification I wrote from Proverbs 24:30-34 for today's modern woman)

I went into the house of the slothful woman, and into the rooms of the woman void of understanding: And, lo, it was all grown over with dirty laundry, and dust and grime covered the face thereof, and due to lack of care, the quality of all she owned was broken down. Her kitchen was a horror, with dishes piled high in the sink and on the counter tops. Her cabinets were dirty and unorganized, her refrigerator was also, and filled with rotted food. On the floor and every surface were crumbs and spills, and the garbage was full and overflowing. Her carpets were littered with dirt and specks, and every room was cluttered and out of order. She goes to bed late and wakes even later every morning, thus starting her day running behind. The thought of unexpected company fills her heart with dread, she rarely invites anyone over. Her husband is tired and worn, the slothfulness of his wife has given him much misery. Her children are ashamed to bring their friends home to visit, though slothfulness is now also a part of their own character. Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy dirty house come as one that eats bon bons and watches TV all day; and thy disorganization as a woman without cleaning supplies.

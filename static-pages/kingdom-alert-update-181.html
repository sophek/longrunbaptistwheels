<strong>THE BIBLE PREDICTS THE RISE OF IRAQ AS THE HAMMER OF GOD </strong>Â 
"From Nebuchadnezzar to Saddam Hussein, Babylon rises anew on the path of construction and glorious jehad." (http://www.babylon-festival.net/bablyonintfestivalenglish.html)Â 
According to the Bible, the future prophetic curtain of the tribulation period will open with Israel restored as nation, and Iraq as a menacing power ready to temporarily conquer the Middle East, if not the world (Habakkuk 1:6, Jeremiah 25:9, 50:23). The stage is largely already set today. It may be that God will not allow the West (drunken with such sins as abortion, homosexuality, and pride) to totally uproot Saddam. Or it may be that the removal of Saddam will, ironically, allow Babylon to continue to flourish under the U.N. Whichever scenario God uses, I believe that one thing is for certain: Iraq will go forth to conquer immediately before or immediately after the tribulation period begins. Perhaps if there is enough true repentance in our land, God will temporarily hold back His judgments, and keep Iraq at bay. Yet, we must not provoke Him by presuming upon His patience. He has many reasons to be angry with our land. There is a Biblical principle that states that the more light an individual or nation possesses, the more he or it will be held accountable (Luke 12:47-48, James 3:1). America is not modern Israel, even though the light of God's Scriptures has shown brightly in this land. However, since ancient Israel was a nation with more light than any other nation, and it was severely judged by the kingdom of Babylon when it grew stubborn, America (and the West) would do well to fear God and seek His mercy; especially in light of current events.Â 
The great image described in Daniel 2 refers to the four consecutive, ancient kingdoms that ruled Israel and most of the world directly before the time of Christ (i.e. Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome). These same four kingdoms are repeated in Daniel 7. The first kingdom in Daniel 7 (i.e. Babylon) is pictured as a lion (Daniel 7:4, Jeremiah 4:7, 50:17). This speaks of both the ancient and a future Babylon. Many prophecies have a DOUBLE fulfillment such as this. We can see an example of double-application prophecy in 2 Samuel 7:12-16. Solomon is the near, historic fulfillment of the prophecy. Yet, Jesus is the future fulfillment of the same promise (Hebrews 1:5, Luke 1:32-33). Other examples of double-application may be noted by comparing Joel 2:28-32 with Acts 2:16-21, and Malachi 4:5 with Matthew 17:11-13. Notice the double-application revealed to us by the wording in Daniel 7:17:Â 
Daniel 7:17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which SHALL ARISE out of the earth.Â 
18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.Â 
Daniel sees this vision in the final days of the first kingdom of Babylon (Daniel 7:1). Yet, God tells Daniel that Babylon (as well as the other three kingdoms) will yet ARISE in the future; He then links this rise to power to the time directly before the return of Christ to establish His kingdom. There are similar double-application prophecies concerning Babylon found in Jeremiah. After God uses the kingdom of Babylon as a hammer to punish the rebellious nations (Jeremiah 50:23), He then punishes that kingdom with utter desolation for its own transgressions:Â 
Jeremiah 50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be WHOLLY DESOLATE: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.Â 
This desolation did not occur in strict detail in ancient history. The city of Babylon was still flourishing in 331 B.C. when Alexander the Great entered it. There was even a church at Babylon in New Testament times (1 Peter 5:13). Saddam has been rebuilding the actual city of Babylon for years (see http://www.babylon-festival.net). Modern Iraq is certainly not "wholly desolate."Â 
There is another double-application prophecy concerning Babylon in Isaiah 13:Â 
Isaiah 13:13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.Â 
19 And BABYLON, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.Â 
20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.Â 
<strong>Prophecy Writers Who Looked for the Rise of Literal Babylon</strong>Â 
Prophecy writer, W. E. Blackstone, in 1915, took a tour of Babylonia and personally proved that Isaiah 13:20 was not yet fulfilled in his day. This prophecy must still find its complete fulfillment in the future tribulation period. It is at that time that the heavens will be shaken and the earth will remove out of her place (Revelation 6:13-14). In the face of any threat of war, there should be national prayer and humility before God. But how much more should we seek God in repentance when our enemy at hand is a nation that God has already used in past ages (and promises to use again) to punish proud nations?Â 
In conclusion, the following prophecy scholars likewise looked for a future rise of Iraq as a threat to the world in the last days. There words read like the modern newspaper:Â 
"There are TWO DESTRUCTIONS OF BABYLON: one of Babylon mystic....and one of Babylon literal...Babylon the city of old time reappears." (Robert Govett, "Govett on Revelation," 1861; reprinted by Schoettle, 1981)Â 
"I conclude, then, that such a great commercial city, different from all that now exist, will yet be, and that it will be old Babylon rebuilt." (Joseph A. Seiss, "Lectures on the Apocalypse," 1865)Â 
"We conclude, then, that the case of Babylon will be similar to [that] of Jerusalem...It seems, therefore, on every account likely that we may presently hear of projects to restore Babylon..." (G.H. Pember, "The Antichrist, Babylon, and the Coming Kingdom," 1888)Â 
"In the year 500 A.D., or 1,100 years after Cyrus, the celebrated Jewish Babylonian Talmud was issued, showing that it was still a seat of learning....this great city must once more be rebuilt." (H.W. Fry, "God's Plan in the Bible," 1880's)Â 
"...the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah cannot be fulfilled unless there is to be a future Babylon that shall be thus destroyed." (Clarence Larkin, "The Book of Revelation," 1919)Â 
"The Babylon of the past had great glories. called in modern times Irak-Arabi...Hillah, on the site of ancient Babylon, has thousands of inhabitants...the shepherd still watches thousands of sheep there. Before the Great War, Sir William Wilcocks, whose wonderful system of irrigation we have seen in Egypt, was in Mesopotamia about 1910 or earlier. He then predicted: 'It seems that the time has come for this land, long wasted with misery, to rise from the very desert and take her place beside her ancient rival, the land of Egypt.'...It was the belief of Sir William that Babylon would be 'the capital of the world, the finest city that man ever built.' Alexander the Great, had chosen this city to be the capital of his projected world-empire....Who will...build again, on an unprecedented scale, this coming, imperial world city? Who will do it?" (William F. Roadhouse, "Seeing the Revelation," 1932) "Â 
Herodotus, Book III, 159...states distinctly that when Cyrus took the city he neither destroyed the wall nor tore down the gates...Therefore the prediction of complete and everlasting solitude still awaits fulfillment....Nearly 150 years ago that satanically far-seeing man, Napolean Bonaparte, as is reported, said whoever held Babylon held the key to India and the world." (G.H. Lang, "The Revelation of Jesus Christ," 1945)Â 
<strong>Can America Remove Saddam Without God?</strong>Â 
I do pray that there are enough holy, praying Christians in the U.S., who have seen the writing on the wall (9-11-01), for God to shine His grace and mercy upon us. Perhaps in His longsuffering, since He is not willing that any should perish, He will allow us to enjoy liberty and peace. But proud America better get on her knees before God forces us there. With the war in Afghanistan, some military advisers have warned president Bush that the U.S. military needs more time, and that without the U.N., our military would be too taxed. Commentators like Walter Cronkite have recently stated that if the U.S. attacks Iraq without the U.N., our only ally would be Great Britain. And he believes that such an attack would usher in World War III. But is it reasonable to have other nations such as Russia as an ally against terrorists? We see what that former head of the KGB thinks about his own people. He just gassed a multitude of them to death in a hostage crisis, and boasted because he saved the rest. In totalitarian nations, people become numbers. And what about China? A recent letter from a pastor in China reveals the terrible persecution against Christians that is taking place in that nation (persecution.com). And certainly anyone can see the absurdity of allying with Muslim nations (who hate Israel), and may be financing and protecting terrorists themselves. The "ally" a nation needs in any war is the LORD OF SABAOTH. More time spent seeking Him, and less time spent gathering at the tower of Babel would benefit the whole world greatly.Â 
<strong>Is Saddam Destined to be a Modern Nebuchadnezzar?</strong>Â 
Habakkuk 1:6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that BITTER and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.Â 
7 They are TERRIBLE and DREADFUL: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.Â 
It may be Saddam who is the modern Nebuchanezzar; it may be one of his sons. Or it may be a new power that will soon occupy that ancient land of Shinar. Regardless, a great conqueror will arise from that land to persecute Israel at the start of the Tribulation period. He will not be the final ROMAN Antichrist. Yet, he will go forth to conquer with terror and bitterness. Historians tell us that the ancient Babylonians were so dreadful that they would put hooks in the mouths of captured enemy soldiers and lead them around like dogs. They would burn out the eyes of their captives (Jeremiah 52:10-11). We have certainly seen such fierce hatred in modern Islamic suicide bombers and terrorists. This same spirit also appears to be found in the modern leader of Iraq. His hatred for Israel and his cruelty are commonly reported. Is Saddam a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar? In one sense, it would not matter. The Bible teaches that whoever controls the land becomes the "king of Babylon":Â 
Ezra 5:13 But in the first year of CYRUS the king of BABYLON the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. Cyrus was the king of Persia.Â 
Yet, he had conquered Babylon. Therefore, Saddam Hussein, according to Scripture, is just as much the literal king of Babylon today as anyone has ever been. But it is interesting that he reportedly claims to also be a physical descendant of Nebuchadnezzar! Whether or not this is true, the last day's prophecies concerning the Babylonian kingdom will be fulfilled by whoever has control and is possessing that land. Notice that Saddam certainly possesses the SPIRIT of Nebuchadnezzar:Â 
"But Iraqis are angry over another indignity inflicted on one of the greatest sites of classical antiquity. Babylon's Gate of Ishtar and hundreds of other treasures were looted a century ago and now grace the museums of Paris and Berlin. Apart from the lifting of economic sanctions, Iraq has another demand on the West, the return of these masterpieces to Babylon....Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem in 587 BC and tore down the first Jewish temple. He built the hanging gardens and brought the city to the peak of its glory. Saddam Hussein makes no secret of his desire to seize the mantle of these achievements." (smh.com.au, May, 2002, London Telegraph)Â 
"Saddam's campaign to enroll the past in the service of future glory is obsessive. He has embarked on a giant project to reconstruct a version of ancient Babylon ...Saddam is widely portrayed as a latter-day Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th Century B.C. Babylonian ruler, whose memory the Old Testament has preserved as a conqueror of Jerusalem, the leader who carried the Hebrews into captivity." (Judith Miller and Laurie Mylroie, "Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf," 1990)Â 
"As a civil engineer who worked on several Saddam residences told NEWSWEEK last week, there's a lot of Saddam in every one of those buildings. 'Saddam was very much obsessed with his palaces,' said Entifad Qanbar, now exiled in the United States. Saddam likes to identify himself with the ancient King Nebuchadnezzar, not only because he built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, but because Nebuchadnezzar, as Saddam likes to say, 'was the one who brought the bound Jewish slaves from Palestine.' In Babylonian palaces, many of the bricks were stamped with the ancient king's sign. Now those in Saddam's palaces are stamped in similar fashion, with a drawing of the dictator, or an eight-pointed star, and the motto: BUILT IN THE ERA OF SADDAM HUSSEIN....Yusuf, a former bodyguard of Saddam's, spent 10 years serving in 20 of his residences before escaping in 1999 to Jordan. An unlettered soldier, Yusuf has difficulty describing the opulence he saw. 'Whatever there is in the whole world, these palaces have it.' He recalls as many as 5,000 security staff actively guarding the tyrant's mansions." (The Bulletin with Newsweek, bulletin.ninemsn.com.au, Oct. 9, 2002)Â 
"He has been an international bugbear since 1990, when he burst onto the world stage with his invasion of Kuwait. And despite his removal from the emirate by Allied forces, tales still abound of Saddam's arsenal of weaponry, his links with the al-Qaeda network and his insatiable hunger to topple the West. One of his most senior military defectors, Abu Zeiinab al-Qurairy, watched the September attacks on television from his hiding place in the Lebanon, and reportedly commented, 'That's one of ours.'...In the subsequent ground assault, thousands of his soldiers were killed or wounded. The Shiites of southern Iraq revolted, but Saddam was somehow able to restore his grip, while in the north he attacked the rebellious Kurds. It was left to Western powers to create safe havens in both areas, and attempt to force the defeated leader to eliminate all his weapons. Even in this humiliated state, Saddam remained defiant. His continual refusal to submit to UN inspections of his national arsenal led to more Anglo-American attacks on Iraqi targets in 1998. Tony Blair explained, 'Just because we can't get into the cage, doesn't mean we should leave the cage untouched.'...His two sons-in-law attempted to leave the country, and were executed on their return. Meanwhile, his son Uday is being groomed for power, and continues to wield the axe of fear handed him by his father...His features and monuments are all over Iraq. He has even had Nebuchadnezzar's palace rebuilt, with his own name printed on every brick. The West may continue to call for his overthrow, but Saddam Hussein goes on, as defiant and brutal as ever." (BBC.co.uk, Profile, Oct. 30, 2002)Â 
The above reports are from secular sources, not Bible prophecy web sites! Exactly how close we are to the fulfillment of Bible prophecy concerning Babylon, we cannot say. But the stage-setting signs are so ripe and abundant, that we should tremble in repentance and anticipation as we watch for the coming Saviour.Â

<strong>JOHN HINTON'S BIBLE RESTORATION MINISTRY</strong>Â 
John Hinton c/o 1737 Grace Lane Columbus, Ohio [43220] 740-226-3222 614-451-7043 jhinton@post.harvard.edu A linguistic-based ministry devoted to the reprinting of the King James Bible and Textus-Receptus-Equivalent Bibles throughout the world and to presenting a challenge to the efforts of publishers and apostate Bible Societies to pervert and distort the Word of God.Â 
My Credentials:Â 
-I am a born again, unregistered, independent Baptist and a strict, uncompromising, unapologetic, relentless, feisty and fierce defender of the King James Bible as the true, living and inerrant Word of God as it stands now, with no concessions having to do with nonexistent original autographs.Â 
-A scholar of Hebrew and Greek, who does not use his scholarship to "correct" the Bible, but only to defend it.Â 
-I am proficient in or knowledgeable of virtually every language relevant to early biblical translation (Aramaic, Syriac, Samaritan, Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Giothic, Latin and Old English, as well as French, Italian, Spanish, German and I possess elementary knowledge of several other European languages.Â 
-A professional translator and desktop publisher of Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Hindi, Urdu and other languages for translation companies, attorneys and corporations.Â 
-A former Ph.D. student in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilization Department of Harvard University.Â 
-A holder of an M.T.S. from Harvard Divinity School in Near Eastern and South Asian studies and a thorn in the side to the school's liberal radicals.Â 
-A holder of a B.A. in Arabic, Summa cum laude with Honors and Distinction, 2nd Major in South Asian Studies, Minor in Persian, International Studies Certificate from the Ohio State University.Â 
-I completed a "Year in India Program" in Benaris, India, where I studied Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit and Arabic.Â 
-Completed the Summer Intensive program in Hindi and Urdu at the University of Wisconsin. -Completed a Summer Arabic program at Yarmouk University in Irbid, Jordan.Â 
-I traveled extensively in India, Nepal and many other countries.Â 
-I am fast and proficient typist in several languages, including those of India and Arabic.Â 
I will be glad to discuss the issue of King James Onlyism with any sincere Christians who are confused on the issue and are uninformed as to the true differences between Wescott-Hort "Bibles" and the King James Bible. However, I will not waste my time with apostates and hypocrites who know the facts but have rejected the truth due to rebelliousness or disbelief in the inerrancy of the Bible. My First Goals Hindi is spoken by well over 300 million people. It is one of the top five most-spoken languages of the world. It is spoken mostly by Hindus who follow one of the world's most demonic religions. The 19th century Bibles were quite good except for a few easy-to-fix flaws (such as changing only son" to "only begotten son"), but they are out of print and next to impossible to find used. I want to reproduce this Bible first. Urdu is spoken by over 150 million people in India and Pakistan. It is mostly spoken by Muslims. It took me 20 years to even find an Urdu Bible that I could purchase and it is perverted. The out-of-print 19th century translation is excellent and it is the second Bible that I plan to restore to print. Other languages that used to have good Bibles before the societies attacked God's word in them include Pashto and Bengali...Other possibilities include Gujarati...and Punjabi.... This is a full-time job and I will need missionary support to be able to do it. Hundreds of millions of people have no access to true Bibles and these people matter to the Lord, and they should matter to us.Â 
Comments: Why not contact this brother, ask him questions, support him, and schedule him to do a translation seminar in your church? We should praise God for the rare man who can separate the facts from the marketing while getting an education in languages.

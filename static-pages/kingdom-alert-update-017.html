THE JAW-BONE OF AN ASSÂ 
<blockquote>â€œIn our day the Bible is assailed by scurrility, by misrepresentation, by infidel scientist, by all the vice of earth and all the venom of perdition, and at this particular time ministers of religion fall into line of criticism of the Word of God...â€˜But,â€™ say they, â€˜you donâ€™t really believe that Samson slew a thousand with the jaw-bone of an ass?â€™ Yes, as I think that the man who in this day assaults the Bible is wielding the same weapon!â€ (T. DeWitte Talmage)Â </blockquote>

IN THE NEWSÂ 

1. HOUSTON (AP) â€œIf you can't tell identical twins Michael and Richard Swartz apart, look them in the eyes. On Thursday, Bank United of Texas became the first in the United States to offer iris recognition technology at automatic teller machines, providing the Swartzes and other customers a cardless, password-free way to get their money out of an ATM. â€˜It knows you just by looking at you,â€™' says Ron Coben, Bank United's executive vice president. ``There's no card to show, there's no fingers to ink, no customer inconvenience or discomfort. It's just a photograph of a Bank United customer's eyes.â€™'Â 

Here's how it works. A customer has a close-up photo of his eye taken at the bank, and the picture is stored in a computer. When the customer goes up to the ATM to take out money, he presses a button to start an eye scan. The ATM then matches the picture of the iris with the one stored in the bank's database to confirm the customer's identity. To demonstrate, Richard Swartz, a 25-year-old Rice University graduate student, had his iris photographed by a bank employee. Minutes later, Swartz was able to withdraw $40 from his account, without inserting a card or punching in a secret identification code. Access denied. Then, Swartz's brother Michael took his turn at the machine. But since his iris didn't match his brother's, the ATM refused to give him access. Iris identification -- already used by at 11 banks outside the United States -- is expected to help reduce the use of cards and passwords, not only at the cash machine but eventually in many other kinds of financial transactions. â€˜This event clearly establishes iris identification as the emerging standard in personal electronic identification,â€™ said Robert Van Naarden, Sensar's vice president of marketing and customer service. `Iris identification is the most secure, robust and stable form of identification known to man. It is far safer, faster, more secure and accurate than DNA testing.' Several other U.S. banks are expected to unveil iris identification teller machines later this year...â€

[Comments: We are living in the days right before the Tribulation Period. No prophecies of that age are presently coming to pass. Nevertheless, we are seeing, like never before, â€œstage settingâ€ for that age. The Bible predicts that Israel will be a nation when the prophecies of the Tribulation take place:Â 

Luke 21:20Â And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.Â 

Since 1948, Israel has been â€œsetâ€ in place to begin fulfilling Trib Age prophecies.Â 

A few more of the many things the Bible predicts for the Tribulation Period are:Â 

*Strange, aggressive weather problems. (Lk.21:25).Â 

*An increase in violence. (Mt.24:10,12, Rev.9:21)Â 

*A revival of world-wide mysticism and sorcery. (Mt.24:11, Rev.9:21)Â 

All of these things are present now in such a manner that we know the world is soon to enter that prophesied age! The above news article is just one more example of why you need to get holy, sober, separated, prayerful and BUSY! The Bible predicts that in the Tribulation Period there will be a one-world government set up with totalitarian domination that will make Hitler and the Inquisition Popes look like advocates of free speech!:Â 

Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Â 

Almost 2000 years ago, the Bible predicted a day when a world government would be able to control the buying and selling of practically every person in the world. The eye recognition and other techniques that will soon be common place are not evil in themselves. Yet, it is sinister to think how fast we are moving toward a world that does not understand â€œfreedom of religionâ€ or liberty in general. And one reason the totalitarianism of the coming Tribulation Period will be viler than any other time in history is that evil men will have more technological power to control and dominate than ever before! Christ said that coming age would be as the days of Noah before the flood.(Mt.24:37) Not only will people be living in self-indulgence, they will be living in a day of great technological advancement. (Gen.4:22) Multitudes of â€œdevilsâ€ will come down to earth to insure that the new technology is used for the greatest of evils. (Gen.6:2, Rev.16:14)Â 

Are you saved? Do you know where you will spend eternity? The very Bible that predicted all these things is the same Bible that reveals the love of God. God sent His Son to become a Man to be punished in your place. Jesus Christ shed His precious Blood so you can be forgiven of your sins. You were born in Adam who fell away from God. The whole human race is fallen. Yet, Jesus Christ has come to redeem mankind. Are you a sinner? Will you take this free gift to cover your sins? Will you believe that Jesus Christ has paid the debt that you could never pay? Believe this good news and you are at that moment saved from an eternity without God! Do it now!:Â 

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Â 

2."Anyone who thinks the media has nothing to do with this is an idiot.'
CBS President Leslie Moonves (AP Television Writer, Wednesday, May 19, 1999)Â 

[Comments: When the world continually gets entertainment from violence, when it turns killers into heroes, it is not long before people start longer for the â€œreal thing.â€ I have said some strong words about people naming the name of Christ while sucking in the worldâ€™s filfth. Now here is the president of CBS exercising more discernment than the majority of Christians who try to justify their sick habit by claiming they can enjoy watching sin without becoming sinners! One day I went to a gas station. As I was waiting to pay, some mechanics came running into the room where the station had a TV set. The â€œtalk showâ€ announcer had said that they were going to show some bloody pictures from the car wreck that princess Diana was in. These mechanics were knocking over things to grab the volume control as they were hooting and hollering with their eyes wide open. They were so captivated with lust that they were oblivious to the customers. At that moment, the announcer came on and said it was just a joke to prove a point. The mechanics walked away kicking and cussing. The sad thing about all this is that everyone thinks it is the other guy who has this problem. Those who watch the worldâ€™s TV programming and movies think they â€œstandethâ€. (1Cor.10:12) May the Lord raise up multitudes of separated Christians who read holy books and forsake the worldâ€™s ways!]Â 

3. "It's really hard to tell if we're looking at things getting worse or not."
-Dr. Beth Doll, associate professor of school psychology at the University of Colorado at Denver (By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer, May, 19,1999)Â 

[Comments: Nothing like that good oleâ€™ â€œscientificâ€ wisdom from a psychologist! As another kid walks into school and starts shooting, she is convinced things have always been like this! I believe she has been listening to too much â€˜talk radio.â€™ When a bunch of faithful Christians disappear in the rapture, the quack â€œscientistsâ€ of the world will say, â€œPeople have been vanishing all throughout history. In fact, we have some records of people...blah...blah..., etc.â€ The world will not admit that the â€œnew ageâ€ does not work like good, â€œold-fashonied religionâ€ from the Bible. When kids blow up schools with bombs (instead of firecrackers) do you know who is left with egg on their faces? Psychologists! They have replaced the preachers in America for the past 50 years. No wonder psychologists have to live in denial!]Â 

THE VALUE OF READING BOOKSÂ 

1 Timothy 4:13 Till I come, give attendance to reading...Â 

2 Timothy 4:13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.Â 

â€œNo man has a right to bring up his children without surrounding them with books. It is a wrong to his family. he cheats them. Children learn to read by being in the presence of books. The love of knowledge comes with reading, and grows upon it. And the love of knowledge in a young mind is almost a warrant against the inferior excitement of passions and vices. A little library, growing larger every year, is an honorable part of a young manâ€™s history. It is a manâ€™s duty to have books. A library is not a luxury, but one of the necessaries of life. It is not like a dead city of stones, yearly crumbling, and needing repair; but like a spiritual tree. There it stands and yields its precious fruit from year to year and age to age...The art of writing and of printing, which is a sequence to it, is really the most wonderful thing in the world...The influence of books upon a man is remarkable; they make the man...Every family ought to be well supplied with a choice supply of books for reading...Parents should furnish their children the necessary means, opportunities and direction of a Christian education. Give them proper books...Bring them up to the habit of properly reading and studying these books. â€˜A reading people will soon be a thinking people, and a thinking people must soon become a great people.â€™...Dear reader, be independent and make up your mind what is best for you to read, and read it. master a few good books. Life is short and books are many...â€™There are many silver books, and a few golden books; but I have one books worth more than all, called the Bible, and that is a book of bank notes.â€™ The parent who lives for his childrenâ€™s souls will often consider what other books are most likely to prepare his little ones for prizing aright that Book of Books, and make that object the pole star of his endeavors...Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention...Good books are invaluable as a moral guard to a young man. The culture of a taste for such reading, keeps one quietly at home, and prevents a thirst for exciting recreations and debasing pleasure. It makes him scorn whatever is low, coarse and vulgar. It prevents that weary and restless temper which drives so many to the saloon, if not the gambling table, to while away their leisure hours. Once form the habit of domestic reading, and you will, at any time, prefer an interesting book, to frequenting the haunts of vice. Chief among the educational influences of a household are its books. Therefore, good sir or madam, wherever you economize, do not cut off the supply of good literature...make the old coat do duty another season...You may go without pies and cake...but if you care for your familyâ€™s best happiness and progress, you will not go without the best of books...â€
(â€œThe Royal Path Of Lifeâ€, 1882)Â 
WORDS WORTH REMEMBERINGÂ 

â€œIn view of the evidence already presented, as well as that yet to be considered, we believe that those who love Christ will be secretly translated to heaven even as was Enoch...The â€˜One true and unchanging Churchâ€™ (?) will immediately proclaim that God has answered her prayer for a clear sign from God by removing these missing people from the earth. Meanwhile, all Protestantism will be thrown into confusion, especially the Modernists. The cry of â€˜Mother Romeâ€™ will be: â€˜Come to the fold of the one true and unchanging Church under the true Shepherd of Christ,â€™ and the poor deluded souls will heed the call by millions. And back in the shadows we fancy we can see Satan, himself, the â€˜Father of Lies.â€™...â€
(G. Elgin Keefer, â€œDefinite Signs Of This Age Closingâ€, 1926)Â 

â€œI believe that the literal sense of the Old Testament prophecies has been far too neglected by the churches, and is far too neglected in the present day, and that under the mistaken system of spiritualizing and accommodating Bible language, Christians have too far missed its meaning.â€
(Bishop Ryle)Â 

â€œIt is tragic how many Evangelicals abhor responsibility truth. A striking example has just been given (Life of Faith, Dec.15th, 1948) by Dr. Basil Atkinson: â€˜The idea has sometimes been mooted that an overcomer is a special kind of Christian, though we all know people who believe such cliques exist today, yet only if they suppose themselves to belong to them! An overcomer is another name for a believer...â€™ Not only does such exposition baffle all comment, but the solemn warnings of our Lord and the Apostles, addressed beyond all challenge to believers, are made totally irrelevant to the church. What will such Evangelicals feel when they discover the truth at the Judgment Seat of Christ?â€
(D.M. Panton, March, 1949)Â 

â€œFew students of Scripture can peruse [Rev.17] without recognizing the lineaments of Rome in its principle symbol. On this point, the single fact that the Woman is said to be sitting on seven mountains (rev.xvii.9) is in itself conclusive. For the Apostle to whom the vision appeared was certainly intended to understand it; and in his days Rome was everywhere known as the Seven-hilled City, or the Seven Hills. Moreover, this designation was publicly and solemnly brought to mind once a year, towards the end of December, when the citizens celebrated a festival (the Septimontium, or Festival of the Seven Mountains), instituted in very ancient times, to commemorate the enclosure of the seven hills within the city walls. Still more decisive is the declaration of the interpreting angel, that the Woman â€˜is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earthâ€™ - a description that no one could have mistaken at the time. For as yet, in the reign of Domitian, Rome showed no symptoms of waning power, although a full century had elapsed since Propertius characterized her as â€˜The city, high on seven hills, that rules the boundless earthâ€™ (Prop.iv., xi.57).â€
(G.H. Pember, â€œMystery Babylon The Greatâ€)Â

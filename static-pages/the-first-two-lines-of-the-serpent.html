        <h1>THE FIRST TWO LINES OF THE SERPENT</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Christians would do well to meditate on the subtle devices the devil used on the first man and woman in that ancient Garden. As we expose these devices (and show them "applied" to this modern age) many are bound to get a bit angry and emotional. The devil likes that just fine. Genesis chapter 3 describes the first assault on mankind by the Serpent. It came on a man and woman at a time when they were in fellowship with their Creator. This fact alone should cause every obedient, seeking Christian to stop and think about the "wiles" the devil used. The devil has not changed his methods. (2Cor.2:11)

The devil's first deception had to do with God's perfect Word; his second, with the "fear of God." The Bible warns of much deception increasing as the end grows nearer. It is no wonder then that many Christians in these deceptive last days have fallen "head over heels" doctrinally for the first two devices the devil ever "pulled" on mankind.

In history past there has always been a steady abundance of "responsibility truth" among premillennialists. Many saints throughout history have thundered against sin and warned Christians of judgment for sloth and rebellion. They knew how to give the Biblical warning passages (addressed to believers) their due weight without contradicting the precious doctrine of eternal security through faith alone. But since the invasion of the flowery, self-loving, touchy-feeling, psycho-babbling theology of the 1960's, many modern Christians would not dare hurt that fragile self-image of Laodicean saints by telling them that they really have anything to fear at the Judgment Seat of Christ! (2Cor.5:9-11, Heb.10:26-31)

On one front, the devil has done all he could to keep Christians from recognizing that God has restored to His seeking people a perfect Bible in the universal language of end-times. With the other side of his tongue, the devil has been striving to make sure that Christians reject the revival of "responsibility truth" that has been thundering within premillennialism since its great revival around the 17th century.

The First Device Of The Devil

If one is saved and seeking to "walk with God," the devil will attempt to mess up his mind in at least two crucial areas before seducing him to other great acts of rebellion. The first thing the devil will do is attack the Christian's "final authority":
<blockquote>Genesis 3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</blockquote>
The devil will not come slithering up to the Christian with a mythological pitchfork. He walked warmly up to Eve in the form of a kind, "ox-like" creature.(Gen.3:14) He gazed at her with those big, brown "cow-eyes" and began to speak. (I suppose animals could talk then.) He didn't come to her as an Atheist; he affirmed his belief in the existence of God. (This is an important lesson for the modern, gullible Christian.)

Notice also that the devil started off as a very "positive" preacher with his "yea." ("But honey, he sounds like such a nice cow. He is so positive. And he believes in the Lord.")

The devil will not always deny final authority outright; he simply questions it. For example, he will give modern believers "bibles" laced with a few lines like the following:

"Most reliable authorities tell us that by looking in most of the reliable manuscripts one can pretty much reliably conclude that this unreliable verse probably shouldn't even be in your very reliable bible version! But in case you should ever be troubled by its removal from this reliable text (due to your unfortunate exposure to one of those uneducated, insane KJV-Onlyites!) we did stick it way down here at the bottom of the page."

"Hath God said?" The devil "certainly" desires that you doubt or wonder. Why is it so hard for people to see that the devil is behind these new "bible" versions? (I know it is those "common" people who believe the KJV is the preserved Word; but do you remember who recognized and accepted Christ as the Messiah? And do you remember who accused Him of blasphemy? Try to think about it without looking. If you still can't get it, you may look it up in the following verses: Mk.12:37, Mtt.9:3) What does one have to see before one will believe it? The devil is certainly busy seducing modern churches with those ancient devices he first used on Eve:
<blockquote>"In 1988 Zondervan and the NIV was purchased by Harper &amp; Row Publishers (now HarperCollins Publishers). HarperCollins publishes 'pro-homosexual' books such as Making Out, The Book of Lesbian Sex and Sexuality described as 'Beautifully illustrated with full-color photography,. . . Making Out is the complete illustrated guide to lesbian sexuality and relationships. . .the intricacies of love play. . .' and many other pro-homosexual books! HarperCollins is a subsidiary of the global media empire, The News Corporation, owned by Rupert Murdock. The News Corporation empire include Fox Broadcasting, Twentieth Century Fox, and more than 128 newspapers. Fox Broadcasting produces some of the most sexually lewd shows on television. Murdock also publishes the British newspaper, the Sun, notorious for its nude pin-ups. Now where is Don Wildmon when we really need him? Don was quick to boycott Kmart because subsidiary, Waldenbooks sold Playboy and Penthouse. Kmart can't 'hold a candle' to the 'filth' spewed by The News Corporation. Why isn't Don boycotting Zondervan and the NIV? Friend, every time you purchase the NIV you are giving to people who produce pro-homosexuality, and pornographic material."Â (Dial-the-Truth Ministries tract)</blockquote>
That's the kind of stuff churches let themselves participate in when there is no longer one final authority among the people. Why would a Christian support such devilish businesses with their money?

We live in an age of weak, delicate men whose churches are led by radio and television preachers and Christian "best-sellers." Don't they realize that the majority of radio and television stations censor the content of their programs in order to please a broader spectrum of people? How can truth survive in that type of system? Truth divides and cuts. It is not a crowd pleaser. As long as churches will let the world of business dictate to them what is "fundamental," they will never be "straight" in regard to final authority or any other crucial issue that hurts "big business."

Not very long ago, whenever a popular preacher occasionally went to "correct" the Bible from the pulpit, he had to say:

"Now in our Bible it reads...However the Revised says..."

Whenever Maclaren or some other preacher used that line we know what Bible the people were reading! You didn't have as much fornication, adultery, divorce, drunkenness, hate, sodomy, greed, lust, immodesty, etc. as you do now did you? In this day and age the "people" have many different "flavors" to pick from and it is creating nothing but confusion, disorder and sin. (1Cor.14)

Recently, I was listening to a Christian talk-radio program in my car. They were featuring some great "apologetic warrior" who had just written a book on the subject of defending the faith. The program continued: "Doctor, for any of our listeners out there...Can we really know the Bible is God's Word?" The preacher first responded with that stuff about those qualified museum authorities who assure the Christians that their "Bible" is "more reliable" than Homer and other ancient writings. As I made my way toward the radio knob, he began to get zealous and emotional and affirm something like the following:
<blockquote>"The Bible tells us that Christ showed Himself by many infallible proofs! (Acts 1:3) Glory to God! We can know infallibly that we have a reliable source of truth."</blockquote>
I didn't know whether to chuckle or cry. It wasn't just his "Orwellian double-speak" that astounded me. It was the verse he quoted as the foundation of his whole "stand." It was "classic" KJV Scripture:
<blockquote>Acts 1:3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</blockquote>
Imagine the doubt (Gen.3:1) as many ran to their "bibles" only to find that the verse quoted by the doctor was only something he had memorized in Sunday-school as a child in the KJV, at a time when all the people read the same Book! The NIV and NAS teach that the evidence was only "convincing." The word "infallible" appears nowhere throughout those versions. The RSV and the ASV simply say "proofs" leaving out any adjective at all, while even the corrupt NWT strains out "positive proofs."

The first device that the Serpent uses to entice Christians to sin is manifested in the first few pages of the Bible, and it is very clear. Appearing as an angel of light, the devil seeks to get Christians to doubt whether or not a direct command was translated or copied correctly. He seeks to rob them of any Final Authority. "Are you sure God commanded that? Do you know the ancient languages? Do you know them well enough? Have you checked the other authorities? I have heard that Dr. Smug over at _____ doubts that translation. You are probably right; but are you sure? Oh well, let's get back to that tree we were looking at."

Have you picked up a standard commentary lately as an aid to finding out what the Bible means? (Eph.4:11) They don't really know. The poor souls haven't had the time to worry much about that. They are too busy trying to figure out what it says! And they are never quite sure about it.(See Gen.3:1)

Many Christians have indeed fallen for the devil's first device against them. As many disciples were slow to believe that Christ had resurrected, so are many today, slow to believe that God has preserved His Word in the universal language of end times.

Yet, this is not the only "hit" that many "conservative" churches have taken. Some are standing strong against the devil's first device, yet, sadly, they have embraced his second lie with open arms.

The Second Device Of The Devil

Do you think the devil is really finished after his first attack on final authority? No, he seeks to completely obliterate the human mind in its capacity to reason. True wisdom is found in God's Word; therefore the devil is quick to make that his first attack. Yet, the Bible also teaches that "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom..." (Prov.9:10) The devil will not have you wise. (2Thess.3:2, Jude 1:10) He therefore attacks at the two foundations of wisdom. He will first attack the Word of God and its absolute, final authority. Next he seeks to dismantle the fear of God in the lives of believers.

Do we really think the devil is through with believers? No, if he can't get churches with the first dart, he hopes to get them with the second. He is most successful when he can strip the saints of their armor with both devices and then launch all his various temptations to sin once the foundations have been adequately destroyed:
<blockquote>Psalm 11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</blockquote>
There is more than just the attack on the doctrine of "final authority" revealed in Gen.3. Read on. The devil speaks again! "Bible-believing" pastors would do their churches a great favor if they understood the second device of the devil and taught the saints to be on guard against it.

The Spirit seeks to revive truth and holiness among His people that they may resist the devil and continue to witness His saving grace to the lost world. This truth is found primarily in two real revivals taking place amidst the counterfeit nonsense that has deceived so many. It is springing up all over the world in independent, local churches. It is a counter defense of the Holy Spirit to the two devices the devil first used on Eve, and is continuing to use on believers today.

The devil attacked Eve as a believer, in fellowship with the Lord. Believers today can be sure that they will meet with the same attacks that Eve met with. Notice again, there are two:
<blockquote>Genesis 3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</blockquote>
There is the first. Now notice the second:
<blockquote>4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</blockquote>
Before the devil launches his arsenal of temptations on Eve, he first makes sure that he says two things two her. First he gets her to question and doubt God's Word. Next he attacks her fear of God. This second device of the devil has to do with "responsibility truth." He tempted Eve to doubt whether or not God would really punish sin like He said that He would:
<blockquote>Genesis 2:Â 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:Â 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</blockquote>
Christian you have also been warned. Will you believe Dr.Devil, Dr.Flesh or the Word of God?
<blockquote>Ephesians 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them. (See Lk.12:45,46)</blockquote>
<blockquote>1 Corinthians 3:Â 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?Â 17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>1 Timothy 5:24 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
(Compare 1Cor.11:30 with 2Cor.5:9-11)</blockquote>
Wake up children of God! In these last days the Holy Spirit is equipping the saints and empowering them to stand against the first two statements the devil ever uttered to mankind when they were in fellowship with their Creator.

The devil is busy as well. The devil desires that a "conservative" preacher teach church members that "King James Onlyism" is a divisive, silly doctrine for the simpleminded. He also desires that they preach to their church members that they will be raptured before the Tribulation regardless of whether or not they pray, watch or stay ready in holiness. (Lk.21:36, Heb.11:5, Rev.2:22, 3:10, 22:16,18) The devil desires that believers be told constantly that they will enter the Millennial Kingdom automatically and that they do not have to fear missing it at all! (Mt.5:19,20, 18:3, Heb.3:19, 4:1,3 &amp; 1Cor.10:11, 2Pet.1:11, Acts 14:22, Lk.18:24, etc.) The devil desires that  preachers throw the pre-trib rapture and the Millennial Kingdom into the same basket with eternal security: "Thou shalt not surely miss the pre-trib rapture or the 1000 year Kingdom."

Many modern preachers are like Balaam; they cannot (will not) see the "conditions" that are plainly given by the Lord. (See the "if" that Balaam closed his eyes to in Num.22:21,22)

Since the rebellious "smoke" of the 1960's, "responsibility truth" (the doctrine that a Christian cannot lose salvation, yet can miss the pre-trib rapture and the glories of the First Resurrection and be punished in prison temporarily during the Millennium, Rev.20:4,13,15) has all but disappeared from many conservative churches. The good "doctors" did not want your virgin ears to hear what so many wise Christians in earlier days believed about the rapture and the Millennium.

In the past, wherever there has been a revival of Bible-believing Christians aggressively studying prophecy about the Second Coming, "responsibility truth" has been at the forefront of premillennialism.

When saints believe God about His warnings they "move with fear" like Noah. (Heb.11:7) "Responsibility truth" motivates without "crushing" the saint. It gives the Christian absolute assurance of salvation since it doesn't link salvation assurance to how often one prays, studies, etc.

I am currently finishing up the last few pages of a 450- page book on the subject of the Kingdom Reward. In the last chapter I have been tracing the history of "responsibility truth" in regard to the Millennium. It is an interesting history. It left mainstream, premillennial fundamentalism in the 1960's when the world was shouting about "sex, drugs and rock music." Responsibility, accountability, fear, judgment, "outward works of holiness," "New Testament commands," etc. all became bad words. All the prophecy magazines agreed. Modern editors of magazines that had been around for decades suddenly dropped all articles and references to a partial rapture or partial reign (which before had been so prevalent throughout their periodicals) and determined that such "negative," "legalistic" ideas no longer had a place in the forum of "modern fundamentalism." ("Oh what a revival in the 1960's! Oh what a blessing America has seen since such 'negative,' 'horrible' ideas were sufficiently buried!)

Premillennialism itself even came under attack and was looked on as something silly that they argued about in the last century. (For example one may observe how Jessie Penn Lewis's Overcomer magazine went from contending for a "partial rapture" and "partial Millennial reign," to a magazine that thinks it isn't "proper" to stand vigorously for any Millennial view at all! J.P. Lewis herself predicted that this would happen as the century progressed.)

The Bible prophesied that in the last days "responsibility truth" would disappear from the mainstream of Christianity. (2Tim.3) It is a grievous mistake to take away foundational doctrines that saints so badly need to overcome the temptations of Satan in these perilous times:
<blockquote>Jude 1:Â 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not...12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear...</blockquote>

            "Catholics still dominate the U.S. Congress. There are 150, including 91 Democrats and 59 Republicans, among the 535 members of the 107th Congress...Catholics have been the largest religious bloc in the legislative branch since 1964, said Albert Menendez of Americans for Religious Liberty, a church-state separation group that conducts the survey. 'They're going to stay in first place probably forever.'.." (Religion News Service, Jan.8, 2001)

"Forty years ago a Roman Catholic i.e. 1847] a Roman Catholic priest and a judge of one of the courts were walking down the streets of Cincinnati together, when the priest said to the judge that the time would come when the Roman Catholic Church would be the ruling power in this country and be the established religion. 'But,' said the judge, 'your religion can never be the established religion.' - 'Why not?' said the priest. 'Because our laws and our institutions of government, State and National, are against it.' - The priest replied - 'We will change your laws and constitutions. The time will come when Roman Catholics will have a majority in your Legislature and your Congress, and they will make the laws to suit themselves, and make such amendments to State and National Constitutions as they please; and what shall prevent the Roman Catholic from being the established religion, when they who govern in the Church rule the State?' 'That time will never come,' said the judge, 'the genius of our popular institutions is against it.' 'The genius of the Church is in its favour, and the time may come, and must come, and shall come,' said the priest, with great determination written in his countenance, as if he could and would bring all that he desired and predicted upon the nation. It was thought at the time to be an idle boast of a bigoted priest, when he added, 'The Church shall govern.' But as an American has said in 1865, in New York, 'Look at the state of things now. How happens it that so many men who are bigoted Romanists have crept into power in all branches of our general and state governments?...Our eyes should not be shut..." (M. Baxter, "Forty Coming Wonders," 1887)

All Bible-believing, Blood-bought, grace-saved, fundamental Christians need to stand up and do some salty "letting" (i.e. KJV English for hinder!) in the power of the Spirit. There is still an open door and much opportunity to preach the whole counsel of God without opposition (at least in America). Let's use this opportunity and save and disciple as many people as we can. Give them all a great, big head-ache as they continue to implement their Jesuit plan.

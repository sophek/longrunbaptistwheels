        <h1>COMPROMISED HUSBANDS WITH VEXED SOULS</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote>"Men happier if wife stays at home: study - He'd be miserable if he had to wear that apron, research shows. - Working men with stay-at-home spouses are less likely to be depressed, says a new study, but the reverse is true for women. When the wife is home looking after the kids and building family ties in the community, life sails along much more easily for the man of the house, according to the study of British civil servants published today. It also found men whose partners take full-time work were more depressed..." (National Post, Nov 9, 2001)</blockquote>
My new booklet, "Where's Mother...?" deals with the negative effects of mothers working outside the home. It appears that "psychiatric priests" around the world are continuing to discover through their laborious research some of the things that God has placed in the conscience of every man and woman, as well as revealed in His Word. When mothers work outside the home, the family (and society in general) begins to crumble:
<blockquote>Titus 2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</blockquote>
If it is "old-fashioned" to teach that mothers should be keepers at home, is it "old-fashioned" to teach that wives should love their husbands and children? These things are all in the same context! As Lot lusted after Sodom and vexed his own soul (2 Pet.2:8), so do many men lust after the extra money a second income provides. They likewise vex their own souls by thrusting the wife out of the home, disrupting the family order God has ordained. When women excel out of the home, the men often become passive, effeminate, slothful, and often hide behind the skirts of their wives (or...on second thought...I guess that should be "the PANTS of their wives"!).

        <h1>WHY GOD MADE SILVER TO HEAL</h1>

            Proverbs 12:18 ...the tongue of the wise IS HEALTH.

Proverbs 10:20 The tongue of the just is as CHOICE SILVER...

Let us begin this article with some disclaimers: There are certainly "quacks" in the world. But we must not be gullible. Some of the biggest ducks that have ever "quacked" are the so-called "quack-watchers." They say you can't believe everything you read on the Internet. That is certainly a true statement. However, they slyly expect their readers to forget that they are also "on the Internet."

One of the best ways to discern where the true deceivers are found is to "follow the money" (1 Timothy 6:10). In other words, we should ask: If _____ is true, then who would lose money? If a great deal of money or power could be lost if a certain claim is found to be true by the masses, then you can be certain that the folks who are losing the money or power will not embrace the new discovery with hugs and kisses! They will do what they can to undermine the claims with much mockery. In a clandestine manner, they will hire, intimidate or bribe others to terrify or humiliate people away from the truth. Another way to accomplish their goal is through flattery. They say to the readers that they have ensnared:

"You are not gullible; no, not YOU! You are an EDUCATED person. You do not fall for 'junk science.' You investigate things by reading. Now close your eyes, and repeat after us: TRUTH IS NORMALITY. TRUTH IS NORMALITY. WHATEVER IS NORMAL IS TRUTH. WE ARE NORMAL. WE DECIDE WHAT IS NORMAL. THE SYSTEM IS TRUTH. The nuts are outside of the box. The educated people are in the box. Now, get up you strong soldier of conventionalism, and MOCK THOSE DELUDED REBELS! Roll your eyes! Sigh at them! Scorn them as fools. Chastise them with biting sarcasm! You are above them. Pat yourself on the back for being one of the 'discerning ones.'"

Of course, the gullible "consumer of conventionalism" will suffer greatly in the jaws of a designed-normality that is created to only enrich the merchants "in the saddle."

(Translated: Billion dollar companies cannot make much money off of a natural mineral such as silver. Therefore, nutrition and "natural" remedies are despised, rejected, and barely even mentioned in the medical schools that receive research grants and gifts from the pharmaceutical industry.)

Praise the Lord for holy physicians (Colossians 4:14). I am certainly not a medical doctor. Therefore, be sure to ask your medical doctor what he or she thinks of this article. (Then, as you leave, you might also ask the "Doc" who paid for his recent, expensive ski-trip in Canada.)

But let us continue with one last disclaimer: There are at least three ways that people can make an idol out of silver. The first way, of course, is to decorate an image with silver and then worship it (Jeremiah 10:4). The second way, is to seek, love, and serve silver (as money) more than God and His Holy Scriptures (Proverbs 16:16, Matthew 6:24). The last way silver can become an idol is when its healing properties are sought apart from God. It is idolatry to prize any gift more than the Giver; that is, it is sinful to value or seek the "means" God has graciously given to the poor for their physical healing, more than the Lord Himself (i.e. the true Healer):

2 Chronicles 16:12 ...yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died...

Before examining the healing properties of silver, let us first notice the apparent REASON why God has blessed this mineral with such powers. The reason is found in the SPIRITUAL truths that are represented by silver in the Holy Bible.

Purified silver, in the Bible, is first a picture of inspired, preserved Scripture:

Psalms 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as SILVER tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

Spiritual and eternal life are found in these Scriptures:

Luke 4:4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not LIVE by bread alone, but by EVERY WORD OF GOD.

John 5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth MY WORD, and believeth on him that sent me, hath EVERLASTING LIFE...

John 6:63 ...the WORDS that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

It is, therefore, not a strange thing that purified silver would one day be found to have anti-viral and anti-bacterial powers that can protect and heal man's body. Silver has the power to cleanse physical man of these harmful, microscopic invaders, in the same manner that Scripture cleanses man, morally:

Psalms 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man CLEANSE his way? by taking heed thereto according to THY WORD.

Secondly, since silver is a picture of pure, preserved Scripture, it is no wonder that it also pictures "the tongue of the just." The "tongue of the just" teaches, preaches, and shares Holy Scripture; it is directed by the Bible:

Proverbs 10:20 The TONGUE OF THE JUST is as CHOICE SILVER: the heart of the wicked is little worth.
21 The lips of the righteous FEED MANY: but fools DIE for want of wisdom.

Notice that verse Proverbs 10:21 reveals that the words of the righteous can bring LIFE!:

Proverbs 12:18 ...the tongue of the wise IS HEALTH.

Proverbs 15:4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of LIFE...

Again, it is no great wonder that silver (since it pictures the life-giving tongue of the just), is also found to naturally promote and preserve health in scores of ways!:

Proverbs 16:24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and HEALTH to the bones.

Just as "pleasant words" (enriched by Scripture) bring health to the bones, ironically, silver has also been found to be of great help to man's physical bones. It has been used for plates in the surgical repair of bones. Bones are often mended using cement that contains silver salts. Many even claim that silver increases the healing process of broken bones. A fascinating researcher named Robert O. Becker (i.e. Retired Prof. of Medicine at Upstate Medical Center, Syracuse, Director of Orthopedic Surgery at the Veterans Hospital, Syracuse, New York, and author of "Cross Currents" and "The Body Electric") found that low-current silver electrodes can actually stimulate bone formation (similar to the regeneration of lost parts observed in salamanders). Since silver also pictures redemption, it would not be surprising to find this claim proved true.

In the Bible, the SILVER half-shekel (Exodus 30:11-16), since it was ransom or atonement money, pictures the healing Blood of Christ:

"...this beautiful type of the HALF-SHEKEL OF SILVER, shadows forth the PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST, as the redemption price provided by God. And, when the sinner estimates its all-sufficient value in the presence of God, he answers the action of the Israelite in paying down the silver half-shekelâ€¦.The Israelite, who paid his ransom-money, was numbered as a soldier and a servant for God. A place was assigned him in the battle-field: and he had his position in the campâ€¦.In like manner, the believer is redeemed to God, by the Blood of Christ, from the world, and from slavery to sin and Satan; that he may be a soldier and a servant of the Most High; to be led, guided, and sustained by Him, who has called him out of darkness, into His marvelous light."
(Soltau, "The Tabernacle")

Since silver pictures redemption, certainly, then, it should not be shocking to find in silver these amazing, natural powers pertaining to our physical healing. It would serve as a beautiful and fitting type of the redemption and healing that is found in Jesus Christ our Saviour.

Yet, hold the horses. We are warned by Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch.com against silver:

"Of course, the fact that a product inhibits bacteria in a laboratory culture doesn't mean it is effective (or safe) in the human body."

Notice, he never denies that silver will kill harmful bacteria and viruses. Do not miss the clever wording.

When I burned my ankles in concrete, the minor-emergency clinic told me that I must go to the hospital because they didn't have any silver on hand! The emergency room gave me a silver cream. Now, why is it that they would give me something with SILVER in it, when I had such dangerous burns? Notice:

"Silver sulfadiazine cream is applied to the skin and/or burned area(s) to prevent and treat bacterial or fungus infections that may occur in burns." (Mayoclinic.com)

"Conventional abx (antibiotics) in the amounts necessary to stop the infections are so toxic that they would kill the patients if used in the same manner. The silver is absorbed by thousands of burn patients by the skin tissues, viscera, and carried by bloodstream in burn victims in vast quantity and the silver is proven to have no negative effects on the other organs of the body, as opposed to conventional abx which would kill the patient if used in the same amount. This fact has been proven via decades of usage of silver in every burn ward in every City in the USA."|
(Dr. Johnson's Healthy Living Newsletter, April 16, 2005)

It is therefore a scientific FACT that silver has great germicidal properties. Can it really be true that the only reason that millions of people are not being advised by doctors to use colloidal silver for scores of infections (with some common-sense moderation, of course), is that they are afraid that someone will turn blue? Might not one little reason be the fact that such a home-cure would be practically FREE?

I came down with strept throat every year for much of my life. Nothing would heal it but antibiotics. My first "test" with colloidal silver (home-made) was when I had a bad case of strept. Before long, God used the silver to totally heal me - without antibiotics. And the great thing is that I have never got it again!

The truth of the matter is that most informed people in the medical and scientific community KNOW that silver is a potent germicide. But any form of it that cannot be patented will usually be ignored and scorned.

An article by Jim Powell in "Science Digest" (March, 1978) presents some wonderful facts concerning silver:

"Thanks to eye-opening research, silver is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine. An antibiotic kills perhaps half-dozen different disease organisms, but silver kills some 650.

Resistant strains fail to develop. Moreover, silver is virtually non-toxic. Says a pioneering silver researcher, Dr Harry Margraf of St Louis: 'Silver is the best all around germ-fighter we have.'...even tiny amounts of silver wipe out huge quantities of disease organisms in water....To guard against such water-borne diseases as dysentery, more than half the world's airlines now use silver water filters...After testing 23 methods of purifying water, NASA selected a silver system for the space shuttle...Silver is widely used to purify swimming pool water, and it doesn't sting your eyes as chlorine does....In ancient Greece and Rome, people used silver containers to keep liquids fresh....The comeback of silver in medicine began more than a decade ago....Richard L. Davies, executive director of the Silver Institute, which monitors silver technology in 37 countries, reports: 'In four years, we've described 87 important new medical uses for silver. We're just beginning to see to what extent silver can relieve suffering and save lives.'"

Physicians during the Civil War used a form of silver to treat venereal diseases (e.g. F. J. Bumstead, M.D., "The Pathology and Treatment of Venereal Diseases," 1861)

In fact, the healing properties of silver have actually been known (at least in some degree) from ancient times:

"For thousands of years, silver has been highly regarded as a versatile healing tool. In ancient Greece, Rome, Phoenicia and Macedonia, silver was used extensively to control infections and spoilage. Hippocrates, the 'Father of Medicine,' taught that silver healed wounds and controlled disease. Around 400 B.C., he listed as a singular treatment for ulcers 'the flowers of silver alone, in the finest powder.' Herodotus describes how the King of Persia carried with him boiled water in silver flagons to prevent sickness. In 69 B.C., silver nitrate was described in the contemporary Roman pharmacopoeia. Pliny the Elder, in his survey of the world's knowledge, Natural History (78 A.D.), states in Book XXXIII, Section XXXV, that the slag of silver '... has healing properties as an ingredient in plasters, being extremely effective in causing wounds to close up...'...During the wars with Napoleon, the armies of Tsar Alexander used water casks lined with silver to clean drinking water from rivers and streams. This practice by the Imperial Russian army was common through World War I and continued to be incorporated by some units in the Soviet Army during World War II....By 1910, Henry Crookes had documented that certain metals, when in a colloidal state, had strong germicidal action, but were harmless to human beings. "
(Dr. Eric J. Rentz, D.O.; http://www.oligodynamic.com/history.html)

Based on scores of recent silver products on the market, the amazing germicidal properties of silver can no longer be honestly maintained with a straight face! The argument will now have to change to, "Oh, I never doubted that colloidal silver would heal a person of various afflictions. I just think it can also be dangerous if you don't know what you are doing." Yes, a person will appear very foolish indeed when he DOGMATICALLY tries to maintain that collodial silver will not kill infections in light of the FACT that there are several new products available utilizing the germicidal powers of silver!

For example, notice the following news reports:

"Working out on a regular basis is great for your health but a lot of people hate those smelly gym clothes. Now, some new clothes are hitting the market and their makers promise they prevent odor thanks to a secret ingredient. They call it 'Silver Wear.' It works for tennis star Anna Kournikova, some olympic athletes, NASA astronauts and now, you can try the latest workout gear on for size!....'BACTERIA ARE INHIBITED BY THE SILVER, and therefore they cannot produce the odor indigenous to sweat,' said Dr. Philip Tierno, the author of 'The Secret Life of Germs.' In fact, silver has been used for years in the medical community to prevent the growth of bacteria. 'Silver products are used to line catheters that are placed inside the human body,' said Dr. Tierno....In additon to preventing odor, the manufacturers said the silver also works as a temperature regulator - keeping you comfortable, in hot and cold conditions...." (http://www.Wcpo.com, Carol Williams)

"Polartec maker Malden Mills is fighting one of war's dirty little secrets. Things can get a little smelly under 18 pounds of body-clinging Kevlar and rock-hard armor plating.

And it's not just noses in the fox hole that are in danger of being bent out of joint. Fred Chan, program manager for Special Operation Forces' warrior protection at the Soldier Systems research laboratory in Natick, Mass., said odor is a key factor special operatives must contend with when eluding enemy patrols, dogs or other means of detection...'It can mean the difference between life and death,' Chan said. That's the primary reason U.S. Special Forces Command bought 20,000 pairs of antimicrobial underwear from Malden Mills for its active personnel. Known for its Polartec Power Dry and winter activewear lines, Malden emerged from bankruptcy last year and employs close to 1,000 people at the company's Lawrence and Methuen mill. Malden's Power Dry with X-Static fiber uses PURE SILVER THREAD from Nobel Fibre Technologies with Malden's own fast-drying sportswear. Composing 5 percent of the soldier's underwear and T-shirts, THE SILVER ACTS AS A NATURALLY OCCURRING BACTERIA AND MICROBE KILLER, according to Malden spokesman David Costello..."

The next time you are in the drugstore, you might take a look at the bandage section and see "CURAD SILVER ASSORTED BANDAGES." Here is the advertisement:

"Silver Natural Antibacterial - Silver in the Pad - Laboratory testing showed that silver in the dressing reduced bacterial growth (Staph.aureus, E. coli, E. hirae, and P. aerguinosa) for 24 hours. Curad Silver bandage is indicated for first aid to help minor cuts, scrapes, abrasions, lacerations and scalds. Curad Silver bandage is an adhesive bandage with silver added for an antibacterial effect."

In conclusion, the game is over. It is time for medical leaders to simply confess the obvious. Think of the poor people that could be saved in the world if gallons of colloidal silver were sent to disease-prone areas (as after the tsunami). Today, the immune systems of people are being weakened by the over-use of antibiotics. Many more people are killed by the terrible infections that are often found lurking around in hospitals. Aside from these problems, people are often forced to have high-costing medical insurance, or else they are charged a $150 doctor's office visit, plus the price of antibiotics, simply to accomplish what, many times, could be accomplished for FREE, at home, with just a little research and common-sense.

As we have seen, I believe God has placed these disease-fighting properties in silver because it is a picture of the healing, sin-cleansing powers found in the Blood of Christ, and the Word of God. And just as with spiritual healing, "not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called" to see the light (1 Corinthians 1:26). God has given the poor man wild garlic growing abundantly in his yard, colloidal silver, and other natural, powerful germ fighters, right under his nose. But the poor man must not be simple-minded:

Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.

Let each be persuased in his or her own mind. There are some debates concerning the most effective and/or safest forms of silver, how to make it, and other issues. Let us read and study, and proceed with moderation in such matters. The Bible teaches moderation with pure grape juice (how much more should we be moderate with colloidal silver, etc.?) We sometimes take a half-cup (or less) of colloidal silver anytime we have been around people that are sick, or in hospitals, etc. By the Lord's grace, with healthy eating and living, we have avoided sickness for years. Watch for quacks and conniving peddlars (even in the natural and alternative health-care industry, where, thankfully, so much "out of the box" wisdom and common-sense abounds). But make sure you watch the self-appointed quack-watchers, as well! The conventional normality-machine can often kill you quicker than the worst forms of quackery.

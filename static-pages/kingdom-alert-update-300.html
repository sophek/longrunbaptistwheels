GREETINGS!
********************
It is getting harder to make time for my Kingdom Alert, but I am not giving up! This is issue #300, praise God! We will be having our 5th child born in June (God willing). Perhaps I will have boy this time? It is moving quite a bit in the womb. I will certainly be thankful for another precious little girl. Please pray for a healthy delivery.


*************************************
KINGDOM REWARD CONFERENCE
*************************************
DATES: March 6th, 7th and 8th (Conference starts on Thursday morning, and ends mid-day on Saturday).

PLACE: Mansfield Texas, Kingdom Baptist Church.

On our website (http://www.kingdombaptist.org), there is detailed information concerning hotels, etc. in Mansfield. Also, we have some people that are willing to host some individuals or families, if you would like to stay with someone.

We are planning on providing some great physical food, and there will be a lot of great spiritual food! We have a great line-up of speakers. And we are still working on the exact schedule.

If you are a pastor, missionary, or evangelist, etc., and you believe in Millennial exclusion/chastisement for unfaithful Christians at the Judgment Seat, please contact me if you are interested in speaking.

We hope you will plan on attending! This will be a good time to ask questions and grow in this important subject of Kingdom prizes and warnings. We are commanded to seek the Kingdom of God FIRST in our lives (Matthew 6:33). God tells us that when we seek His wisdom more than money, etc., we will then understand the FEAR OF THE LORD (Proverbs 2:4-5)! Jesus also tells us that some will understand "the word of the Kingdom," (Matthew 13:19), yet they will lose it when they are persecuted or afflicted for the truth's sake (Mark 4:17). Others will simply have the truth choked by the cares or riches of this world (Matthew 13:22). Therefore, be encouraged in the Lord, and plan today to meet with us in March - unless the Lord comes beforehand!

HUCK-STER'S AND THE GULLIBILITY OF MODERN CHRISTIANS

Why are people so easily misled? Why do corrupt preachers and politicians have such an easy time deceiving people? How many times will Christians fall for the same lies? All a person has to do is mention "Jesus" and use a few religious phrases, and the simple-minded are ready to give him (or her) their full devotion. Of course, this has always been a problem; but things are obviously waxing progressively worse in these last days:

2 Timothy 3:13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

Saul was loved by the people on the basis of his outward appearance (1 Samuel 16:7). The Lord condemned such reckless judgment:

John 7:24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

The Apostle Paul also had to deal with the shallowness of many saints. Some despised his appearance:

2 Corinthians 10:10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

Romans 16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the SIMPLE.

Hillary Clinton (in a Democratic debate) claimed that she was glad to have a "prayer chain" (people praying for her).  I do not think her language was accidental. Men like Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are experts at this religious language. They can quote Biblical phrases in such a manner that thousands are led to believe that the Lord Jesus actually endorsed the modern Welfare State!

But many Republicans refuse to be outdone by the Bible quoting Democrats. For example, George Bush is not a greenhorn when it comes to using religious language. In one State of the Union address, he exclaimed:

"There's power, wonder-working power, in the goodness and idealism and faith of the American people."

Our holy hymn reads that there is wonder working power in the BLOOD OF THE LAMB. Therefore, Bush's exclamation was not only a well-planned, psychological manipulation (e.g. Edward Bernays), it was also blasphemous! Likely, what Bush really meant was that there is a "wonder working" freedom to do whatever one wishes as President due to the goodness and GULLIBILITY of the American people - especially many Christians. Along this line, David Kuo ("Tempting Faith"), a Bush insider (former second-in-command of the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives), stated that Christians were being used and manipulated by Republican political leaders who privately despise them:

"National Christian leaders received hugs and smiles in person and then were dismissed behind their backs and described as 'ridiculous,' 'out of control,' and just plain 'goofy."

The real "wonder" is not that leaders in American politics use religion; the incredible thing is that it actually works! No matter how many times people have had their faces rubbed in the mud, they are soon back and ready for more deception. Even God wonders about such things!:

Jeremiah 5:30 A WONDERFUL and horrible thing is committed in the land;
31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and MY PEOPLE LOVE TO HAVE IT SO: and what will ye do in the end thereof?

What then, is the answer? Christians must choose to obey the Bible! We are warned not to be gullible in judgment:

Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.

1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

The Lord Jesus Christ teaches us to judge FRUIT, not LEAVES!:

Matthew 7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

What is the difference between fruit and leaves? Fruit takes more TIME to arrive! Therefore, we must not judge anything based on appearances alone. We must not believe politicians or televangelists, simply because they have a big smile, use positive, religious language, and speak to people as if they are little children. We must judge people by their history, by their record, by what they have actually done (fruit) - NOT what they promise during election time!

For example, can you guess which politician said the following words?:

"We will fight the Atheistic Movement."

"This human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief."

"My feelings as a Christian point me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter."

"What we have to fight for. . .is the freedom and independence. . .so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the Creator."

"I fell down on my knees and thanked Heaven from an overflowing heart for granting me the good fortune of being permitted to live at this time."

"We want to fill our culture again with the Christian spirit."

These are quotes from Adolf Hitler! He was an expert at using Christian language to beguile the simple-minded. Joseph Goebbels, the infamous Nazi leader, noted in his diary in 1939 that Hitler was deeply "anti-Christian." In fact, the Nazis revived paganism, and despised Christianity as a weakness. But, like many today, they knew how to use Christian language to beguile the simple-minded sheep to gain power.

There were some men who were not fooled by Hitler. They looked beyond the emotional hype. They ignored the bewitching promises that appealed to the emotions and fears of the religious masses. They judged righteous judgment! Yet, sadly, they were mocked and despised. Hitler taught his supporters to laugh loudly, humiliate and mock all opposition.

Let us wake up as Christians and expose all frauds and liars! Many deceivers are counting on either your passivity, or your continued stupidity. Let us judge men by their true record; and let us read between the smiles, the tears, the one-liners, and the religious language and symbolism! It is time for Christians to say, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!"

EXCERPTS FROM: "THE WRATH OF GOD AND THE CHASTENING OF THE LORD," BY PHILIP MAURO

[Mauro was blessed with great insight into the errors of the Revised Version. He was fearless in standing for the whole counsel of God as he saw it - including the future, temporary chastisement of some saints at the coming of the Lord. He believed that the zealous objections of many Christians against these warnings were often motivated by their own unfaithfulness to Christ - of which they stubbornly refused to repent. In other writings, Mauro went too far in reacting to certain errors in Scofieldism. But I am thankful that he was not "ashamed" of the Lord's warnings to His disciples (Luke 9:26). The following article is Mauro's response to some objections to his commentary on the Book of Hebrews, "God's Pilgrims"]:

[Mauro]: "In view of questions that have been raised concerning certain parts of this book, namely, those which apply the warnings of Hebrews and of other New Testament Scriptures to the redeemed people of God, it has seemed desirable to append a few comments so as, if possible, to give further light upon that subject. In order that readers may understand clearly the points in question we quote below an article which recently appeared in print under the title 'No More Wrath.' It is our earnest desire that readers may compare the statements of that article with what is said in this volume, and may carefully subject both views to the test of the Scriptures. There is need of this, seeing that the matter discussed is of very great importance. The article referred to is as follows:

''Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life' (John 5: 14). 'There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus' (Rom. 8: 1). 'Who delivered us from so great a death' (2 Cor. 1: 10). 'Who delivered us from the wrath to come' (1 Thess. 1: 10). 'For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ' (1 Thess. 5: 9). 'Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son' (1 Col. 1: 13). 'And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others' (Eph. 2: 3). 'And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My Hand' (John 10: 28). And how many more texts might be given, which teach the complete deliverance from wrath and condemnation of the sinner who has believed in the Lord Jesus Christ! Our blessed and adorable Substitute on the Cross has accomplished the work of deliverance for us. The judgment due to us rolled over His Head. He drank the cup of wrath in our stead. Nothing we have done, or could do, can deliver us from wrath and condemnation. Equally true it is that the One Who hath saved us and delivered us will keep us. Wrath and condemnation can never, no, NEVER, be the lot of a child of God. The sins, the failures, and the short-comings of the believer can never affect his standing in grace. Once saved means forever saved, independent of what we are and what we do.  The apostates mentioned in Hebrews were not true believers, but Jews that had gone to a certain extent with Christianity and were going back to Judaism. The enemies of the Cross in Philippians (chapter 3.), whose end is destruction, were not true children of God, but such as had crept in unawares (Jude, verse 4). No true Christian, who knows himself a lost sinner and is saved by grace, can ever be an enemy of the Cross. To teach that salvation depends on what we do, and that our keeping for eternal life, and the receiving of glory, depends on a surrendered and separated life, or anything else, is a dangerous thing. It leads to self-occupation and introspection; it must eventually take away from the glory and sufficiency of the work and power of the our Lord. It leads simple Christians into confusion. The heart knowledge of salvation by Grace, the great love wherewith He hat loved us, the living Christ, and His love for us, produces a holy walk in the believer.'


[Mauro]: 1. We rejoice in the truth, so clearly stated in the Scriptures quoted in the foregoing article. . .[but] the writer of the foregoing article has lost sight of the chastening of the Lord, than which there is probably no subject that is more needful at this time to be pressed upon the attention of God's people. . .The motive of the chastening of the Lord is love. 'As many as I love I rebuke and chasten' (Rev. 3: 19). The statement of Heb. 12: 6 is very strong: 'For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth'. . .

2. The passages of Scripture which proclaim the believer's security from [eternal] wrath and condemnation apply to him from the moment he believes. If, therefore, those Scriptures had any reference to the Lord's chastening (which plainly they have not), it would follow that the believer would never be disciplined at all. Clearly, then, the promises of security from wrath afford no immunity from chastening.

3. The statements in the foregoing article that 'the apostates mentioned in Hebrews were not true believers,' and that 'no true Christian who knows himself a lost sinner and is saved by grace can ever be an enemy of the Cross,' are mere assertions, for which no proof is offered. On the other hand, we have given in chaps. 10 and 11, and elsewhere (in particular, pp. 95-100), ample and convincing Scriptural evidence and arguments, showing that the warnings of Hebrews against departing from the living God are written for the admonition of His redeemed people.

Great difficulty has been encountered by expositors in attempting to classify the persons specified in Heb. 6:1-6; and inasmuch as there are teachers and expositions of high repute who, like the able writer of the foregoing article, regard those persons as 'not true believers, but Jews who had gone to a certain extent with Christianity and were going back to Judaism,' it seems incumbent upon us to give fully the reasons why we cannot any longer hold to that opinion.

No doubt the particular persons to whom the Epistle was addressed in the first instance were Jews, and the situation in which they were placed had special features which do not exist in the case of Gentile Christians; and there is no doubt that the particular system into which those Jews were in danger of lapsing was Judaism, from which even Peter had difficulty in freeing himself (Gal. 2: 11, 12). But we maintain that they were CONVERTED Jews. And as one reads the several statements made in Heb. 6. which describe the spiritual state of the persons referred to, he must be impressed with the idea that such statements could not possibly be made of unpardoned and unreconciled sinners. Whoever those persons were, the writer of the Epistle classes himself among them, for the exhortation begins with the words 'let us. . .' The language of this passage would apply to such as were children (infants) in the true faith, and that such they were is distinctly asserted in the passage immediately preceding (chap. 5: 12-14). They had become dull of hearing; they had need to be taught again the first principles of the oracles of God; and having ceased to 'go on' in the ways of God, there was danger lest they should go back to the old doings from which they had been called out. We do not see how it could possibly be said that those who were on the FOUNDATION of repentance from dead works and faith toward God were unbelievers. And it is calculated to give one something of a shock to hear that men in their sins and in the corruption of the flesh were 'partakers of the Holy Ghost.' The Lord Jesus, speaking of the Holy Spirit, said 'Whom the world cannot receive' (John 14; 17); from which it follows that an unconverted person could not possibly be a partaker of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, the statements of Heb. 6. could not have been made to define a class of unbelievers. We think it will be quite clear, when viewed apart from all theological bias, that those statements were made to set before our minds the great privileges to which even the youngest believers have been brought through the grace of God, and in order that all might understand how serious a matter it is to 'fall away' from what is set before the redeemed people of God as a goal. For instance, even the 'babe' in Christ has 'TASTED the good word of God,' for he has been fed upon the milk of the Word. Beyond all doubt the whole purpose of the passage is to exhort spiritual infants to 'go on' to the full attainment of 'the promise,' and to stimulate them to do this by showing them the peril and loss they incur if they turn back there-from.

But, it will be asked, if the meaning be so clear, how is it that some of the ablest expositors of Scripture have entertained the view set forth in the above quoted article? That fact certainly calls for an explanation; and we think it can be supplied. The view referred to is that of theologians of the Calvinistic School, who hold (and we believe rightly) that a person who has received the Son of God as his Saviour, thereby becoming a child of God, can never forfeit his relationship with God, and can 'never perish.' On the other hand, the passage in Heb. 6. is the principal Scripture upon which theologians of the Arminian School rely in support of the contention that a child of God may forfeit his relationship with God, and be lost. Both parties to this theological dispute have taken it for granted that the words 'fall away,' meant to fall away from God, that is, to cease to be a Christian, or to depart wholly from the faith and be lost; and that 'impossible to renew them again unto repentance,' meant impossible to restore them again to a standing in grace, thus putting them in a position impossible of salvation, as if they had committed the unpardonable sin. But immediately it is seen that the entire passage has to do solely with the attainment of a REWARD, promised to those children of God who go on to full- growth and show diligence to the full assurance of the hope unto the end, and who thus, through persistent faith and patience, inherit the promises, the difficulty disappears. Obviously, a son and heir may forfeit part, or all, of his inheritance, without ceasing to be the son of his parents; and there may be conditions imposed as to certain portions of the estate such that, if he once violates them (as by contracting marriage contrary to his father's expressed wishes) he can never undo his act, and be 'renewed,' i.e., reinstated in the place he was, with reference to the estate, before the condition was violated. There can be no doubt (in our opinion) that such is the true significance of the passage under consideration. It is clearly a case illustrated by the provocation in the wilderness, and by Esau's sale of his birthright. There was no 'renewing unto repentance' in either case. But the Israelites did not lose their status as God's people, nor Esau his as the son of Isaac. Esau subsequently received a blessing, but not the blessing. We might refer also to Moses as a conspicuous instance of one who, though a servant who 'was faithful in all God's house,' yet because of disobedience forfeited the privilege of entering the Land of Promise, and who found in the Lord no place of repentance as to that matter, though he sought carefully. (See Deut. 3: 23-27.)

4. Referring more particularly to the expression 'crucifying to themselves the Son of God afresh,' and 'enemies of the Cross of Christ,' we call special attention to our comments on pp. 95-100, which will, we think, satisfy the unbiased reader that those expressions are applicable to Christians, and are inapplicable to any others. If further proof as to this be desired, it may be found in 1 Cor. 11., where the Lord's Supper is spoken of. No one, we suppose, will question the application of that passage to believers; yet it contains expressions every whit as strong as those in Phil. 3. and Heb. 6. and 10. There we read the solemn statement that 'Whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be GUILTY of the BODY and BLOOD of the Lord'; and further that, 'he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation (judgment) to himself.' The expression 'guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord' is, if anything, a stronger expression than 'enemies of the Cross of Christ.'

An 'enemy' is one who opposes, or acts in a hostile manner. The Cross of Christ separates the Christian from the appetites of the flesh (the 'belly') and from 'earthly things.' Hence the Christian who acts with reference to those things in a manner contrary to the intended effect of the Cross is in opposition or enmity to that Cross. Other Scriptures fully confirm this explanation. According to Rom. 8: 5-7 (a passage which unquestionably applies to believers) the mind of the flesh is ENMITY against God. Hence believers who walk after the flesh, and who mind the things of the flesh, are at enmity with God. The danger is that the mind of the flesh in us may be 'death' to us. For 'the mind of the flesh is death,' and it is written 'if ye (believers) live after the flesh ye shall die.' Again, friendship with the world is spiritual adultery and is ENMITY with God (Jas. 4: 4). Manifestly these offences, referred to in Rom. 8. and James 4., are, from their very nature, such as only a Christian can commit. Those who are of the world cannot commit adultery with the world, for they have no covenant relations with God. In like manner the Christian who shares in the enjoyment of the things from which he has been separated, in God's contemplation and purpose, by the Cross of Christ, is at enmity with that Cross. Only a Christian can commit that offence. Therefore the telling of it brought tears to the Apostle's eyes. That unbelievers should so 'walk' is inevitable. But that saints should so walk is cause for weeping. . .

5. In the article quoted above, the word 'saved' is used as if it meant pardoned, or justified; whereas in the Scriptures discussed in this book the 'salvation' spoken of is something yet future; and this (as we have shown) is almost invariably the Scriptural sense of the words 'saved' and 'salvation.' This distinction is of the very essence of the doctrine under discussion. We are well aware that justification and the receiving of eternal life do not depend upon 'what we do.' Far from it. This volume very distinctly asserts the contrary. But on the other hand, we do say, and upon the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ and His apostles, that the salvation spoken of by them as the salvation of the soul, does depend upon the believer's walk and upon the heed paid by him to his Lord's commands. This teaching does not lead to 'self-occupation and introspection,' nor does it lead 'simple Christians into confusion.' Since it is the teaching of the Lord Himself, it would be presumptuous on our part to defend or justify it; but we may properly point out that its obvious purpose is to admonish the slothful, disobedient, and worldly Christian to consider and amend his ways. Since the publication of the first edition of this book, we have had abundant and gratifying evidence that it has served to stimulate and encourage some of God's saints, and to arouse others. We do not in the least fear that it will lead any simple Christian into confusion.

On the other hand, we do greatly fear that the effect of such articles as that quoted above is to lull into false security, and to confirm in their self-pleasing ways, those saints for whose benefit chiefly the warnings of the Lord and of His apostles have been recorded. The desire for the preaching of 'smooth things' is by no means confined to the unconverted. It is not a kindness to the slothful, world-conformed Christian to tell him that all is well with his soul, and that 'the heart knowledge of salvation by grace produces a holy walk in the believer.' That statement is contradicted both by Scripture and common experience; for there are many believers who, notwithstanding their knowledge of salvation by grace, are walking after the flesh, making a god of their appetites, and minding earthly things. These are 'enemies of the Cross of Christ.'

. . .There is a man-pleasing doctrine abroad which finds ready acceptance with the unpardoned and unreconciled sinner, namely, that God is all goodness and mercy, and there is no wrath to come for the unbeliever. But there is a counterpart to this doctrine which is well pleasing to the disobedient, world-conformed Christian, namely, that God is all grace, and there is no chastening to come for the believer. Against this latter doctrine we have sought to raise a warning. Surely it will not disturb those saints who are walking in holy separation from the world, awaiting the coming again of the Son of God 'unto salvation.' That it may serve to disturb those who are not so walking is much to be desired.

6. Several correspondents have questioned the application of Matt. 24: 42-51, and Luke 12: 35-48 to the saints of this dispensation. This objection comes mainly from those who exclude the earth-life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ from the present, or Church dispensation. Without discussing the dispensational question, we would enter a strong protest against limiting the application of these words of the Lord to any special era. Another has well said, 'Dispensational knowledge should drive the application home to us with tenfold power, instead of leading us to say, 'it does not apply to us.'' The Lord, in the Scriptures cited above, was addressing His own disciples, whom He designates in this connection by the endearing term, 'little flock' (Luke 12: 32); and He was telling them what He requires of His 'servants.' What conceivable reason can there be for supposing that His requirements of His servants in this dispensation are any less rigid than in some other? If there be any difference, it should be the other way, since the greater privileges always carry with them increased responsibilities. In this very passage we read, 'For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required' (Luke 12: 48). Those servants who are charged with the custody of the Gospel of the grace of God, and with the ministry to the members of the Body of Christ, are entrusted with the greatest responsibility ever committed to human hands. It is required of stewards that they be faithful (1 Cor. 4: 2); and this was said by the Apostle Paul concerning himself, and to a Gentile Church. In another place he said, 'Woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel.' We deem it a perilous thing to dismiss the warnings that come from the Lips of the Lord Jesus, as applying only to 'the Jewish remnant.' And surely it is an extreme instance of misdirected ingenuity in the handling of the Scriptures to apply the words 'Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom,' to the saints of this dispensation, and then to apply the words that immediately follow, and which were addressed to that very same 'little flock,' to the 'Jewish remnant.' That order of ingenuity has been very much exercised in dealing with the Epistle to the Hebrews. We believe it to be a real service to the people of God to warn them against it.

. . .This following of God's Word in a direction contrary to the natural inclinations, is the distinguishing trait of those who are of faith to the saving of the soul; for thereby they are distinguished from those who 'draw back' to the resources of the world, seemingly to their immediate gain, but really to their great and irreparable loss (Heb. 10: 39). . .Finally, let us keep in view the main thing, which is, not to settle the meaning of a disputed passage of Scripture, but to secure the benefit of the doctrine of the Lord. Beyond all doubt, consequences of the most serious character depend upon our walk here below. Whether we describe those consequences by the words 'saving the soul,' or by some other words, does not affect their serious character. Whatever explanation of those disputed passages may seem right to us, we cannot afford to neglect that salvation so great, which at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him."

NEW TRANSLATION PROMOTES FORNICATION
**************************************************

"New Bible translation promotes fornication - Archbishop of Canterbury
praises version for 'extraordinary power -' A brand-new translation of the
Bible - praised by Britain's archbishop of Canterbury, that nation's
senior Christian voice - flatly contradicts traditional core Christian
beliefs on sex and morality. Titled 'Good as New,' the new Bible is
translated by former Baptist minister John Henson for the One
organization, to produce what the group calls a 'new, fresh and
adventurous' translation of the Christian scripturesâ€¦.'Instead of
condemning fornicators, adulterers and 'abusers of themselves with
mankind',' says Ruth Gledhill, the London Times religious affairs
correspondent, 'the new version of his first letter to Corinth has St.
Paul advising Christians not to go without sex for too long in case they
get 'frustrated.'' The new version, which Dr. Williams says he hopes will
spread 'in epidemic profusion through religious and irreligious alike',
turns St. Paul's strictures against fornication on their head,' adds the
Times....In keeping with the times, translator Henson deftly translates
'demon possession' as 'mental illness' and 'Son of Man,' the expression
Jesus frequently used to describe himself, as 'the Complete Person.'...."
(WND, June 24, 2004)

 COMMENTS: First, we had the NIV calling the KJV's "effeminate" in 1
Corinthians 6, "temple prostitutes." This allows for an incredible amount
of sin that would otherwise be covered under the term "effeminate" (used
historically for crossdressing). In the same verse, the NIV turns "abusers
of themselves with mankind" into "homosexual offenders." The religious
homosexuals are therefore pleased. They use this translation the most.
They respond, "We obey this verse, and keep to our own clubs and make sure
we do not OFFEND anyone by meddling in their business!" The keenest among
them reply, "Any who dares to OFFEND US by trying to convict us of sin is
guilty of being a 'homosexual offender' according to the NIV!" As we know,
rebellion is a slippery slope. The translations are getting BOLDER in
giving the people what they desire: SINFUL LIBERTY:

2 Peter 2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you...
19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.

Come out from among this great falling away:

Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall
find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

************************************************************************
SURPRISING RESULTS FROM WORLDNETDAILY POLL ON BIBLE VERSIONS
************************************************************************
In answer to the question: â€œWhat do you think about modern Bible
translations?,â€ the first three, highest ranking answers are interesting.
Here are the top answers, followed by their polling percentages:

-Strict translations from the original languages are great, but
interpretations like 'Good as New' are worthless (53.91%)

-I don't like them â€“ the 1611 King James is the only accurate English
translation. (20.7%)

-Modern translations â€“ even if they use hip language â€“ are okay as long as
they don't pervert the original meaning. (12.46%)

WorldNetDaily.com is a conservative news website. I find it very
interesting that 20% of those responding to its poll are â€œKJV Only.â€ But
we should also ask another question here. Why is the AV 1611 the ONLY
choice offered for an â€œonlyâ€ option? If it is â€œjustâ€ a translation, why
does it STILL cause controversy and debate almost 400 years later? Why do
20% of responding readers of this daily, internet news-site, even today,
think IT is the ONLY accurate translation? Why not Websterâ€™s translation?
Darbyâ€™s? The RV? The ASV? The RSV? Why not the â€œNew King James Versionâ€
that is advertised so often on WND? This was a translation produced by
conservatives. Why wasnâ€™t there a polling option that stated, â€œThe NKJV is
the only accurate English translation.â€ Isnâ€™t this interesting? What is it
about this old translation with â€œobsoleteâ€ and â€œarchaicâ€ words that so
many would actually go to prison or GIVE THEIR LIVES rather than give it
up - four hundred years after it was first translated? You may not â€œlikeâ€
this Bible. You may not understand any of this. But one day you should ask
yourself: â€œIf God DID give us a perfect translation in English (the
international language of the last days), which Bible today would more
than likely BE it? Which Bible is the ONLY ONE that has this radical
following? Which version is the one most hated by witches and
homosexuals?â€ And when you find yourself gazing at the â€œold,â€ dusty, KJV
on your bookshelf, I ask you to simply do one more thing: Based on its
fruit, and the above considerations, open this Bible and read it IN FAITH.
Read it as Godâ€™s perfect Word (in every word). I believe the Lord will
greatly reward such faith. He promised to PRESERVE His words (Proverbs
12:7,  Matthew 24:35). He will pour out His wisdom unto you in answer to
your humble faith:

Hebrews 4:2 â€¦the WORD preached did not profit them, not being mixed WITH
FAITH in them that heard it.

James 1:21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
naughtiness, and receive WITH MEEKNESS the engrafted WORD, which is able
to save your souls.
 
Mark 12:37 â€¦And the COMMON people heard him GLADLY.
38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the SCRIBESâ€¦

SPACE ELEVATOR: THE NEW TOWER OF BABEL?
**************************************************
"President Bush wants to return to the moon and put a man on Mars. But
scientist Bradley C. Edwards has an idea that's really out of this world:
an elevator that climbs 62,000 miles into space. Edwards thinks an initial
version could be operating in 15 years, a year earlier than Bush's 2020
timetable for a return to the moon. He pegs the cost at $10 billion, a
pittance compared with other space endeavors. 'It's not new physics -
nothing new has to be discovered, nothing new has to be invented from
scratch,' he says. 'If there are delays in budget or delays in whatever,
it could stretch, but 15 years is a realistic estimate for when we could
have one up.' Edwards is not just some guy with an idea. He's head of the
space elevator project at the Institute for Scientific Research in
Fairmont, W.Va. NASA already has given it more than $500,000 to study the
idea, and Congress has earmarked $2.5 million more...." (AP, June 26,
2004)
Genesis 11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis 28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending
and descending on it.

DOPING THE DUPES: BEWARE OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL PREDATORS
*******************************************************************
Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man
looketh well to his going.

The "Brave New World" is here. Talk about  new twist on the "war on
drugs"! Think about it. If they empower psychologists to DOPE the whole
nation, the drug companies will grow even richer. And then who will want
the stuff on the street? At least this appears to be their strategy - if
there even is one (there does not have to "really" be a strategy where
money is involved - just a gimmick). After heaping so much destruction on
the physical body, pharmacuetical companies are now growing hungrier and
impatient. They are now hungry for the brain and mind! But they need a
good excuse, and they need government power. Therefore, under the
subjection, slippery, non-existent phrase "mental illness," they have
found their gimmick. And they are coming after the children. See, you are
"mentally ill" and you do not even know it. But don't worry. They have
just the "dope" for the dupes who will believe them! It is fashionable.
And with government power, you HAVE to buy their dope, whether you want it
or not. All sorcerers and witch doctors use and push dope (though it is
probably better for you in the jungle, in its herbal state!). The Bible
teaches that SORCERY (you know, PHARMAKEIA, like PHARMACY; like
PHARMACUETICAL COMPANIES!) will engulf the world:

Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
SORCERIES, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

Notice a recent (June 21, 2004) WorldNetDaily report:

"LIFE WITH BIG BROTHER - Bush to screen population for mental illness -
Sweeping initiative links diagnoses to treatment with specific drugs -
President Bush plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health
initiative that recommends screening for every citizen and promotes the
use of expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs favored by
supporters of the administration....Critics say the plan protects the
profits of drug companies at the expense of the public. The initiative
began with Bush's launch in April 2002 of the New Freedom Commission on
Mental Health, which conducted a 'comprehensive study of the United States
mental health service delivery system.' The panel found that 'despite
their prevalence, mental disorders often go undiagnosed' and recommended
comprehensive mental health screening for 'consumers of all ages,'
including preschool children....Schools, the panel concluded, are in a
'key position' to screen the 52 million students and 6 million adults who
work at the schools. The commission recommended that the screening be
linked with 'treatment and supports,' including 'state-of-the-art
treatments' using 'specific medications for specific conditions.'...."
(Read the whole story here:

All of this is grounded upon an erroneous assumption. It is founded upon
the falsehood of PSYCHOLOGY, which began and grew out from a
MATERIALISTIC, ATHEISTIC worldview. It denied that man is also a SPIRITUAL
being. Having denied the FACT that man's MIND is non-material, it treated
every "problem" as a PHYSICAL malady. However, many of the more famous
physicists themselves abandoned MATERIALISM years ago! (See the proof at:
http://www.kingdombaptist.org/article627.cfm). If the mind is material,
then what is it that looks at an experiment and says, "This scientific
experiment PROVES such and such..." What is this thing called "proof" that
the mind can see? What is "true" and "false"? What NATURAL, MATERIAL thing
are we appealing to when we say, "'Two plus one equals four,' is a false
assertion"? Thus, the WHOLE foundation of materialistic science, which has
for so long prided itself for being NON-SPIRITUAL, is sitting upon
realities (e.g. truth, falsehood, proof) that it has never once TOUCHED or
HANDLED or SEEN with the naked eye! Yet, if it tries to deny the existence
of PROOF or truth, then there can be no scientific method at all. It cuts
off its own branch and falls to the ground.

The mind of man can recognize inmaterial things such as proof, for the
very reason that the mind of man is non-material, and God has endowed
man's mind with reason. The "machine" (the brain) is being run by a
spirit. And to teach that this spirit can be "healed" by drugs is very
dangerous. Some drugs, at times (though not nearly as often as people are
being CONNED into believing) can help the physical body. But to begin
prescribing them for MENTAL (i.e. SPIRITUAL) problems, brings us into the
realm of SORCERY. It is a realm where so-called experts are ROLLING DICE
for money. They simply do not know what consequences will be reaped upon
the physical or spiritual man by such drugs. The insane suicides and
murders by people on such drugs, so often in the media, already shows us
that we are dealing with a VERY DANGEROUS realm. Why weren't their school
shootings in former years, when practically EVERY student owned a gun?
Forget the lies that you have been fed by liberal atheists in the schools.
They first try to erase (disarm) the mind by teaching students there is no
TRUTH. Then they daily indoctrinate them into believing the things THEY
think are true (they only use the "there is no truth" lie when they are
backed into a corner or confronted).

A good place to start (other than the BIBLE, of course), to understand the
faulty foundation most of modern psychology is built upon (and therefore
the modern criminal justice system, schools, etc.), would be, "The Myth of
Mental Illness" by Thomas Stephen Szasz. You can find more of his books at
this link: (
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060911514/103-4573428-1041461 ) He
is an insider writing from a non-Christian perspective.
The Bobgans have some excellent resources explaining how the erroneous
conclusions of psychology have entered into our churches (see Col.2:8).
You may find their material here:
http://www.psychoheresy-aware.org/mainpage.html

I would strongly advise every God-fearing Christian to get your children
out of the public schools. Unless there is a reveival, they will continue
to dope up an ever-increasing number of them - without your approval.
There is going to be a fight regardless. But with your children out of the
government schools, your children can have a headstart resisting
humanistic indoctrination, and they will not so easily fall prey to these
PHARMACUETICAL PREDATORS who are trying to ride the back of the government
for filthy lucre.

SODOMITE REVELERS WANT TO OUTLAW ALL DISAGREEMENT WITH THEIR SIN
***************************************************************************

"Revelers Parade for Gay Pride Worldwide - BERLIN - Hundreds of thousands
of revelers wearing everything from full Victorian garb and designer gowns
to skimpy leather and construction hats celebrated gay pride in cities
around the world Saturday. Berlin saw one of Europe's largest parades. To
the sound of thumping techno music, the city's openly gay Mayor Klaus
Wowereit led floats in the 12th annual celebration of Christopher Street
Day, commemorating the start of the gay rights movement in New York's
Greenwich Village in 1969. Police estimated that about 200,000 people
snaked their way from the chic Kurfuerstendamm boulevard to the landmark
Victory Column, while organizers said the crowd swelled beyond
500,000...Parents led the way in Mexico City as thousands marched to
celebrate gay pride and promote tolerance....Conservative President
Jacques Chirac has asked for dialogue on the subject, and a bill
condemning discriminatory words of a sexist or homophobic nature has been
proposed. But many of the 90 groups backing Saturday's march consider it
insufficient. Under the slogan 'Enough Hypocrisy, Equality Now,' thousands
marched with 60 floats from a Left Bank square to the Bastille and across
the Seine River, led by Paris' openly gay Mayor Bertrand Delanoe...."

Comments: First, notice that the AP uses the "archiac" word "revelers."
This word has been deleted from modern translations. But it is obviously
still a good, TIMELY word for this day and hour:
 Galatians 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, REVELLINGS, and such like:
of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that
they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Secondly, notice that TOLERATION is defined by these homosexuals to mean,
"You cannot voice any opposition or disagreement concerning my lifetsyle."
That is TOLERATION. It is the OPPOSITE of toleration. It is saying, "I
will not tolerate anyone who disagrees with me. I am too sensitive." But
their effeminate sin makes them emotional this way. The amazing thing is
that the GOVERNMENTS of the world are caving into these absurd demands in
the name of "love" and "understanding." True love would seek to warn these
people:

Proverbs 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
enemy are deceitful.

************************************************************
FATHERS: THE GLORY OF CHILDREN! (Sermon, by Joey Faust)
************************************************************

TEXT: Luke 18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would
touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to
come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

We come unto Jesus in salvation and in discipleship. I would like to speak
today about the role, the influence, that fathers have in bringing their
children to Jesus. Let me show you an important verse of Scripture:

Proverbs 17:6 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory
of children are their fathers.

We are living in a day and age when the Devil and the world have joined
together like never before to hide the glory of children! The father is
the glory of children. He is not to be hidden in the background. The Devil
says to fathers, "Hide your light under a bushel!" "Be passive!" In other
words, "Forbid the children" to come to Jesus by not praying with and for
them, by not teaching them, by not disciplining them, by not knowing them,
by being a poor example, by viewing yourself as unnecessary in their
lives. But fathers are the GLORY of their children. They have an
incredible amount of influence. They should shine! The world and the Devil
and the flesh want fathers to be dark, to have their lamps put out, to
take a backseat, to be a slacker and a watcher, only a shoulder-shrugger.

We need to listen to the Bible. The father is the LIGHT of the family! He
is the receptacle that is to shine the light of Jesus in his home. When
the light goes out, and the glory fades, the children are provoked toward
rebellion:

Ephesians 6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but
bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

This certainly can refer to individual actions where children are
insulted, abused and ridiculed. But then main meaning is a general
lifestyle. It is contrasted with a general lifestyle of bringing the
children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Therefore,
"provoking the children to wrath" refers to a father that is influencing
his home towards rebellion or wrath! It refers to a life lived in
fellowship with the Devil:

Ephesians 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts
of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and
were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

A father therefore provokes his children to wrath in a general sense, by
hiding the light of God, by being passive, by not being involved, by being
embarrassed about God in the face of the children; or as our text says, by
walking according to the course of this world! A father who does this, is
provoking or influencing his children to wrath. When a father lives for
pleasure, and the lusts of this natural world, he is provoking his
children to wrath. He is their glory. They will follow him. They will
learn from him. They will seek to be like him, even if they rebel against
him.

But the father, whose glory is shame and darkness, is contrasted to the
father who brings up his children in the discipline and training of the
Lord! He let's the spiritual light of Jesus shine in his own life, and by
doing so, he brings light to the whole house. Jesus is not something for a
Sunday every now and then. The good man's life revolves around Jesus, and
therefore he brings up children who love and live for Jesus.

Now if the Bible says that fathers are the GLORY of their children, what
do you think the Devil's children in the world are going to try to do?
Back in 1999, the APA (right after they tried to sugarcoat pedophilia),
attempted to support lesbians by decrying the role of fathers in the home.
This first article helped launch a flood of material from feminists and
homosexuals against the view that the traditional father and mother
scenario is BEST for children:

"(CNS) - An article in a leading psychology journal reports that the
presence of fathers in families raising children is 'not essential,' and
that fathers 'may be detrimental to the child and the mother.' The report
in the current issue of The American Psychologist, a journal of the
American Psychological Association (APA) - recently in hot water over an
earlier report that concluded that child sexual abuse did not cause
pervasive harm - takes aim at the notion that fathers and two-parent
heterosexual marriages are necessary for the psychological health of
children. '[W]e do not believe that the data support the conclusion that
fathers are essential to child well-being and that heterosexual marriage
is the social context in which responsible fathering is most likely to
occur,' wrote Drs. Louise B. Silverstein and Carl F. Auerbach, both from
Yeshiva University, in an article called 'Deconstructing the Essential
Father.' The report appears in the June 1999 issue of the journal. In
fact, having a father present in a family situation may be detrimental to
the child and the mother, said the authors....The authors 'deconstruct'
several notions about fatherhood and marriage that they label as
'neoconservative,' including the importance of male role models on boys,
the civilizing effects of marriage on men, and unique paternal
contributions to childrearing....The idea that a male role model is
important in raising boys is also contested in the report..."
(www.freerepublic.com/forum/a378b742e150b.htm)

These people are preparing the world for a curse. When fathers hide their
light and ignore their responsibilities, God's wrath is soon to be poured
out:

Malachi 4:6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the
earth with a curse.

Let's go back to the 17th century, and see the crucial role of fathers
presented with clarity:

"As touching the spiritual state of his family; he should be very diligent
and circumspect, doing his utmost endeavor both to increase faith where it
is begun, and to begin it where it is not. For this reason, he should
diligently and frequently lay before his household such things of God, out
of his word, as are suitable for each particular. And let no man question
his rule in the word of God for such a practice....This is one of the
things for which God so highly commended his servant Abraham, and that
with which his heart was so much affected by. I know Abraham, says God, 'I
know him' to be a good man indeed, for 'he will command his children, and
his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord' (Gen.
18:19). This was a thing also which good Joshua designed should be his
practice as long as he had a breathing time in this world. 'As for me,'
says he, I 'and my household, we will serve the Lord' (Josh. 24:15).
Further, we find also in the New Testament, that they are looked upon as
Christians of an inferior rank that have not a due regard to this duty;
yes, so inferior as not fit to be chosen to any office in the church of
God. A [bishop or] pastor must be one that rules well his own house,
having his children in subjection with all gravity; For if a man know not
how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?
'The deacon' also, says he, must 'be the husband of one wife, ruling their
children, and their own house well' (1 Tim. 3). Notice, the apostle seems
to lay down this much, that a man that governs his family well, has one
qualification belonging to a pastor or deacon in the house of God, for he
that knows not how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the
church of God? This, considered, gives us light into the work of the
master of a family, touching the governing of his house.
1. A pastor must be sound and uncorrupt in his doctrine; and indeed so
must the master of a family (Titus 1:9; Eph. 6:4).
2. A pastor should be apt to teach, to reprove, and to exhort; and so
should the master of a family (1 Tim. 3:2; Deut. 6:7).
3. A pastor must himself be exemplary in faith and holiness; and so also
should the master of a family (1 Tim. 3:2-4; 4:12). 'I,' says David, 'will
behave myself in a perfect way; I will walk in,' or before, 'my house with
a perfect heart' (Psa. 101:2)....

Do not allow any ungodly, profane, or heretical books, or discourse in
your house. 'Evil communications corrupt good manners' (1 Cor. 15:33). I
mean such profane or heretical books, etc., as either tend to provoke to
looseness of life, or such as do oppose the fundamentals of the gospel. I
know that Christians must be allowed their liberty as to things
indifferent; but for those things that strike either at faith or holiness,
they should be abandoned by all Christians, and especially by the pastors
of churches, and masters of families; which practice was shown by Jacob's
commanding his house, and all that were with him, to put away the strange
gods from among them, and to change their garments (Gen. 35:2). All those
in the Acts set a good example for this, who took their curious books and
burned them before all men, though they were worth fifty thousand pieces
of silver (Acts 19:18, 19). The neglect of this fourth particular has
occasioned ruin in many families, both among children and servants. It is
easier for vain talkers, and their deceivable works, to subvert whole
households, than many are aware of (Titus 1:10, 11)."
(John Bunyan, "Bunyan's Works")

One of the most important things a father can do is to pray before his
family, and to pray for his family, in the presence of his family. A
father who has a relationship and fellowship with the unseen God will
shine the light of God to children like nothing else. But the passive, "I
am embarrassed to pray," " I am ashamed to pray," slacker fathers, who
think that they are doing their duty if they can simply buy their kids
something, should be sorry when they raise children like themselves. The
following words of Moody should stir us to pray with our children, and
know our children:

"David cried over his son: 'Oh, my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom,
would God I had died for thee.' [2 Samuel 18:33]....Dear friend, are they
all in? Put the question to yourself now. Is John in? Is James in? Or is
he immersed in business and pleasure? Is he living a double and dishonest
life?....Where is your son, your daughter? Is it well with your children?
Can you say it is? After being superintendent of a Sunday school in
Chicago for a number of years, a school of over a thousand members -
children that came from godless homes, having mothers and fathers working
against me, taking children off on excursions on Sunday and doing all they
could to break up the work I was trying to do - I used to think that if I
should ever stand before an audience I would speak to no one but parents;
that would be my chief business....Give me the sheep, and then I will have
someone to nurse the lamb....What we want is godly homes....Bring them in.
'Suffer the little children to come unto me.' Is there a prayerless father
reading this? May God let the arrow go down into your soul! Make up your
mind that, God helping you, you will get the children in. God's order is
to the father first....Now is the time to do it while you have them under
your roof. Exert your parental influence over them. I never speak to
parents but I think of two fathers, one whom lived on the banks of the
Mississippi, the other in New York. The first one devoted all his time to
amassing wealth. He had a son to whom he was much attached, and one day
the boy was brought home badly injured. The father was informed that the
boy could live but a short time, and he broke the news to his son as
gently as possible. 'You say I cannot live, Father? Oh, then pray for my
soul,' said the boy. In all those years that father had never said a
prayer for that boy, and he told him he couldn't. Shortly after, the boy
died. That father has said since that he would give all that he possessed
if he could call that boy back only to offer one short prayer for him.
The other father had a boy who had been sick for some time, and he came
home one day and found his wife weeping. She said, 'I cannot help but
believe that this is going to prove fatal.'....The father went to the
sickroom, and he saw that death was feeling for the cords of life, and he
said: 'My son, do you know you are not going to live?'....And the little
fellow smiled and said: 'Well, Father, I shall be with Jesus...'....And
the father broke down and wept. The little fellow saw the tears and said,
'Don't weep for me. I will go to Jesus and tell Him that ever since I can
remember you have prayed for me.' I have three children, and if God should
take them from me, I would rather have them take such a message home to
Him than to have the wealth of the whole world."
(D. L. Moody, 1896)

-THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE RISE OF BABYLON

-A SAMPLE OF COMMENTATORS WHO HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE REVIVALS OF BOTH
CATHOLIC ROME (REVELATION 17) AND LITERAL BABYLON (REVELATION 18)

================================================================

THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE RISE OF BABYLON

It is possible (even before the rapture) that the Babylonian kingdom (with
the city rebuilt), will arise again on the scene, and will become as
common-place in the news as Israel now is. But, as with Israel today, long
forgotten will be the controversy, and the words of multitudes of
commentators, who scoffed at literal interpretation and said that Babylon
would never rise again! Such is the spirit of the modern Alexandrians.
Because man's own hands are being used to set the stage for the future
fulfillment of the prophecies, it often appears that nothing significant
in God's providence is occurring. But this is a great error. As preterism
gains ground today (incredibly, right in the midst of so many
stage-setting signs!), we will continue to remind the scoffers of what the
Bible literally predicts, and what wise, literal commentators have long
interpreted from the Scriptures. And, in the face of these signs (e.g.
Israel restored in unbelief, implantable computer chips, weather
disasters, earthquakes, pestilences, the revival of Babylon, etc.), we
will also remind modern scoffers of what their interpretive forefathers
have so boldly, throughout history, proclaimed would never occur!

Among interpreters of the literal school, many have found a way to
harmonize the prophecies concerning Babylon and Rome. By seeing TWO
Babylons in the Book of Revelation (one mystical, and the other literal),
none of the Scriptures concerning either city, need be ignored. Too often,
literal commentators have fallen to one side or the other. Quotes could be
almost endlessly multiplied from Christians who predicted EITHER the
future revival of literal Rome, or the future revival of literal Babylon
in the Book of Revelation. However, the most skilled interpreters saw room
for both.

Others, simply take the soft, "politically correct" route, and call
Revelation 17 "religious Babylon" and Revelation 18 "commercial Babylon,"
without referring either one to a LITERAL city. With the spirit of modern
ecumenism and compromise abounding, these generic interpretations are
becoming increasingly popular. The Bible teaches both a revival of literal
Rome (with the Catholic Church ruling over politics and the nations), AND
the restoration of literal Babylon as a commercial city (the capital of
the final, new world order of Antichrist). With the stage setting around
us for BOTH of these fulfillments in the near future, the following
excerpts should be helpful to the watching Christian.

A SAMPLE OF COMMENTATORS WHO HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE REVIVALS OF BOTH
CATHOLIC ROME (REVELATION 17) AND LITERAL BABYLON (REVELATION 18)

"Controversy has arisen between the students of prophecy on the subject of
the Babylon of the Apocalypse...One party would find it in
Rome...Others...see the literal Babylon in the description given. They are
persuaded she will arise from her ruins, and be the great mart of commerce
which John depicts. They point to the prophecies against her yet
unfulfilled. She was not 'suddenly' overthrown, as foretold....No son of
man was to dwell there...Now why should these views clash? Both have a
basis of truth. There is room, aye, necessity for both. There are TWO
DESTRUCTIONS OF BABYLON: one, of Babylon mystic...and one of Babylon
literal, which is to survive Babylon mystic, and to be destroyed after
her...Both Babylons are in the way of God's kingdom, and are therefore
overturned by Him, ere His kingdom comes...The reconciling link between
the two conflicting views is found in the vision of the Ephah.
Zech.5:5-11. That appears to describe the remnant of Rome as flying from
Europe to Babylon, welcomed and flourishing there..."
(Robert Govett on Revelation, Vol. II, 1861)

"Without a doubt, therefore, the Woman is Rome; and she must also be Papal
and not Pagan Rome...Yet, strange to say, nearly all interpreters of the
two chapters have failed to notice the distinction. And so they have
either recognized the outlines of Rome in the seventeenth chapter, and
then assumed, in spite of difficulties, that she is likewise to be found
in the eighteenth; or else, being aware that the literal Babylon on the
Euphrates has yet a grand part to play in the closing scenes of the age,
and perceiving that all that is written in the eighteenth chapter would be
applicable to her were she restored, they have endeavoured to adapt the
previous chapter also to her circumstances. But, whichever of these views
be taken, the result is equally unsatisfactory: neither of them can supply
an adequate interpretation of both chapters...Both by Isaiah and Jeremiah
the fall of Babylon is immediately connected with the final restoration of
Israel....May not the vanished city [Babylon] also re-appear?...We
conclude, then, that the case of Babylon will be similar to [that] of
Jerusalem...and that she will re-appear in time to do and to suffer all
that God has foretold...It seems, therefore, on every account likely that
we may presently hear of projects to restore Babylon..." (G. H. Pember,
"The Antichrist, Babylon, and the Coming Kingdom," 1888)

"Mystery Babylon, as represented by the Roman Catholic Church, will not
last forever...The 18th chapter of Revelation speaks very plainly of a
terrible calamity and judgment which is to fall on a city called
Babylon...Can this description then apply to the mystery Babylon of the
17th chapter? We can definitely say No to this...In the year 500 A.D., or
1,100 years after Cyrus, the celebrated Jewish Babylonian Talmud was
issued, showing that it was still a seat of learning...It is, however,
admissible that the predictions have been partially fulfilled, but the
greater and more important portions, including the total destruction of
the land and the sudden destruction of the city, being evidently still
future, fortify us in the belief, from prophetic allusion, that this great
city must once more be rebuilt." (H. W. Fry, "God's Plan in the Bible,"
late 1800's)

"This woman, therefore, is a church whose official and distinguishing
color is scarlet.....This woman is a church which practices, and has
taught the people of the earth to practice, idolatry, to engage in the
worship of images. This scarlet-clad woman is drunken with the blood of
the martyrs of Jesus....This woman not only represents a church, but the
city in which it dwells and is capitalized, the center and manifestation
of its glory....There was but one city in John's day which reigned over
the kings of the earth [Rev.17:18], and that city was ROME. That the city
was Rome is corroborated topographically. We are told that the woman is
seated on seven mountains....A church in the city of Rome is a ROMAN
church; a catholic church in Rome is, therefore, a ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
And here you have the riddle read, the symbol told, the identity
disclosed. The woman foreseen and described by the Spirit of God in John
is, THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH....In Revelation, 11:18, Jerusalem is called
SODOM and EGYPT, so called to mark its moral and spiritual degeneration.
This woman and city likewise go by the name of Babylon to set forth the
turpitude, the uncleanness and the abomination, both of the city and the
system. The Roman Catholic Church is called Babylon from God's point of
view....It is idolatry - pure and simple.....As the woman who sits upon
the beast has been not only symbolically, but topographically identified
as Rome, the fact that the very beast upon which she sits is civil and
governmental Rome, becomes the repeated and doubly corroborative
demonstration that the city and system of which the woman is a symbol - is
Rome....the scarlet-clad, Babylonian woman is seen seated on the back of
this revived Roman empire. It is the prophecy that the Roman Catholic
Church will again be carried and supported by nations of the Roman earth,
and will once more RULE AND REIGN WITH TEMPORAL POWER. It is the divine
forecast of the revival of Romanism. THIS REVIVAL HAS ALREADY
BEGUN....Nothing is more impressive than the recovery of Romanism from
what seemed to be its death-blow. It reads on the page of history like a
veritable resurrection of the dead....The progress in Protestant England
is astounding....In this country [America] Romanism is advancing with
giant strides....While the population of the United States has increased
twenty-five times, the Roman Catholic population, in a little over a
century, has increased 320 times, nearly twelve times as fast....In this
country Romanism has conquered social distinction and an accepted
standing....There was a time when for an American to be a Catholic, was
sufficient to ostracize him from family and friends as though he were a
religious and social leper. To-day, the Catholic finds all doors
open....Rome is wise enough to seize the strategic moment and, at the same
time, take advantage of the differing opinions, the confusion, the
infidelity among Protestants, to draw attention to the favorite thesis of
the church, that the Bible can be read and understood only when under the
strict surveillance and inspired interpretation of the church...Not only
is the Catholic church taking the place as defender of Holy Scripture and
seeking to rescue it from profane hands, it is rapidly rising as the
BULWARK OF THE FAMILY, THE CHAMPION OF THE HOME....The Protestant Church
takes no such stand....Nor is this advance confined alone to religious
lines. Nay, the march is far away beyond that! The Roman Catholic Church
in this country is an immense political organization, holds the balance of
voting power....To-day, Romanism is politically, as well as religiously,
entrenched in the great cities of our land and, from its university center
at Washington, exercises its mysterious and far-reaching power. Romanists
confidently expect the time to arrive when the whole land will be under
its political control; when the machinery of office and legislation will
be in the power of the church and when, with her astounding increase of
numbers, she will be the religious and political dictator of the new
world....Rome may be turned back for a moment, for a season be deflected
from her course, but her course is onward....Protestantism seeks favor of
the unbelieving world, apologizes for her creeds, and would establish
herself by denying them. Romanism hurls anathema at the unbeliever,
magnifies her office, and claims to be wholly divine....Protestantism, in
its reaction from ritualism, has turned the church into a lecture room and
destroyed the feeling of reverence....As the present age goes on,
multitudes will turn away from the interrogation points of Protestantism,
to the unqualified assertion and assurance of Romanism, to her gorgeous
ritual, her spectacular worship, the glamour of her two thousand years of
unbroken history....It is this appeal to the latent superstition in man,
this splendid and uncompromising assertion, this unfaltering claim of
authority, this unity of faith...that will give the Catholic Church her
under-hold in the final religious and political struggle for the age.
Everything is making for that hour when Rome, once more seated on the back
of human government, will rule the earth. This revival of Rome in our day
is a sign of the times....The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let
us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
of light...." (I. M. Haldeman, "The Scarlet Woman, Or the Revival of
Romanism," 1910)

"The fact that the ephah is uplifted and then established by them as a
universal standard of measure sets forth the idea of a system of universal
and authoritatively established commerce. If we turn our eyes abroad upon
the world we shall find that the one great object before the nations of
the earth to-day is this image of commerce, drawing them with all the
seductive influence a siren woman might exercise upon the heart of man.
The one great aim on each part is to win the favor of this might
mistress....Steadily the world is moving forward along the plane of this
unity - unity of measure, unity of speech and unity of commerce. When
Zechariah sees the women with the stork wings bearing away the ephah, he
asks the angel with whom he had been talking whither they are bearing it.
The angel tells him they are taking it to the land of Shinar, to
Babylonia, to the spot where old Babylon lies in ruins....As Babylon was
then, and is now, overthrown and in ruins, it is logical and unqualified
testimony that Babylon must be rebuilt - that Babylon has yet a
future....the truth is, Babylon has never been made an entire desolation.
The word of the prophet has not yet been completely fulfilled. It was not
fulfilled in the Apostle Peter's day....The Book of Revelation presents us
with the picture of two distinct, future Babylons - the Mystic and
Commercial Babylon. The Mystic Babylon is described in the seventeenth
chapter....The word Babylon in this chapter is used for, and signifies,
ROME....This is mystic Babylon, casting its shadow religiously over the
earth to-day in the increased power of Romanism and the steady down-grade
of Protestantism; the shadowy forecast of the hybrid combination that is
yet to dominate the earth for a space. In the eighteenth chapter we have
neither symbolic Babylon nor actual Rome, but the real and actual city of
Babylon....The eighteenth chapter gives us the Babylon which Zechariah
sees as the base or center of the world's final commerce, the city whose
destruction and perpetual desolation both Jeremiah and Isaiah
foretold....It will be a city of untold riches, of astounding extent of
capital....It will be a city given over to pleasure as well as to
business....It will be a city of music....Babylon, it is said, shall
become the habitation of devils...'Watch ye therefore; for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the
cockcrowing, or in the morning; Lest coming suddenly, he find you
sleeping. And what I say unto you [disciples of that hour], I say unto all
[the church of that hour], WATCH.'"
(I. M. Haldeman, "The Kingdom of Commerce, and the Restoration of
Babylon," 1910)

"From this foreview of the Papacy we see that the Papal Church is not a
dying 'System.' That she is to be revived and become a 'Universal Church,'
and in so doing commit fornication with the kings of the earth, and that
she will again be 'drunk with the blood' of the martyrs of the Tribulation
Period. The meaning of chapter seventeen of the Book of Revelation is no
longer a Mystery; the prophetic portrait of the Woman there given
corresponds too closely with the history of the Papal Church to be a mere
coincidence....[But] if 'Mystical Babylon' was destroyed in the previous
chapter [17] then she cannot appear in this chapter [18], and the 'City'
here described must be a literal city called Babylon...it must refer to
some future city of Babylon. That the two chapters refer to different
things is further verified by the fact that they are announced by
different angels...the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah cannot be
fulfilled unless there is to be a future Babylon that shall be thus
destroyed....As we have seen the 'Ephah' stands for COMMERCE....This
vision of the 'Ephah' by the Prophet Zechariah is still further
confirmatory proof that the ancient City of Babylon is to be rebuilt and
become the commercial centre of the world." (Clarence Larkin, "The Book of
Revelation," 1919)

"Rome was known everywhere as the City of the Seven Hills. In 'The Two
Babylons' (p.2) Hislop cites in support of this Virgil, Propertius,
Horace, Martial, and Symmachus....The Roman Catholic system is NOT the
church of God, is NOT Christianity. This is abundantly clear from the fact
that the Harlot is positively intoxicated, has lost her senses, by
drinking the blood of the 'saints...'....Of course, a married woman may
lapse into adultery and fall thence into a deeper degradation of harlotry.
This was the case of Israel as pictured in Jr.2. and Ek 16. But this Woman
is a harlot only....Where will be the LAST centre of the Beast and the
Woman? In treating of the next chapter of Revelation we hope to show that
it points to the ACTUAL CITY Babylon in Mesopotamia, and that this will be
the capital of Antichrist, the world-centre of the last
world-empire....[Zechariah] sees two women come on the scene, having the
wind in their wings, the latter being those of a stork. These women take
up the ephah, with the first Woman therein, and carry her to Shinar....So
far is this prediction concerning Babylon [Jer.51:62] from having been
fulfilled that it can be shown from history that the site has never been
uninhabited, even as it never yet has endured a sudden destruction. No
such calamity overtook it at the capture by Cyrus. It suffered no injury,
but he rather beautified it and made it his capital. See Budge,
'Babylonian Life and History, ed. 2, 55-57, quoting the cylinder of Cyrus,
Br. Mus. No. 12,049; and Herodotus, Book III, 159, who states distinctly
that when Cyrus took the city he neither destroyed the wall nor tore down
the gates...Therefore the prediction of complete and everlasting solitude
still awaits fulfillment..." (G. H. Lang, "The Revelation of Jesus
Christ," 1945)

"No other city than Rome is located on the seven hills or the seven
mountains; no other city of the world has dominated the Gentile people as
has the city of Rome...as we move into the end of time, religious Babylon
gains the ascendancy, dominating and controlling the political powers and
nations of the world. But there comes that moment when the political
powers will hate this religious power to such an extent that they will
revolt against that religious power and utterly destroy it. We have seen
that in miniature in the case of Russia...Now the Babylon which we will
study in chapter 18 is not mystery. It's just Babylon, which means literal
Babylon....Babylon in 17 is the great religious power claiming and getting
the wealth of the world for her own personal use, whereas the Babylon in
chap.18 bestows her wealth and power upon the kings...In 1898 there were
over 10,000 people living in the city of Babylon. The Arabian still
pitched his tent there..." (A. Edwin Wilson, 1901-1986; transcribed from
Radio Tapes, No.7, Rev.17:6-19:8)

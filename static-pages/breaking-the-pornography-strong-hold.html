        <h1>BREAKING THE PORNOGRAPHY STRONGHOLD</h1>
        <div id="content">
            2 Corinthians 8:21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but ALSO IN THE SIGHT OF MEN.

Webster defines the word "honest" in the above verse as "decent." In the past decade, "indecent" satellite TV, cable TV, videos, and the Internet have brought lust and many forms of the horrible sin of fornication right into the homes of multitudes of professing Christian families:

"Danville, Calif...Most churches are uncomfortable admitting that the faithful could be hooked on porn, and confession is especially shameful for church members torn between their behavior and biblical virtues....anecdotal reports suggest that growing numbers of church members and pastors are being ensnared by addiction to pornography, in large part because they can easily access it anonymously on their computers....Examples: Promise Keepers, the evangelical men's movement, reports that one out of three men who attended its revival-like rallies in 1996 admitted that they 'struggle' with pornography. Focus on the Family, founded by Christian psychologist James Dobson, reports that one out of seven pastors who call its toll-free help line say they are addicted to pornography...." (Los Angeles Times, March 20, 2001)

"Most homes now have computers with monitors that are more realistic than the TV. Children can operate them better than the adults; and over 20% of everything on the web is pornography or worse. Half of the Christian families in America now have the XXX store right in their homes. Families lie down at night and sleep just a few feet from the black door of Sodom....There was a time that if a man was 10 minutes late getting home from work an explanation was expected; today men retreat to rooms with closed doors and take trips to Bangkok, Thailand or the skin joints of New Orleans. Fifteen years ago less than 1% of men used pornography. Today, according to recent polls by Christian ministries, more than half of the professing Christians 'use pornography' regularly. Preachers who would have been too proud to have ever gone to a porn shop, can now go to the worst joints in the world, knowing they are absolutely secure against accusing eyes....There is an epidemic. The churches are either dead or alive with lust....This sin is so pervasive in our society that if all the child molesters were arrested on Friday night, there wouldn't be enough people [to] show up for work on Monday to operate the country. Prisons that now have 1,000 inmates would have 100,000...." ("The Challenge," By Michael Pearl, May - June 2002)

Let me state some reasons why I believe we are in this mess. First, let's deal with some foundational, doctrinal issues. Those who rightly hate sin and uphold the moral laws of God, often have no other "hammer" to contend against pornography than to tell professing Christians who struggle with sexual sins that they need to "really" get saved so they can be victorious. Yet, assurance of salvation is a prerequisite to overcoming sin (Romans 6:11-14, Ephesians 6:17). And this assurance, since it is to be absolute, is impossible if our works play any part. Instead, works and fruit offer a partial evidence that we will be "saved" at the Judgment Seat and get a "well done." We are not called to have certain assurance of reward, but only a bold confidence. Assurance of salvation in eternity should be based entirely on Christ's work. Any other foundation is sinking sand.

Others, who rightly understand the grace of God in eternal justification, are often weak on Biblical standards. Thus, one side (the "lordship salvationists") destroys the power of assurance, and is a bedfellow to Romanism. The other side ("easy believism") is often devilishly antinomian in regard to practical sanctification, producing a softness and effeminacy in warriors who are commanded to fight manfully onward. One side fights manfully, but under the wrong banner of law, instead of grace. The other side has the right banner, but will not fight manfully; it too often leads saints to sleep in sin so grace may abound. The one side wrongly puts the truths God gives for practical sanctification in the place of justification. The other side wrongly puts the truths God gives for justification in the place of practical sanctification. The one side wrongly makes eternal justification a monkish struggle. The other side wrongly makes practical sanctification a flowery bed of ease. Brethren, these things ought not so to be!

Therefore, the doctrinal weapon against this modern Goliath of pornography is to give people the full Gospel: Salvation in eternity is by grace through faith alone. It is not of works. In fact, if you are not regularly slandered as an antinomian in regard to salvation in eternity, you probably are not teaching Paul's Gospel in its pure form (Romans 3:8). But this true Gospel also contains a "hope" (Colossians 1:22-23). The teaching of reward according to works in regard to the Judgment Seat and the Millennial Reign is the proper "hammer." God is not soft on Christian sinners who will not repent. There are abundant warnings to Christian fornicators in the Bible (1 Corinthians 3:16-17, 6:9,13, 10:6-11, Galatians 5:19, Hebrews 12:15-17, etc.). These warnings need to be taught to this generation in full force. If they were needed then, they are certainly needed in this perilous hour! We have churches filled with people enslaved to pornography because the promises and WARNINGS of God to His people are not thundered from pulpits in the right measure. We have churches that are hard on false professors. But where are the churches that will warn true professors? These are the ones the Devil seeks to sift as wheat.

But there is more. The above deals with one's motivations. We will now deal with the actual warfare. Christians who indulge in pornography on TV or Internet do not need much counseling. They do not need to sit in a circle and talk about the sin. They need to obey the Bible's commandments in regard to HOW to FIGHT. Notice the following inspired words:

Romans 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and MAKE NOT PROVISION for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

Matthew 5:30 And if thy right hand offend thee, CUT IT OFF, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

Proverbs 5:8 Remove thy way FAR from her, and COME NOT NIGH THE DOOR of her house:

2 Timothy 2:22 FLEE also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, WITH THEM that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

Commands such as these could be multiplied. They reveal that the way to overcome the pornography stranglehold is to STARVE THE SIN. In other words, before a man plucks out his eye, he might try a less drastic measure and pluck out his TV or computer! But the principle is the same. I have preached this for years, and have seen tremendous results in the lives of people. It is the BIBLE way. To try to fight pornography and keep a computer hooked up to the Internet or a TV hooked up to cable or satellite, fills the Devil with glee. It is useless. It is disobedience to God.

There are so many out there who profess to hate their sin. They profess to hate the fact that they are slaves to pornography. But when they are given GOD'S answer to their problem (i.e. make not provision), they often will not hear it. Perhaps they secretly love their sin, and in their realization that they are often powerless (due to the wrong method of warfare) they feel they can cast blame on God. When they hear God's reply, they realize that their crutch is being removed. Therefore, if you are struggling with pornography, you must disconnect your computer from the Internet and seal up any other crack by which the vile dung is seeping into your life. Why will you stubbornly and foolishly wait? Love God, love your family, love your soul. MOVE NOW!

I actually had one man (who was struggling with this horrible sin) tell me through E-mail that he could not give up his computer since he liked to check the weather online! What INSANITY! Others reply that they can make extra money by having a computer, or that their job depends on the Internet. I believe these men should move to a smaller house and get another job. A job is certainly less precious than a hand or eye (Matthew 5:30)! The point is, there IS NO EXCUSE. Fight God's way, or be overcome. The pathetic, effeminate whimpering is disgusting. If a man refuses to deal with his sin and overcome it God's way, and he will still walk in it, he should be disfellowshipped from the assembly until he repents (1 Corinthians 5).

What Families Can Do

If there is already a problem:

-Get rid of the computer
-Get rid of the Internet

If there is not yet a problem:

-Get a porn blocker or filter
-Covenant with the wife to check the "history" and the "cookies" on the computer regularly. Set up the browser so the history will not be deleted. Have constant and open accountability in the home and office.

What Churches Can Do

Almost no man in my church possesses a TV hooked up to the world's programming. You cannot control what comes over the screen, and you must therefore be tempted before you can act to remove the temptation. And then, once drunken and drugged, how will we be quick to act? And before long, we will not even have the discernment to recognize the temptations. In regard to the computer, some men have likewise junked it. I praise God for these warriors. For those who use the computer/Internet for business or godly purposes (and are not struggling with temptation), our church has instituted the following plan of defense. If someone is already tempted, I teach that they should get rid of the Internet or computer, quickly! But to avoid future temptation, the following practical advice will save your men in these perilous times. I got the idea from Mike Pearl ("Train Up a Child"). It is Biblical and necessary. I will let him explain it:

"I challenge you. Let us who name ourselves after the holy man of Galilee make a statement to the 'church' and the world. Let us proclaim in no uncertain terms that we believe Jesus is worthy of our whole hearts. Let us demonstrate that there is a remnant that does indeed walk in truth. Let us get certified as real Christian men. Find three or four other Christian men who will covenant with you to certify that you are free from porn on the web....Your computer will be open to inspection at any time by any of the men with whom you have entered covenant. You will never erase the web history on your computer unless in the presence of one of the other men. You will welcome one of your covenant brothers to walk in unannounced and search your web history periodically. You will do the same for each of them. As a group you will make it known that you have been certified, and you will challenge others to form additional groups and maintain their certification. Men who have the web and will not open themselves to inspection should be noted as not walking in truth. We don't do this because we don't trust ourselves. We do it, first of all, because we are jealous for the testimony of the church and the Lord Jesus Christ. Secondly, because we want to provide support for those weaker brothers who may need oversight and encouragement. Write a certificate of certification and have all the men sign it. Frame it and place it on the wall of your home or office. Be bold. Be holy. Our Lord is worthy. 'Provide things honest in the sight of all men' Romans 12:17. 'Abstain from all appearance of evil' 1 Thessalonians 5:22..." ("The Challenge," By Michael Pearl, May - June 2002)

I believe every fundamental pastor in America should step into the pulpit this Lord's Day and OPENLY DECLARE that his computer is open for inspection IMMEDIATELY, at any random time, by his brothers. We are not talking about personal files. We are talking about searching for evidence of vile SIN. By his example, the pastor can then lead the other men to enter into the same covenant. Our churches will then be protected. The strong will not be a stumblingblock for the weak.

There may soon come a time when the computer/Internet will be impossible to manage - when sin and temptation will be flashed before our eyes before we are able to avoid it. On such a day, I will ask for all Kingdom Alert subscribers to send me their postal addresses, and I will mail my newsletter out in hard copy. And I will decry the Internet as loudly as I preach against worldly TV (which flashes scenes and sensuous commercials BEFORE the viewer can move to avoid seeing them). But for now, by manly diligence and fortitude, the Internet can be used for good and MANAGED - IF the proper steps are taken by pastors to lead the men into accountability covenants.

Through reviving the love and fear of God and His Law in our churches, and by obeying HIS WAYS in regard to how to fight our battles, we may indeed overcome the sin of pornography in our churches! Praise the Lord!

An Example of Our Accountability Covenant

"I hereby do declare, before God and witnesses, on this day____ of ______ year_____, that if ever I find myself tempted to view pornography on the Internet, I will get rid of the Internet immediately. I will not try to fight this sin in any other manner but by fleeing it and starving it, according to the word of God (Romans 13:14, 2 Timothy 2:22, Proverbs 5:8). As long as I am not struggling with such a sin, I will possess a computer hooked up to the Internet for godly purposes. I will not delete the history of the web sites I view, and will set up my computer so this history will not automatically be deleted. Out of love for Jesus Christ, my family, my church, and my own soul, I will allow my brothers to come to my home (or office, if applicable) at anytime, unannounced (at reasonable hours, once a month), and inspect my computer for evidence of the vile sin of pornography. I also understand that this sin is so despicable and vile that I cannot continue to attend church and fellowship with the brethren if I will not repent of it and obey God in how to rid my life of it. Signed_____________."

Note:
Let it be known to all Kingdom Alert subscribers, that I have declared the above before the men of my church. Will you do the same? Also, my e-mail program is Eudora Light, version 1.5.2. It does NOT automatically show any spam picture files. Any pornographic spam that gets through is immediately deleted, and I do not have to view any pictures automatically. If you have to view sensual pictures before you are able to delete them, get another E-mail program, or get a spam blocker or filter of some kind - or go back to writing letters the old-fashioned way. Send me your address and we will mail you the Kingdom Alert through the post office!

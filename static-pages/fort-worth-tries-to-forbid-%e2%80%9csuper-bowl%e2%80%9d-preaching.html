        <h1>FORT WORTH TRIES TO FORBID Â€ŒSUPER-BOWLÂ€ PREACHING</h1>
        <div id="content">
            We have been street preaching in the same place in downtown Fort Worth, every Friday night for 11 years. This week, however, in preparation for the Super Bowl that is coming to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, we were met with a message from the police. The city sidewalks have been â€œrentedâ€ by the NFL. They are nowÂ considered private property, and thus, there will be no preaching, tracts, etc.

After speaking with our lawyer in Austin, we decided to stay. The policeman who was told to give us the message (a very good, and just-minded officer ), appealed to his sergeant. A meeting was soon set up between the pastor Â and the sergeant, where we were informed that we had it all wrong. A new ordinance had been passed for a few weeks forbidding any type of activity like street preaching and signs and tracts. We could be issued expensive citations or taken to jail for breaking this new ordinance.

We agreed to stop passing out tracts until we researched this situation further. But we said that we will continue our preaching as normal. Thankfully, our preachers were able to lift up their voices without any further hindrances.

In preaching, we pointed out the million babies that are killed every year by abortion, and the fact that by age 45, 1 out of 3 women will have had at least one abortion. God rebuked Israel for slaying His children (Ezekiel 36). Is it therefore a time to party in Texas? Did Nineveh party and celebrate when God was angry with their sins? Or did they fast and repent? Are the sins of America really less than Assyria? With the light that we have received as a nation? It is time to receive Jesus as Saviour, and repent of our national sins. This is the message that Satan tried to hinder in Fort Worth on Friday night (1-28-11). Thank God the door remained open to speak the truth one more time!

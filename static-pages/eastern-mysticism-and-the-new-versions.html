        <h1>EASTERN MYSTICISM AND THE NEW VERSIONS</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Psalm 32:9
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

James 3:15
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.

Jude 1:10
But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Bibles teach a New Age, Eastern Mystical way to sensual knowledge, opposing God's Perfect King James Bible, which uplifts the rational mind of man.

Hebrews 5:
13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

"As usual we put feeling first, and faith second and fact last of all. Now Godâ€™s invariable rule in everything is fact first, faith second, and feeling last of all... and it is striving against the inevitable when we seek to change this order."
- Hannah Whitall Smith

Christians are to follow the facts of the written Word with the mind that God gave them. Christians are to come to this written Word with the willingness to study it as the only final, absolute standard. The Bible predicted that in the last days Christians would follow feelings instead of the objective, absolute, rational testimony of the Holy Spirit found in the Word. New so-called bibles echo the carnal, mystical spirit of this age and in fact help promote it. The following verse comparisons are only a sample of the subtle attacks Satan has made upon the Bible. Lying devils have sought to substitute a subjective, mystical, fuzzy, word for the real, written Word that can be read and studied. Also, instead of coming to God as creatures made in the image of God with reason; many are deceived today into replacing this growth in knowledge and discernment with the soulish, emotional, passionate, intuitive path to earthly, sensual, devilish, mystical, experiential wisdom. (Jms.3:15, Jude 1:19)

Quotes from Satanism and New Age, Eastern religion, proving that the Devil desires you to walk by your Feelings instead of your enlightened Understanding.(Eph.4:18)

"The mind is the great enemy."
- Aleister Crowley, Magick, p.29

"The formalized beginning and end of the (satanic) ceremony acts as a dogmatic, anti- intellectual device... "
- The Satanic Bible

"The no-mind not thinks no-thoughts about nothings."
- Buddha

"There is no need, therefore to understand the language of the mantra, nor is there any need for mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting the mahamantra. It is automatic coming from the spiritual platform.."
- A.C. Bhaktivedanta

*The basic aim of these (eastern mystical) techniques seems to be to silence the thinking mind and to shift the awareness from the rational to the intuitive mode of consciousness.

These eastern mystical, satanic, new-age beliefs have even entered many "fundamental" churches. The following verse by verse comparisons of the King James Bible with modern corrupted versions, (N.I.V.) prove that Satan, as a subtle serpent, has slowly, silently, prepared the churches to be corrupted by new Bibles for an eastern mystical, new-age invasion. These verses are only a sample of hundreds that have been likewise corrupted!


KJV 
Psalm 15: 1 LORD, who shall abide

Which Bible version would the Devil have you read? Note these words from Elizabeth Clare Prophet, a New Age astrologer and so-called prophet!:

"Observe times does not appear in modern translations, which are considered to be more accurate and literal than the King James Version."

(p.20, The Astrology of the Four Horsemen)

She continually uses the new versions against the King James Bible, to justify her New Age practices!

2 Timothy 4:
2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

Perhaps one might reply that some of the above verses contained only slight changes. Yet, such objections do not take into account the nature of Satanic deception. Satan is called a Serpent:

Genesis 3:1
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

If Satan can cause one to simply doubt absolutes, he is able to snare his prey.

2 Corinthians 11:3
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

Proverbs 30:
5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

        <h1>THE ORIGIN OF VALENTINE'S DAY AND THE HEART SYMBOL</h1>

            Jeremiah 10:3 For the customs of the people are vain...

What is the origin of Valentine's Day and the popular heart symbol? They are certainly Pagan:

"[Valentine is a] Roman saint...His festival is celebrated on February 14. The practice of sending love tokens on this date apparently originated in a Roman custom of boys drawing girls' names by lot in honor of Juno Februalis [a goddess] at the Lupercalia festival which was celebrated at about the same date."
("Grolier's Encyclopedia," 1960)

"In the first place, there is an utter destitution of authentic records concerning this alleged saint - bishop, and martyr [Valentine]...But further: - that pernicious substitution of Christianized heathenism, for pagan heathenism, which took place in the fourth century, is signalized in this particular instance, in a manner which should peremptorily have forbidden the admission of the name in a Protestant Calendar. It was a miserable folly, at the first, which perpetuated and sanctioned the usages attaching to the worship ofÂ Juno Februalis,Â by putting a martyr in the room of the goddess..."
(Isaac Taylor, "Ancient Christianity," 1812)

"Februo" in Greek is "purgo" in Latin. Februalis was the Roman goddess of purifications (for women). In Greece, she was called Juno. Sacrifices were made to her for the dead in the month of February. During the Lupercalia festival, animals were sacrificed, and priests ran naked in the streets, etc. It was a very important festival in early Rome. Mark Antony (master of the Luperci College of Priests) chose the Lupercalia festival to offer the crown to Julius Caesar. During this festival, women also offered cakes to the queen of heaven:

Jeremiah 7:18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.

It angers God when His people follow the idolatrous customs of the wicked. He forbids His people to even mention the name of other gods (Exodus 23:13), except to reprove them.

Brewster's, "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable" (1898), believes that the name "Valentine" was actually chosen because of its similarity with "galentin" (meaning a woman's lover or seducer).

All of this stems from the days when Roman Catholics, such as pope Gregory, decided to use pagan customs and practices to pacify the pagans. The names of the gods and goddesses were changed in an attempt to justify the adoption of heathen practices. Roman Catholicism merges paganism and counterfeit Christianity, and has historically enforced this corruption by the sword of the state.

The very "heart" that is associated with Valentine's Day, and is found almost everywhere as a symbol of love, is actually the ancient symbol of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and debauchery. His sign was the leopard spot (similar to the heart symbol). Leopard skins were worn in homage to Dionysus. It is a symbol that has been associated with fornication and lust since ancient times. In the worship of Dionysus (i.e. Bacchus, Satan), the people would stir themselves into a frenzy, with wild dancing, as animals were ripped apart among the mad mobs.

Hislop, in "The Two Babylons," reveals that Nimrod (the ancient type of the Antichrist in Genesis 10, whose kingdom was Babel or Babylon) actually means "leopard tamer." From ancient times, the leopard was associated with the worship of Nimrod, who was called different things in different cultures after the division at the Tower of Babel. We see this in Egypt, where he is called Osiris; and he is pictured as arrayed in leopard's skin, with his priests arrayed in the same manner. In Greece, he is called Dionysus (or Bacchus among the Romans; and Tammuz in the Bible - see Ezekiel 8:14); and he is shown riding upon a leopard, dressed in leopard's skin, etc.

It is sad thing in our day that the leopard print is now showing up on clothes, purses, etc. of young girls. Even if someone did not understand the ancient connections to Nimrod/Dionysus, this type of dress, even today, is associated with harlots and lewd women. Is it a "cute" thing to dress children as pimps and prostitutes? Many Sodomite, worldly clothes designers think so. And they are laughing all the way to the bank. Should Christians allow their daughters to dress as if they walked out of a lewd bar?

Roman Catholics believe the heart symbol was derived from a vision of the "sacred heart." Nevertheless, even in modern culture, the heart is often linked to Cupid. And who is Cupid? Hislop reveals him to be another form of Nimrod, the leopard tamer (called a mighty hunter in the Bible).

The modern Valentine heart is linked to the worship of Dionysus in another way. 2 Macc. 6:7, while certainly not part of the Holy Scriptures, nevertheless offers some historical insight concerning Dionysus (or Bacchus). During the "four hundred silent years" between the Testaments, the Jews were compelled to join in the procession of this false god carrying Ivy. Dionysus is often pictured with an Ivy wreath. In all of these ancient images, the Ivy leaves are in the exact shape as Valentines (the heart symbol). Cupid is shown with this same Ivy garland. Vishnu in India wears the same heart symbol:

"There is another hieroglyphic connected with Bacchus that goes not a little to confirm this - that is, the Ivy branch. No emblem was more distinctive of the worship of Bacchus than this. Wherever the rites of Bacchus were performed, wherever his orgies were celebrated, the Ivy branch was sure to appear. Ivy, in some form or other, was essential to these celebrations. The votaries carried it in their hands, bound it around their heads, or had the Ivy leaf even indelibly stamped upon their persons."
(Hislop, "The Two Babylons")

The Valentine is the ancient symbol of Bacchus (Tammuz). It may be linked to the leopard spot of Nimrod. Regardless, as Dionysus is seen as the god of debauchery and lewdness, it is no wonder that the Ivy leaf, or heart symbol, has become the modern symbol of "love."

An argument can be made that unto the pure, all things are pure. And certainly, there are many innocent Christians who are wisely simple concerning evil. But there is a simple-mindedness that we are commanded to avoid (Psalms 19:7; Proverbs 1:4, 22; 7:7; Romans 16:18; etc.):

Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.
16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.

Proverbs 9:13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

The "all things" of the Bible, that are lawful, and pure (but not always expedient), are things that are lawful and pure! While we may use the world, and not abuse it, there are scores of Bible verses that teach that God forbids His people to be SPOTTED by the world (worldliness, etc.):

Jude 1:23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

2 Peter 3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.

1 Timothy 6:14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

Ephesians 5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

Achan was stoned for taking a goodly Babylonish garment, etc., into his house. Jacob, when he revived, commanded his household to change their garments. The New Testament command us to "touch not the unclean thing." God warns us that the testimony we present before His adversaries matters a great deal. When they can legitimately mock us for sin and compromise, He is not pleased:

Ezekiel 16:27...the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.

Titus 2:5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

Based on these Scriptures, and others, it is wise and prudent for Christians to abstain from even the appearance of evil, as commanded by God (1 Thessalonians 5:22), and to avoid things that are associated with Pagans, Catholics, idolaters, Sodomites, etc. (e.g. so-called "peace signs," spiked chains and belts, leopard prints, and such like that try to make, otherwise, godly girls "boyish," or flirty, or wild, etc., in appearance). While we sincerely appreciate the kindness of innocent people who may show affection by sending a "happy Valentines" greeting, there are better, more Christian ways to love one another.

BE CAREFUL HOW YOU HEAR:

In conservative Christian circles, whatever standards (or doctrine, light, etc.) we agree to, if we stop growing, and get settled on our lees, are seen as true "convictions." Everything else that we will not submit to, is painted as a "preference." But it just may be that there are many so-called "preferences" out there, that should be our convictions. And if we will avoid becoming like the foolish king who will no longer be admonished (Ecclesiastes 4:13), the Lord will continue to show us many things. It is never too late to grow. The Lord desires that we flourish in fruitfulness, even in our mature years (Psalms 92:13-14). It may be that we have become hardened in pride, or just plain lazy or weary in well doing after many years. The Lord teaches us that if we reject light, He will begin to take away light that we used to have. In the same way, if we respond to light when it is given to us, He will open up more light to us:

Luke 8:18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.

Our ability to understand truth is largely based upon our WILLINGNESS:

John 7:17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

How often people reply that they just can't "understand" a doctrine or teaching, or what others see as a so-called conviction. While the danger of adding to the Word certainly exists, it may be that these people are simply not willing to obey or sacrifice in that area. The cost may be too high. As Saul often justified his sins on the basis of some good thing that he could do, or was doing, so many will not receive certain things as true, because of some "good" thing they would have to sacrifice. Unless we are willing to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, we will not know the perfect will of God (Romans 12:1-3). As the fool, we will be deceiving ourselves about our pursuit of God's knowledge:

Proverbs 17:16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

If we seek God's wisdom more than riches, with all our heart, then we shall understand the fear of the Lord, and all that comes with it; and we will continue to grow (Proverbs 2:3-5).

HYMN TO THE WELFARE STATE

The Government is my Shepherd,
Therefore, I need not work.
It alloweth me to lie down on a good job.
It leadeth me beside still factories.
It destroyeth my initiative.
It leadeth me in the path of a parasite for politics' sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of laziness and deficit-spending,
I will fear no evil, for the government is with me.
It prepareth an economic utopia for me, by appropriating the earnings of my grandchildren.
It filleth my head with false security:
My inefficiency runneth over.
Surely the government should care for me all the days of my life,
And I shall dwell in a fool's paradise forever."
(Anonymous, 1960)

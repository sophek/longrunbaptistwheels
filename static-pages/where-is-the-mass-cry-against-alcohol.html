            WHERE IS THE MASS CRY AGAINST ALCOHOL? "Alcohol: 'The Most Dangerous Substance In Society' - "The director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism calls alcohol 'the most widespread and damaging substance we have in society.' The May 7 U.S. News has an 8-page article showing, among other things, how alcohol alters brain chemistry. New science uses new imaging techniques and shows how alcohol can rewire the circuitry of the brain, eroding its ability to feel pleasure and act wisely, and replacing it with a locus for intense craving and destructive behavior. The article terms alcoholism a disease [the Bible calls it sin, drunkenness] that interferes with home life, work, interpersonal relationships, and eventually with health.'" (Calvary Contender) Comments: Alcohol is called by this one authority the most damaging substance in society. Why then does the worldly media often smile upon casual drink, but frown upon casual smoking? It is almost frightening to see how the U.S. media and government campaign against tobacco has altered the actual mentality of the masses. Was this some kind of an experiment or just a money grab? I do wonder. Tobacco harms the body. I am morally against it (yet, I hear it is good in gardens to ward off certain insects). I do not use tobacco in any form. But the hysteria against tobacco is bizarre when other questionable or harmful substances are warmly embraced by the masses and their media pipers. These harmful substances have just as many medical reports (propaganda) to support their sales as the tobacco companies. Is the pipe tobacco of a Charles Spurgeon significantly worse than caffeine? I wonder. While society now suddenly hates tobacco, it is presently in love with caffeine. It has just been reported that McDonald's is getting into the gourmet coffee house business (literally). Some investment firms are now serving gourmet coffee. Oh, and the latest news is that gourmet coffee is so popular that CHURCHES are now getting in on the money. The Federalist reports: "'What initially proved difficult, but has since been overcome, is why a cup of coffee costs $3.35 rather than 50 cents. We had to educate northern Indiana on how to order. Now they're hooked.' - Dave Allen, spokesman for the Family Christian Center in Munster, Ind., on the addition of a Starbuck's coffee franchise INSIDE their church. The 6,000 member megachurch paid $50,000 for the franchise." (Federalist, May 4) And what about other substances? White sugar (i.e. sugar cane absolutely stripped by man's processing) is a substance with no food value, vitamins, etc. It is commonly linked to many physical problems by nutritionists. And what about that weird chemical sweetener stuff in the little square packages? Isn't it at least a bit hypocritical to look down on a casual smoker while at the same time one is surfeiting with junk food of no food value (which destroys B vitamins, etc.)? Okay, since so many are now staring at the computer with a blank look, I will make another point. Why is it morally proper (according to the worldlings) to drink alcohol socially, but it is now wrong to smoke tobacco? Is it only because of second hand smoke? There seems to be more to it. I am not interested in a sue crazy government campaign against every harmful or questionable substance. I am only making a point that it is amazing how much control the media has in shaping public opinion. This thought certainly makes me want to continue my endeavor to encourage Christians (and everyone else, for that matter) to free themselves from the seduction of the worldly TV tube. It is certainly Big Brother thought control. (KA #113)

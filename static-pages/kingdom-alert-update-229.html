-ANOTHER FENCE DOWN: MY THOUGHTS ON THE SUPER (TOILET) BOWL

-HOLY SWEETNESS: NOT H.F.C.S.!

ANOTHER FENCE DOWN: MY THOUGHTS ON THE SUPER (TOILET) BOWL
**********************************************************************
Many years ago, we ditched television, and have been blessed ever since.
What a liberty! Therefore, please know that I did not watch the Super
Bowl. I say this, lest anyone think my above title is due to firsthand
knowledge. I have knowledge of the disgusting events at this years' Super
Bowl from AFA e-mails, and WorldNetDaily, etc. I decided to type words
such as "Baptist" and "Super Bowl Party," etc., into an Internet search
engine. I was saddened by what I saw. Multitudes of churches had "youth
Super Bowl fellowships," and many churches cancelled their services to
have a Super Bowl party right in the church building. What did they do
when nakedness was shown? What did Christian fathers do, at home, as their
families gazed at the screen?

I am afraid that while this may cause many to get out of the lukewarm
middle and finally be convinced that worldly entertainment cannot in any
manner be justified, there is also a dire consequence that is possible.
Now that sensually dancing cheerleaders, music about drugs, nudity, (and
other things not fit to even be mentioned) have been shown in the actual
CHURCHES and living rooms of millions of Christians, IT HAS THEREFORE
BROKEN DOWN ANOTHER FENCE. If Christians will have dirty dancing in their
churches, immodest dressing, and the latest "groove" music, IN THE NAME OF
BEING SEEKER-FRIENDLY, what will this mean that the world has taken one
more giant step towards Hell?

The world is already showing nudity in R-rated, and even PG-movies (which
Christians have been flocking to for years). And we have reports that this
is common on prime-time television. The only thing "new" is that this
nudity and filth occurred during the Super-Bowl.

Of course, the "conservative" world, and the Christian talk-show world is
up in arms! Oh how "shocked" they are! One Christian radio host, the day
after Janet Jackson exposed herself in front of millions of views, moaned
something to the effect of, "We thought Justin Timberlake was going to be
our savior." What Bible believing Christian has even HEARD of Justin
Timberlake? This hypocrisy needs to be rebuked. And I may hurt some
feelings here, but please know that I say this out of sincere love and
sorrow:

Any mature Christian who watched the Super Bowl on TV, has no reason at
all to be SHOCKED at Janet Jackson exposing herself. Such a Christian has
no reason at all to feel BETRAYED by the world. We are dealing with the
WILL here, not the intellect. Can a CHRISTIAN, with a STRAIGHT-FACE,
honestly say:

"Uh, I just expected Janet Jackson to be immodest and dance SLEAZY, to the
sleazy lyrics, while all the cheerleaders strutted immodestly to the
raunchy music. In other words, all I wanted [burp] was a little FAMILY FUN
on the Lord's Day, and then she had to go do THAT [burp]! What is the
world coming to! I can't even skip church and watch some cheerleaders and
Janet Jackson's fine musical talent without having to view nakedness!"

This is like a man stopping at a rest-stop, choosing to eat his lunch IN
the public restroom, and then complaining about the flies!

The truth of the matter is that thousands of Christians are simply
ADDICTED to worldly entertainment, and this addiction has blinded them to
the following FACTS:

1. Every Bible-believing Christian should have known BEFORE HE OR SHE
VIEWED this past Super Bowl, that the Super Bowl is not FIT for Christian
entertainment since it shows immodest CHEERLEADERS with CLOSE-UPS. Are the
churches shocked? Do they feel betrayed by the world? They betrayed God
long ago.

2. Every Bible-believing Christian should have known BEFORE HE OR SHE
VIEWED this past Super Bowl, that the Super Bowl is not FIT for Christian
entertainment since it shows football players MOUTHING CUSS WORDS.

3. Every Bible-believing Christian should have known BEFORE HE OR SHE
VIEWED this past Super Bowl, that the Super Bowl is not FIT for Christian
entertainment since the Bible in Ecclesiastes 1:8 teaches that "the eye is
not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing..." Therefore,
it was obvious that commercials must get increasingly SINFUL unless there
has been a REVIVAL in the land. Now, has there been a true REVIVAL of
holiness? Then on what basis could ANYONE have been caught OFF-GUARD by
the immorality of the Super Bowl? Has there not been evidence that the
"stars" have been trying to do outrageous things to sell records?

4. Every Bible-believing Christian should have known BEFORE HE OR SHE
VIEWED this past Super Bowl, that the Super Bowl is not FIT for Christian
entertainment since it occurred on the Lord's Day, when many are having
their evening service.

The following verses would have kept every Christian from watching the
Super Bowl in light of how evil and raunchy the world has become
(especially in its entertainment):

James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
himself UNSPOTTED FROM THE WORLD.

Jude 1:23 ...hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

Psalms 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that
hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.

1 Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good
manners.

Romans 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

***********************************
HOLY SWEETNESS: NOT H.F.C.S.!
***********************************

Are you addicted to high-fructose-corn-syrup (HFCS)? It is in practically
everything. Just about everyone in our age is addicted to it
"spiritually," at least; as I will explain momentarily. Most are unaware
of the role diet is playing in the poor health of the nation. But
Christians have no excuse for being in the dark on the subject. Food is
often used in the Scriptures to picture spiritual truths. Therefore, as
food is stripped of nutrients (some that have not even been discovered
yet), and adulterated with chemicals, hormones, pesticides, etc., is it
any wonder that poor physical health results? Does not the analogy to the
spiritual world demand it?

Let us lay a foundation. I have spent much time reproving the passive
spirit of this age that seeks to shut the mouths of the saints by
replacing traditional, Biblical soul-winning with "lifestyle evangelism."
The Bible certainly teaches that God is pleased to use sanctified,
separated vessels (2 Timothy 2:21). We should therefore strive to have a
good testimony before all men, and live a lifestyle that matches our
preaching (1 Timothy 3:7, Romans 2:21). Yet, we should remember that the
rich man in Hell-fire didn't want anyone to go HUG his relatives (Luke
16:28)! He wanted someone to TESTIFY unto them; to warn them! How shall
they hear without a PREACHER (Romans 10:14)?

A new, sugar-coated "Jesus" has been manufactured by the world. And many
professing Christians have adopted him. How else can we explain this
modern addiction to "sweetness" that is so devoid of any truth that cuts,
convicts, or divides? Can it honestly be maintained that this new "Jesus"
is the Jesus of our Holy Scriptures?:

Matthew 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not
to send peace, but a sword.
35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the
daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in
law.
36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

John 18:37...To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the
world, that I should BEAR WITNESS UNTO THE TRUTH. Every one that is of the
truth heareth my voice.

Shall we follow the Scriptures, or shall we follow the spirit of this
world? If we follow the world, we will compromise truth, doctrine, and
holiness, for the sake of being nice, sweet, gentle and kind. But such
sugar-coated "kisses of Judas" are murderous! It is truth that makes men
free (John 8:33).

Of course, we should never tarnish the truth by a sinful meanness. It is
sadly true that there are some preachers who appear to follow more after
Nabal, than they do the Saviour (1 Samuel 25:14,17). Yet, there are
thousands more "parasol preachers" who pride themselves on blowing "Joab
kisses" to everyone in the name of "sugar," as they fail to warn them of
ruin and Hell-fire (2 Samuel 20:9-10). God-forbid!

We need to have Spiritual discretion on when to be firm, and when to be
gentle:

Proverbs 15:23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word
SPOKEN IN DUE SEASON, how good is it!

Proverbs 25:11 A word FITLY SPOKEN is like apples of gold in pictures of
silver.
12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a WISE
REPROVER upon an OBEDIENT ear.

Sometimes a "reprover" is not "wise." He or she may lack the right motive,
the right tone, or the right time, etc. However, in this age, the
"obedient" ears are growing increasingly scarce! Even so, this is no
excuse to become harsh and unnecessarily cruel in speech:

Proverbs 15:2 The tongue of the wise USETH KNOWLEDGE ARIGHT: but the mouth
of fools poureth out foolishness.

We must therefore study the Scriptures, and pray for discretion on when,
and in what manner, to speak truth:

Jude 1:22 And OF SOME have COMPASSION, making a difference:
23 And OTHERS save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even
the garment spotted by the flesh.

We are to hate even garments spotted by the flesh. And from the looks of
how some women dress in modern churches, there are "flesh spots" all over
their garments! Where there should be some clothes, there is a spot of
FLESH showing through. But how many hate such garments? Do they not lead
to lust, and often to fornicate and adultery?

The general teaching in these verses in Jude is grasped by most
commentators:

"The thought is to be very gentle and pitiful to those disturbed by
doubt....And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire....By
snatching away from sin by the most vigorous effort. By stern
preaching....All the while abhorring their sins." (People's NT Commentary)

This is the BIBLICAL balance! The world (and the majority of professing
Christians) would tell us that we should never use the second method
mentioned in verse 23. There is a DEVILISH SWEETNESS that has invaded
Christendom. We see that discretion must be used in whether to be
"motherly" (1 Thessalonians 2:7), or "fatherly" (1 Thessalonians 2:11-12);
in whether to encourage, or reprove. And notice that we must go IN and
snatch them OUT of the fire; but we must NOT allow the fires and flesh of
sin to consume us! We must keep a hatred for sin, that many might see as
extreme. Jude teaches to CONTEND for the faith. And he tells us that there
are others that must be saved by strong preaching. He then tells us that
as we seek to bring drowning souls out of the water, we must not jump in
and drown ourselves! But many are taught today to go with friends to bars
and ungodly theaters for the purpose of "evangelism." The old Geneva bible
notes, at least on this passage, are interesting for an historical
perspective:

"Among those who wander and go astray, the godly have to use this choice,
that they handle SOME of them gently, and that others being even in the
very flame, they endeavour to save with severe and sharp instruction of
the present danger..."
(Geneva Notes)

How different the spirit of the world is today. Many have taken toleration
to such an ungodly extreme that they would faint if they heard someone
using "severe and sharp instruction" for the purpose of trying to save
people from danger. Some people are all sugar! This is bad. We can't just
drink organic fruit juice all day and expect to be blessed! (And it goes
without saying that we can't drink things that do not have LIFE in them
and expect to thrive.) Strawberries and blueberries are good to throw in
the blender; but we better make sure we regularly, if not daily, have some
collards, spinach, kale, beet greens, garlic, and such like thrown in as
well!  "Oh, but my children don't like such things." YOU are the parent.
Train them. The first food in my daughter's mouths as babies were mashed
dandelion greens. But when we let our taste-buds rule us, they soon
degenerate, and get delicate; and they will, in the end, cause us to
commit the sin unto death! If God planned to give us the grace to live
until 90, and we allow our taste-buds to lead us to an early grave, then
what is that? Will we not be held accountable for "slow suicide" and the
lost years? Hold on now, before you run away. The natural realm here is
going to show us something about soul winning.

We are a SUGAR GENERATION that is killing itself by an overdose on sweets!
Notice, this is all occurring at the same time that the false "love"
movement is upon us. In fact, it exactly parallels!

Sugar consumption increased dramatically in the 19th century. Before, it
was only a luxury item. At the same time, the technology of refining the
vitamins away increased. But notice the spiritual analogy:  At the same
time that "refined sugar" was becoming a common item in the diet, the
"Bible Communism" (i.e. Noyes) and the "free love" movement also arose!
They taught (more than a century before the so-called "love generation" of
the 1960's) that marriage is slavery, and that everyone needs to "love one
another" (i.e. fornicate). By the end of the 1900's, infidels and
modernists were pushing for a new "religion of love," that was
pro-humanity. But this was not true love, it was REFINED LOVE!

Is it not ironic that at the same time sugar was being STRIPPED, that
there was a movement that was STRIPPING love of any truth or holiness? The
Devil was everywhere launching an attack on love. His final goal would be
to bring this IMITATION LOVE into the mainstream and destroy marriages,
churches, and the nations.

At the time when refined sugar consumption was increasing like never
before, we had the free love movement, and the infidel movement arising
like never before. And they were advocating a Satanic "sweetness" and
"love" that was spiritually unhealthy. Notice what the infidels were
teaching by the end of the 19th century:

"The Christianity of Christ was a very simple religion. It was A RELIGION
OF LOVE....In place of the 'fear of God,' of the evil one, of endless
torment, let us be attracted to a religion of confidence, of trust, of
hope, OF CHEER AND OF LOVE....we would with Colonel Ingersoll, join the
'great church that holds THE WORLD within its star-lit aisles...that finds
with joy the grains of gold in EVERY creed and floods with light and LOVE
the germs of good in every soul.' In place of the Christian religion, with
its...arrogant and pharisaical officials, its warlike teachings, its
injustice...its lessons of hate, may we be able to realize in the not too
distant future...the 'Dream of Akbar,'...'I dream'd that stone by stone I
rear'd a sacred fane, a temple niether Pagod, Mosque, nor Church, but
loftier, simpler, always open-door'd. To every breath from heaven; and
truth and peace and love and justice came and dwelt therein.'....The dawn
of such a religion is upon us.... 'The hour is coming when men's holy
Church, shall melt away in ever-widening walls, and BE FOR ALL MANKIND;
and in its place, a mightier Church shall come, whose covenant word shall
be THE DEEDS OF LOVE....Men shall not ask his brother any more, 'Believest
thou?' but, LOVEST THOU'?"
(Henry M. Tabor, "Faith or Fact," 1897)

Notice, these infidels were advocating "love" and "sweetness" STRIPPED of
any truth and Biblical godliness. T. D. Talmage, in 1888 rebuked this
"love" movement:

"For many years the platforms of the country rang with talk about A FREE
LOVE millennium. There were meetings at the Academy of Music,
Brooklyn...and all over the land.....Popular themes for such occasions
were the tyranny of man, the oppression of the marriage
relation....Prominent speakers were women with short curls, short dresses,
and very long tongues, everlastingly at war with God because they were
created women; while on the platform sat meek men with soft accent, and
cowed demeanor, apologetic for masculinity, and holding the parasols while
the termagant [i.e. a noisy, brawling woman] orators went on preaching the
GOSPEL OF FREE LOVE. That campaign of about twenty years set more devils
into the marriage relation than will be exorcised in the next fifty."
(T. D. Talmage, 1888)

Immediately, fundamental Christianity was assaulted, and a new "christ"
was offered to the public, who promised to be gentle, sweet and loving:

John 5:43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another
shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

It was "love" stripped of any truth. And sadly, many WOMEN were soon
blinded and addicted to this new, harmful "love":

2 Timothy 3:5 Having A FORM of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
from such turn away.
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
SILLY WOMEN laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

The Bible has therefore warned us not to be led astray with this "refined
love" movement, where "sweetness," robbed of any truth or substance, is
consumed by the simple:
 
Romans 16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
the simple.

In the first decades of the 20th century, many fiery, fundamental
Christians responded to this attack, in obedience to 2 Timothy 4:

2 Timothy 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
REPROVE, REBUKE, exhort with all longsuffering and DOCTRINE.
3 For the time will come when THEY WILL NOT ENDURE SOUND DOCTRINE; but
after their own lusts shall they HEAP to themselves teachers, having
itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto fables.

Now watch what happened: When these godly men were cutting away at the
false religion, and were NOT SPARING, before long, brethren from within
began to scream, "Put down your swords! We can't take it anymore. We don't
like evolution either; and we don't like anti-Christian feminism, and
higher criticism, etc. BUT we can't take all this warfare! We think that
if we will just make friends, everything will be okay, and they will say
they are sorry, and they will be won to our side. But you must not drive
them away by rebuking their errors. Let our children learn from them. Let
them give our flocks what they have to offer. Let us concentrate on what
we agree on." The fundamentalists resisted this attack from within, and
kept fighting. They knew (using our analogy) that an overindulgence of
"sweets," refined of any vitamins, would lead to "spiritual diabetes" and
other grave ailments:

"To raise a hue and cry against this as 'divisive;' to appeal to
compromise for the sake of 'brotherhood' and 'Christian charity' and to
talk about LOVE BEING MORE IMPORTANT IN THE CHURCH THAN CORRECTNESS OF
DOCTRINE, is emotional weakness and fallacious folly....The word
'toleration' must be cut out of the church vocabulary. You cannot find it
in the Bible. It is not a nice word. It is not to be found in good
company. It is a word much used by middle-of-the-road men. It has in it,
no matter how much dissimulated, the crawling, creeping movement of
surrender....Why should the Church tolerate men who no longer tolerate the
Bible as God gave it to us...?"
(I. M. Haldeman, "A King's Penknife, Or, Why I Am Opposed To Modernism,"
1929)

With the spirit of Samuel, they resisted the sugary, compromising spirit
of Saul, and they cut down the false doctrinal trees at their roots:

1 Samuel 15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that
was good, and WOULD NOT UTTERLY DESTROY THEM: but every thing that was
vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the
LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine
ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and
sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better
than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he
hath also rejected thee from being king.
32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the
bitterness of death is past.
33 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy
mother be childless among women. And SAMUEL HEWED AGAG IN PIECES before
the LORD in Gilgal.

These early fundamentalists thus did their best to resist the "sugar
generation." Is it not interesting, that at the same time that this
"sugary" and "refined love" movement was spreading, that LITERAL SUGAR was
being consumed in record proportions? As the world was growing addicted to
REFINED SWEETS, Christians began using SWEETNESS as an excuse not to
reprove and rebuke! They began to ignore 2 Timothy 4:2-4. They even began
to FIGHT against the fundamental preachers! Thus, on one side, the world
and the infidels were pushing their spiritual "soda pop," and on the other
side, many conservative Christians grew weary of the battle. They also
grabbed some "soda-pop" and took off to the "picture show" (spiritually
and literally):

"The fundamentalists of the 1920's were militant, belligerent, and often
hostile toward those who differed with them. AFTER WORLD WAR II
[1939-1945] a MOVEMENT EMERGED in American Christianity which followed the
doctrines of the older Fundamentalism BUT manifested a number of different
characteristics....they were theologians WITHOUT MALICE toward those of
other views. They preferred to be called 'Evangelicals' or 'new
Evangelicals.'....they include people such as Billy Graham...[etc.]..."
("Review and Expositor," Vol. LXXIX, No. 1, 1982)

In other words, these Christians decided that they would be SO SWEET that
they would TOLERATE compromise and sin, deny a literal hell, and embrace
Rome and Hollywoond! And the "fruit" of all of this is seen today the
multitude of "conservative" churches across the nation that cancelled
evening church last Sunday, and instead gazed at NUDITY on the screen, in
the sanctuary. At the same time, it's as if God said:

"Do you want things so SWEET that you will ridicule My servants, and
reject the word of the Lord? Then, have your sweetness. Your nation will
die by sweets!"

I don't know if that is what the Lord said. But it is truly incredible
that the addiction to literal, refined SWEETS has arisen "neck to neck"
with the movement to strip away truth and holiness for the sake of "being
nice." Notice:

"Joseph Beasly in the Kellog Report of 1989 reported that the average
American's consumption of sugar in the 1800's was 10 POUNDS. Today it is
conservatively estimated that the average American consumes over 170
POUNDS of refined sugar per year!" (Dr. Scott Johnson; Florida)

Indeed, the Devil's SPIRITUAL goal was to fill churches and the world with
an IMITATION LOVE. It is obvious that after the 1960's, the "false love"
was embraced by many churches and the world at large. The natural world,
again, followed the same course:

"The sugar industry is big: $100 billion per year. As with any other
billion dollar business, there's bound to be a ton of information that
will support such an empire...[White sugar] is made by refining sugar
cane, a process involving many chemicals....The big problem is that the
finished product contains none of the nutrients, vitamins, or minerals of
the original plant....UP TO THE MID 1970's, sucrose [refined sugar] was
the primary sugar consumed by Americans. That changed when manufacturers
discovered a cheaper source of refined sugar: corn. A process was evolved
that could change the natural fructose in corn to glucose, and THEN BY
ADDING SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS, change the glucose back into AN ARTIFICIAL,
SYNTHETIC TYPE OF FRUCTOSE CALLED HIGH FRUCTOSE. (Freeston)....Today high
fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the preferred sweetener in most soft drinks
and processed foods. Read the labels. As of 1997, worldwide production of
HFCS exceeded 8 billion kilograms. (Freeston)....High fructose corn
syrup...cannot be well digested, actually inhibits digestion, is
addicting, and causes a great number of biochemical errors....HFCS IS
ARTIFICIAL: A NON-FOOD..." (Tim O'Shea, "Sugar: The Sweet Thief of Life")

The rise of sugar went from too many healthy sweets in the diet, to almost
nothing but unhealthy sweets with all the vitamins refined out, to an
ARTIFICIAL, synthetic sweetness that is ruining everyone's health! Now
tell me, is this simply a COINCIDENCE? Is it a coincidence that the "love
movement" followed the same course? How "sweet" should we be toward
damnable lies? Notice, again, the parallel in the natural world:

"HOW MUCH SUGAR DO WE REALLY NEED? White sugar, none....But modern needs
are something created by commerce, by advertising, by politics. How many
people do you know who drink at least one 12 oz soft drink per day? If the
sugar from each bottle could be crystallized out, it would amount to 10
teaspoons. (Appleton, p 16) Put 10 teaspoons of sugar in the bottom of an
empty coke bottle and look at it. Is that a lot? In a normal bloodstream,
which is about 5 liters, approximately 2 teaspoons of glucose should be
circulating at any one time. That means that one coke raises the blood
sugar to 5x its normal level, for at least four hours....This is one soft
drink. Do you know anyone who drinks more than one soft drink per day? How
about per hour? Do the math. To that, add the sugar in desserts, ice
cream, jams, jello, artificial fruit drinks, and candy. This is not even
mentioning hidden sugar found in ketchup, processed meats, baby food,
condiments, cereals, and most other processed foods whose label you may
chance to read."
(Tim O'Shea, "Sugar: The Sweet Thief of Life")

"BETWEEN 1960 and 1980, US SOFT DRINK CONSUMPTION INCREASED 300
PERCENT....I remember as a kid having to get a written permission slip
from my mother to drink a bottle of soda in camp....Older readers will
remember that in the 1950s, Coca-Cola came only in a 6 1/2-ounce bottle.
That soon grew into the 12-ounce can. Today, 20-ounce bottles are readily
available from vending machines, and a 64-ounce 600-calorie Double Gulp is
as near as your local 7-Eleven. It always shocks me to see the wall of
soft drinks at Wal-Mart's checkout, with two-liter bottles available for
as little as 88 cents. For a lot of people, sugar is a cheap 'high' that
comes in a brightly colored bottle. Mixed with caffeine (in cola) it is an
especially potent mixture....Believe it or not, even toddlers are being
primed for a lifetime of sugar addiction."
(Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D., "The Master Disease of Our Time")

"'Sugar consumption is off the charts,' said Michael F. Jacobson,
executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest....In
1942, the American Medical Association (AMA) expressed concern about
sweetened carbonated beverages, candy, and other foods rich in sugar but
poor in nutrients. The AMA urged that 'all practical means be taken to
limit consumption' of such foods. Since 1942, soft-drink consumption has
increased about seven-fold (excluding diet soda), and overall sugar
consumption has increased by one-third." (www.cspinet.org/new/sugar.htm)

The Bible's teaching concerning literal honey is crucial information for
the physical body. Those who mock it will have wisdom mock them in the
end:

Proverbs 25:16 Hast thou found honey? EAT SO MUCH AS IS SUFFICIENT FOR
THEE, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
 
Sufficiency is not defined by, "I still desire some more, so I must not
have eaten my sufficient share yet!" "Honey" in the Bible is raw, natural
honey, which contains all of the natural nutrients, minerals and
micronutrients. And the Bible warns of moderation in regard to these
healthy sweets. How much more would God's wisdom warn us here against
"refined" sugars (with none of the valuable nutrients)? And how much more
would it warn us against a non-food, artificial sweetener (HFCS, etc.)?

"Honey" pictures multiple, diverse things in the Bible (from God's words,
to the lips of a strange woman). Yet, one thing it pictures (of which the
moderation warning in Proverbs 25:16 would also apply) is "sweetness" or
"kindness," or "pleasant words" in our conversation:

Proverbs 16:24 PLEASANT WORDS are as an HONEYCOMB, sweet to the soul, and
health to the bones.

Therefore, although only a fool would ignore the LITERAL warning of
Proverbs 25:16 concerning his physical health, there is also a warning
here against speaking "pleasant words" (i.e. spiritual honeycomb) to such
a degree that truth is hidden or compromised. Some brethren desire to be
so "pleasant" that they will allow young saints to march headlong into
error. Now how "pleasant" is that?

And since honey pictures "pleasant words," how much more should our love,
expressed in such conversation, be without hypocrisy? The same age that
has created and become addicted to refined, stripped sugars, has also
become addicted to "pleasant words" stripped of truth:

Romans 12:9 Let LOVE BE WITHOUT DISSIMULATION. Abhor that which is evil;
cleave to that which is good.
10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour
preferring one another;

As the wise, health-conscious man will rid his life of refined and
artificial sweets, so will the wise, spiritually-minded man rid his life
of false, artificial love:

Proverbs 28:23 He that REBUKETH a man afterwards shall find more favour
than he that FLATTERETH with the tongue.

Proverbs 27:5 Open rebuke is better than SECRET LOVE.
6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are
deceitful.
7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter
thing is sweet.

If we have no physical appetite for healthy, unrefined sweets, it may be
because we are too full (v.7)! What refined, stripped sugars, or
artificial sugars (HFCS), are to the body, hypocritical, secret love (i.e.
all sweet to the taste, with no life-giving nutrients) is to the soul. We
must be careful not to separate the sweet side of love from its
nutritional properties:

Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your LOVE may abound yet more and
more IN KNOWLEDGE AND IN ALL JUDGMENT;
10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere
and without offence till the day of Christ;

But in our caution, we must not become so bitter that we think that
everything sweet is of the Devil. We must learn to walk in the sweet side
of love, and show gentleness where it is proper:

Isaiah 43:24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money...

Proverbs 24:13 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the
honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:

Proverbs 16:24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
health to the bones.

Proverbs 12:18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but
the tongue of the wise is health.

Ecclesiastes 10:12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the
lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

Ephesians 4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
the hearers.
31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

1 Peter 3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

Proverbs 31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
law of kindness.

Titus 3:1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all
meekness unto all men.
3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,
and hating one another.

In conclusion, let us follow our Lord, and not the spirit of this world.
The world (and worldly Christians) think that any teaching that goes
against what the flesh wants to do or believe is "lacking in love." On the
other hand, let us also avoid the biting, Nabal spirit. Let us pray and do
all we can to control our tongues, and show "meekness unto all men." In
other words, I think we should get a "Vitamix" and juice more dandelion
and beet greens. Some people are living (dying!) off of empty sweets. On
the other hand, the God who made the "bitter herbs," also made
strawberries and bananas! Let us pray for God's holy balance in our lives.

"BATTLING" WORLDLY ADDICTION PROGRAMS
=============================================
"My name is Jim Battle. I am a black fundamental Baptist preacher on a
very unusual (but very important) mission. Part of my mission is to find
Bible-believing pastors with knees which have not bowed to, and with
mouths which have not kissed, the two idols called "ADDICTION PROGRAMS"
and "PSYCHOLOGY" (1Kings 19:18). If you are one of these pastors, I would
like an opportunity to present my work to your church. For more
information double-click this hyperlink:
"http://www.truthaboutaddictions.org/testimony.htm"

You can contact me by email at jimbattleaxe@aol.com or by phone at (800)
229-9030. I look forward to hearing from you."

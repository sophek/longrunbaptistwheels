DALLAS-FORT WORTH CONFERENCE ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST: MARCH
17th-20th
************************************************************************
Kingdom Baptist Church will be hosting a Bible conference on the Judgment
Seat of Christ/Kingdom accountability, MARCH 17-20th (Thursday through
Sunday). These meetings will be held in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Please
mark this date on your calendar, and plan to attend! Keep watching the
Kingdom Alert (or our web site: http://www.kingdombaptist.org), for the
line up of speakers, exact place, schedule, and other details. If you
already know you are planning on attending, please e-mail me at
pastor@kingdombaptist.org. Also, please e-mail us if you would like to
stay with someone, and avoid hotel costs. The Second Coming of Christ to
establish His Messianic Kingdom, and the believer's accountability in
relation to it, are wrapped up in practically every doctrine of the Bible.
This is one of the most neglected, Biblical truths in our time. Come be a
part of this awakening to Christian responsibility! If you are curious, or
undecided concerning these truths, we welcome you in attendance.

If you are in the full-time ministry (pastor, evangelist, missionary,
etc.), and you believe the views of, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" (or
similar views), please contact me at: pastor@kingdombaptist.org for the
possibility of speaking at this next (or future) conferences.

INTRODUCTION

For those of you who are not familiar with the Grace Evangelical Society
(G.E.S.), or Larry Vance, I will provide this brief introduction. The
stated purpose of G.E.S. is to, "promote the clear proclamation of God's
free salvation through faith alone in Christ alone, which is properly
correlated with and distinguished from issues related to discipleship."
This organization is to be commended for placing a salty roadblock in the
way of the modern movement to "Romanize the Gospel" into salvation through
WORKS (i.e. confusing positional salvation with discipleship, the gift
with the prize, etc.). They have an annual conference that is held in
Dallas-Fort Worth. Their journal is edited by Bob Wilkin (a bright, kind
brother). Some of the members of G.E.S. advocate the basic teachings
presented in my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" They believe in
exclusion from the Millennial Kingdom for unrepentant believers, the
possibility of physical chastisement at the Judgment Seat, and even
temporary "Gehenna" (i.e. Hell) for some believers. Most of the members,
while shying away from the above views, would nevertheless still apply the
warnings in Hebrews, and the "outer darkness" of Matthew 25:30, to TRUE
BELIEVERS. Yet, they hold to the view that these warnings (since they are
in the midst of parables or figurative language) are only figurative in
nature (a view, however, that is refuted by simply noticing the many
LITERAL warnings already fulfilled in Scripture that are, nevertheless,
also couched in parabolic language). The rest of these members would hold
that ALL believers gain entrance into the Millennial Kingdom, and that the
above warnings refer only to the "emotional" suffering of shame (or
perhaps being barred from the banquet table). This is the view of Zane
Hodges and Bob Wilkin (the editor of the G.E.S. Journal, who on most
issues follows the teachings of Hodges).

Larry M. Vance teaches at Pensacola Bible Institute in Florida (he is
associated with Peter Ruckman). He is the author of the mammoth (788 page)
work, "The Other Side of Calvinism" (1991, 1999). This book is referenced
many times by Dave Hunt in his new book, "What Love Is This?". Vance's
review of my book is one of the few reviews that actually give some
evidence that the reviewer has read more than the bold print at the start
of each chapter (there is a fleshly tendency in man to naturally shun the
light of true accountability).

Vance agrees with G.E.S. on the freeness of the Gospel (against the
Reformed Calvinist's "Lordship salvation"). However, his interpretation of
many of the warning passages is radically different from the members of
G.E.S.

VANCE'S REVIEW

I am in full agreement with the first four paragraph's of Vance's review
of my book. It is simply descriptive information. In the fifth paragraph,
there are some statements that might be confusing to some readers. Vance
writes:

"The second part of the book is a lengthy chapter on 'Objections and
Questions Answered.' But in addition to answering what he perceives as
potential objections, Faust introduces other details of his
'accountability' system: Some Christians in 1 Thessalonians 4 will not
always be with the Lord (pp.249-56)..."

First, as Vance notes earlier, I hold that every true believer (regardless
of his or her status during the Millennial Age) will always be with the
Lord throughout eternity. However, I do show that the wording of 1
Thessalonians 4:17 (in comparison to other Scriptures) need not imply that
"every" believer (regardless of whether he is as steadfast as the
Thessalonians) will spend the Millennium with Jesus. Thus far, Vance does
not mention any of the Biblical grounds for my various assertions, nor
does he offer any arguments in refutation.

It is in his sixth paragraph that Vance makes his first negative
statement. He writes:

"The third part of the book consists of three chapters (totaling almost
100 pages) containing quotes from men like George Peters, Robert Govett,
J.R. Graves, G.H. Pember, Oswald J. Smith, Robert Ketcham, William H.
Griffith Thomas, Philip Mauro, I.M. Haldeman, Hudson Taylor, J.A. Seiss,
Watchman Nee, Robert Neighbour, D.M. Panton, and assorted Church Fathers
on 'accountability truth in history.' No evidence is presented that any of
these men taught EXACTLY what Faust believes..."

First of all, this statement is meaningless, since there are hardly two
Christians in history that can be found to agree in every jot and tittle
of every subject. Yet, the majority of these Christians listed in my book
(with biographical information and lengthy excerpts from their own
writings) did teach exactly what I STATED that they taught at the head of
the list: "A Sample of Premillennialists Who Believed in Kingdom Exclusion
and/or Corporal Chastisement at the Judgment Seat of Christ." Therefore,
popular premillennialists such as Robert Govett, D.M. Panton, G.H. Pember,
S.S. Craig, H.W. Fry, Watchman Nee, A.G. Tilney, Col. Poynder, etc.
believed in Millennial exclusion, physical chastisement, AND temporary
banishment to the underworld (to be restored on the Last Day at the Great
White Throne). To argue that this is not EXACTLY what is taught in my book
is to appear dishonest. Then, there are popular Baptist leaders like R.E.
Neighbour, Robert Ketcham, I.M. Haldeman, and scores of others, who
certainly taught physical chastisement at the Judgment Seat, as well as an
undefined Millennial exclusion. I base my teachings strictly on the King
James Bible text; therefore, I sometimes differ from these early scholars
on some minor details. But to make the claim that these writers do not
"exactly" agree with me, appears to be obfuscation. It gives the
impression that I am trying to "pull a fast one." And this often works,
since this age of Christians rarely reads (and when many do, it is often a
work of fiction, NOT a detailed study of theology or eschatology).

To his credit (unlike others who have tried to use this straw man), Vance
adds:

"...but there is no question that many of them did teach SOME of what
Faust believes."

Amen to that! But why not define the "SOME" (e.g. chastisement at the
Judgment Seat, Millennial exclusion, weeping and gnashing of teeth, outer
darkness, restoration after the Millennium, etc.)? I can understand this
need to obscure the history I have brought to light. I have had Christian
history students (and even professors) tell me in bewilderment that they
did not know that many of these men taught these views (for a quick
example, see Van Impe's video on my book). This is why I make the claim
that there has been a BURIAL of older, premillennial prophetic material.
Men like Pember and Peters are praised, yet their works are not offered in
school bookstores or libraries (though they have been back in print for
years). Next, Vance writes:

"Of course, many other premillennial writers could be cited to the
contrary, and all amillennialists and postmillennialists could gather
their own quotations in support of their position."

Vance misses the whole point here.  I plainly show in my book WHY I am
listing the history (how could he miss it?). I write:

"...no one should be found committing the logical fallacy of an ad populum
argument. The Holy Bible is the final authority. Needless to say, the
doctrine of selective-resurrection [into the Millennium] WILL HARDLY EVER
GET A FAIR HEARING FROM SCRIPTURE ALONE IF MODERN OPPONENTS OF THE VIEW,
EITHER DECEITFULLY OR IGNORANTLY, CONTINUE TO OBSCURE THE TESTIMONIES OF
ITS CHIEF DEFENDERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CLAIMING THE VIEW HAS NEVER
BEEN POPULAR. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT EVERY CHRISTIAN SHOULD BE
PROPERLY INFORMED CONCERNING THE PREVALENCE OF THE DOCTRINE...THAT ALL MAY
INDEED JUDGE FREELY FROM SCRIPTURE CONCERNING ITS VALIDITY." (pp.301-2)

Years before (and during) the writing of my book, I dealt with hundreds of
Baptists and premillennialists around the world who responded to the views
(later presented in my book) on our church website. The NUMBER ONE
objection was: "If this is true, THEN WHY HAVEN'T OTHER CHRISTIANS SEEN
THESE TRUTHS BEFORE NOW?" This number one objection is therefore dealt
with, and FULLY dismantled at the latter end of my book. Vance argues that
other premillennialists can also provide a list of historic Christians who
share their views. I state the same thing in my book! But the difference
between my list of Christians, and a list by other premillennialists, is
that NO ONE DOUBTS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHRISTIANS IN HISTORY THAT HAVE
TAUGHT STANDARD SCOFIELDISM (i.e. no chastisement at the Judgment Seat for
any Christian). However, based on years of experience teaching these
truths on the Internet, on the street, and at church, I know that this is
the FIRST argument made about Kingdom exclusion once the weight of the
Scriptures begins to press upon the mind: "But who has ever taught such a
thing?"

Furthermore (and Vance omits any mention of this), I show in my book that,
at times, earlier premillennialists (especially the futurists) who shared
the views of my book were more prevalent than the others! But all this has
been reversed today. THIS FACT appears practically UNKNOWN by the majority
of modern prophetic teachers and students. When these things are properly
understood (as demonstrated in my book), the objections concerning history
and "fruit" are cleared away. These doctrines of accountability, presented
in my book, have already brought forth fruit in history. Reviewers and
critics love to camp against my historical section; however, if I would
have left out the material, almost every one of them would have made the
alleged "obscurity" of the doctrine one of their main objections! The
proof of this is that, even in the face of my documentation, reviewers
STILL have made this objection, neglecting to read this part of my book!
Readers of past critiques and reviews will remember those writers who
wrote something to the effect of, "Pember or Nee never taught anything
like this!" When they said this, they exposed themselves to be ignorant
of, not only the works of men like Pember and Nee, but of the TABLE OF
CONTENTS of my book - the book they were supposed to be "reviewing" for
their readers! The fact is, many Bible teachers are appearing either
ignorant or dishonest by the open presentation of this material in my
historical section. The truth of the matter is that MOST OF THEM did not
know that these men believed these things. They had heard of some modern
folks teaching that outer darkness in Matthew 25:30 could apply to some
unfaithful Christians. But they dismissed this teaching as something new
and nutty. They had absolutely no idea that so many of the great men they
have been quoting for years actually believed these things. Also, most of
them had never heard of men like Robert Govett, etc., even though in their
own day, they were esteemed as the foremost premillennial interpreters.
And many would obviously like this historical material to remain exactly
where it was before my book revived it - buried in the old books!

Let us now deal with Vance's seventh paragraph. He writes:

"The most objectionable thing about Faust's 'accountability truth' is that
'every Christian must therefore come into contact with the fire that
issues out before the Lord's throne'..."

I can understand why such a thing might be "objectionable" to this modern,
"TV Guide" generation. It is generation that is almost wholly ignorant of
the Scriptures. It forms its views based upon fickle, flimsy whims and
feelings. But I cannot help but wonder why this is so "objectionable" to a
King James Bible believer. In the Old Testament, the FIRE OF GOD did not
just fall on SODOM, it also fell on God's PEOPLE:

Leviticus 10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered
strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
2 And there went out FIRE FROM THE LORD, and devoured them, and they died
before the LORD.

Numbers 11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the FIRE OF THE LORD
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of
the camp.
2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD,
the fire was quenched.

Numbers 16:35 And there came out a FIRE FROM THE LORD, and consumed the
two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

With these very Scriptures revealing the "terror of the Lord" before us,
we then have the Holy Ghost warning New Testament saints that we better
not forget them!:

1 Corinthians 10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and
were destroyed of the destroyer.
11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

New Testament Christians are warned that God is STILL a consuming fire:

Hebrews 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let
us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear:
29 For OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE.

Is God (who slew Ananias and Sapphira, in Acts 5), and MANY of the
Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:30) somehow forbidden to slay His people by
fire in this age, if He so desires?:

Luke 12:4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he
hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

It must be admitted by every professing Bible believer that God can still
drop His fir eon any saint if He so pleases. And if it be admitted that He
can slay any Christian by HIS FIRE, in this life (in this age of His
patience), where is the Scripture that states that He cannot slay
unfaithful Christians by this same fire BEFORE HIS THRONE OF JUDGMENT, on
the day of reward according to works? Knowing the TERROR of the Lord, we
persuade men (2 Corinthians 5:9-11, Revelation 2:11)!

Vance continues:

"He bases this on a misinterpretation of 'the fire shall try every man's
work of what sort it is' (1 Cor 3:13)..."

Vance does not attempt to counter the arguments I provided for my view.
For example, one argument offered is that in regard to Biblical warning
passages, even if they are framed in parabolic or symbolic language, they
are LITERAL in their main threat (to believers or unbelievers). For
example, in Matthew 13, Jesus gives the Parable of the Tares. It is
obviously a PARABLE.. But would Vance maintain that the Tares being
"burned" represents only a symbolic burning? Is not the burning LITERAL
when Jesus gives the interpretation of the parable? This argument is
developed in my book in detail. Furthermore, Vance does not deal with 1
Corinthians 3:16-17, which is Paul's CONCLUSION, and therefore, his
interpretation of the figures:

1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
dwelleth in you?
17 If any man defile the temple of God, HIM SHALL GOD DESTROY; for the
temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

He can "say" that the destruction is in this age only, and not at the
Judgment Seat. But the CONTEXT refutes him. All admit that verse 15 refers
to the Judgment Seat of Christ. But if we are to believe that verses 16
and 17 only apply to this life (in spite of the context), what would this
do to Revelation 20 and the judgment of the wicked at the Great White
Throne? The Bible teaches that they are judged according to their works,
and then verse 15 reads:

Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life
was cast into the lake of fire.

Do not these people go into the Lake of Fire at the Great White Throne,
after their resurrection? But if we are to interpret the Bible the same
way many interpret the warnings to Christians, then we would have to argue
that verse 15 (in Revelation 20) is a sudden change of context, and that
it only refers to a temporal judgment in this life! I do not believe this
for a minute. The context of verse 15 is the final judgment day. And, in
the same manner, the context of verse 17 (in 1 Corinthians 3) is the
Judgment Seat of Christ for Christians, before the Millennial Kingdom is
established.

Vance writes:

"...Faust has the fire trying the Christian himself..."

And what does 1 Corinthians 3:15 say?:

1 Corinthians 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
loss: but HE HIMSELF shall be saved; yet so as BY FIRE.

Furthermore, Vance's statement that, "He bases this on a misinterpretation
of...I Cor 3:13...", implies that this Scripture is the only proof-text in
my 454 page book. In fact, it is only the icing on a full cake of
proof-texts.

Vance obviously believes that because the Bible says that a man's WORKS
will be tried, that this means that the MAN who did the works, will not
suffer the chastisement. Let us test this theory with the Scriptures in
Revelation 20:

Revelation 20:12 ...and the dead were judged out of those things which
were written in the books, ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS.

Vance certainly believes that the wicked at the Great White Throne are
judged "according to their WORKS." Yet, this does not grant them immunity
from suffering eternally in fire. They will not find on that great day,
any grounds to say, "But You only warned us about our WORKS being judged,
not our BODIES!"

Also, although Vance speaks briefly of "...every Christian receiving 'the
things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be
good or bad, (2 Cor 5:10)...", he doesn't even offer a hint of what he
thinks it means to RECEIVE for the BAD. It is sometimes rumored that he
and Ruckman believe in the possibility of some sort of STRIPES for some
Christians at the Judgment Seat (Luke 12:47). Is his disagreement with my
book simply that I say the STRIPES can be administered by FIRE, and he
sees them administered some other way? If so, let him come out in the open
and say so.

There are some things that seem a bit inconsistent to me. Brethren often
preach themselves red about how Jesus can "slay the Christian" and "take
him to the woodshed." But we are to believe that when Jesus appears, on
the DAY OF JUDGMENT, that He has to suddenly tie His HANDS behind His
back!:

Hebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me,
I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge HIS
PEOPLE.
31 It is a fearful thing to fall INTO THE HANDS of the living God.

As long as He is INVISIBLE, we to believe that He can SLAY unfaithful
Christians; but  when He ever APPEARS, are we to then believe that He
cannot touch a single hair on their heads? Doesn't this sound a bit
strange? I challenge every reader to search the Scriptures, and see if it
is true that Jesus will suddenly tie His hands behind His back at the
Judgment Seat of Christ! Whatever severity of discipline that Jesus can
administer in this age of patience, He may certainly administer on the day
when He finally comes to reckon with His people.

Next, Vance writes:

"In reply to the charge that this teaching sounds like purgatory, Faust
responds that the 'Biblical truths of millennial exclusion and millennial
chastisement were perverted into Rome's monstrous Purgatory' (p.90)."

This is all Vance writes on this subject (he is obviously short on space).
I am glad that he gives one of the arguments of the book here. I have a
whole chapter on this objection. Rome teaches that temporary suffering is
only for those who have worked their way to eternal salvation by avoiding
big sins. The temporary punishment in the mythological Purgatory is a
final suffering added to their former works, to earn ultimate salvation.
My book (and the former Christians it quotes) believe in salvation by
grace through faith alone. There is no work (past, present or future)
whereby a person can earn eternal salvation. The "work" is provided by the
Blood of Jesus on the Cross. Any chastisement at the Judgment Seat, or
during the Millennial age, cannot add a single ounce to our eternal
security. This is why the foremost writers on Kingdom exclusion for
unfaithful Christians, have been the foremost writers against Rome
(Govett, Pember, Panton, Fry, Nee, etc.). We would rather be accused of
having a Judgment Seat of Christ that resembles Purgatory, than to have a
salvation gospel the same as the pope's "gospel." And, as we shall see, if
you do not apply many of these Biblical warnings to believers during the
Millennium, you will have no other recourse but to teach some form of
ETERNAL SALVATION BY WORKS (to the delight of Rome). This eternal
salvation by works may come in the form of Romanism, Arminianism
(backloading), Hyper-Calvinism (front-loading), or even
Hyper-Dispensationalism. But regardless of the form it takes, scores of
passages in the Bible must be interpreted in a manner that obscures the
true Gospel, and brings forth the prophesied revival of Rome (Revelation
17).

This brings us to the next statement by brother Vance:

"To disagree with how he applies certain Scriptures, is to be labeled a
Bullingerite or hyper-dispensationalist (pp.76, 266)."

Now, this certainly is not true. I only label people BULLINGERITES who
teach WHAT BULLINGER TAUGHT about the Book of Revelation. Bullinger taught
that the Lord's words to the Seven Churches did not apply doctrinally to
seven literal churches in the first century. He taught that all of these
"churches" are TRIBULATIONAL. Bullinger (known as the originator of
hyper-dispensationalism) also taught that the majority of the New
Testament did not apply doctrinally to Christians in this age. Vance (and
Ruckman) teach that the MAJORITY OF HUMANS have been (or will be) SAVED BY
A MIXTURE OF FAITH AND WORKS. They teach that only Christians in this age
(beginning somewhere in Acts, to the pretribulational Rapture) are saved
by grace through faith alone. The mass of humanity (billions) in the Old
Testament (and some of the New Testament), people in the Tribulation
Period, and people in the Millennium, are all (according to Vance and
Ruckman) saved by faith and works (and this salvation can be lost).

This teaching uses much of Bullinger's system (without denying water
baptism for this age). However, it goes beyond it in other respects.
Ruckman (and Vance) are not the first to hold that people in the majority
of dispensations in the Bible are saved by grace through works (this has
been Rome's view for centuries). But they are the first to teach this
view, while at the same time holding that people IN THIS AGE ONLY are
saved by grace through faith alone.

My refutation of Bullingerism is found in my book. I demonstrate how his
views lead to antinomianism (no accountability for sin; not even a loss of
a crown, etc.). It is a travesty of interpretation to claim that every
inspired word written to first century churches does not doctrinally apply
to these same churches, but to others in the future. Whatever one attempts
to do with the warnings to the Seven Churches, or the warnings in Hebrews,
it is folly to claim that the warnings do not apply to the people in the
first century to whom they were addressed. Prophetic interpretations do
not override the literal, doctrinal application of warnings and promises
to the people to whom they are written.

In the eighth paragraph, Vance writes:

"Just what does a Christian have to do in order to not be raised with a
body sufficient to abide the fire of the Judgment Seat of Christ? Faust
responds: practice 'disobedience and sloth' (p. 143), 'practice rebellion
and unfaithfulness' (p. 215)..."

We may easily turn this question around on brother Vance. He believes that
if a Christian does not "suffer" with Christ, he will not reign with
Christ (2 Timothy 2:12). Therefore, Vance believes that REIGNING with
Christ is conditioned upon SUFFERING (for example, see Vance's, "The Other
Side of Calvinism," p.589). The difference between our views is that I do
not believe that non-reigning Christians will ENTER the Kingdom at all.
The so-called "street-sweepers" in the Millennium will come from the
mortal nations that populate the Kingdom (not from saints from this age).
Everyone who enters the Kingdom from this age will REIGN (carefully check
the following verses: Revelation 17:14, 5:10, 20:4,6). Yet, Vance believes
that some saints will not reign with Christ. But he obviously does not see
that his question can be equally applied to his own view. Just what does a
Christian have to do in order to not be raised TO REIGN with Christ? How
many sins will cause him to forfeit the reign? What sins, and to what
degree, will cause the Christian to forfeit his Millennial reign? But
alas, Vance never tells us what a sin of this nature consists of. If he
does tell us exactly what sins will cause a Christian to forfeit his reign
with Christ, then Vance will have found his answer to his question! The
only difference between us is that he believes the non-reigning Christian
somehow remains in the Kingdom, and I believe that he goes to prison, and
misses the Kingdom. Vance himself has written that our views are very
close in some respects. Therefore, this last "objection" in paragraph
eight is no objection at all. Even those who see on the possible loss of a
few jewels on a crown, according to Vance, must be able to tell us exactly
where the line is for losing these jewels. The point is, the Bible teaches
that we are to only have "confidence" (based on fighting the good fight,
etc.) of gaining the Millennial prize. We are not to judge ourselves
worthy before the time, or presumptuously think we stand (1 Corinthians
4:3,4; 10:12, etc.). The sins that will disbar us from reigning are listed
in 1 Corinthians 6, Galatians 5, and Ephesians 5.

In paragraph ten, Vance writes:

"In addition to these problems, 'The Rod: Will God Spare It?' suffers from
too many assumptions..."

Vance only asserts this point. He does not overcome any of the proofs
offered for the minor points that he raises. Furthermore, most of these
so-called assumptions do not greatly affect the major premises of the book
(my belief that Paul wrote Hebrews, etc.).

Vance begins to nitpick in his eleventh paragraph what he calls "minor"
notes. For example, he doesn't like the fact that Scripture references are
fully spelled out. His implication appears to be that I wanted to make the
book seem longer than it really is. When in reality, we are living in an
age when many people are so ignorant of Scripture, I WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD
NOT UNDERSTAND THE ABBREVIATIONS! And I put a space between paragraphs for
the same reason. I wrote my book to hopefully be READ by as many as
possible in this generation, when reading is a rare habit.

And if Vance will waste space calling attention to such "minor notes,"
perhaps he should take a look at his own writings. My book is 454 pages.
Yet, in barely 4 pages, Vance makes the following mistake:

"...'The Rod'...suffers from too many assumptions....to walk in the flesh
means to suffer for Christ (p. 73)..."

Where in the world do I teach the blasphemous statement that "walking in
the flesh" is the same as "suffering for Christ"? I do, however, on page
73, write:

"To walk in the flesh is to REFUSE to suffer for Christ."

Therefore, we will assume that Vance's words contain a typographical error
by Vance, or the editor. But we will refrain from further nitpicking.

In Vance's twelfth paragraph, he writes:

"One other teaching of Faust that is strangely omitted from the book
(except for a veiled reference in the glossary...) is the doctrine of the
selective rapture....Faust apparently believed that this teaching would
unnecessarily turn people away from 'accountability truth.'"

No, I hold that the selective (pre-trib) rapture is a part of
accountability truth. But my book concentrates on KINGDOM exclusion (not
pre-trib rapture exclusion). Ironically, similarly, the number one
objection made to the selective rapture is that it is an obscure teaching
(without many adherents in history). This objection is absolutely
laughable. There are so many great Christians that believed in a selective
pre-trib rapture that I would have had to almost double the book (e.g. men
like early Baptist writer J.R. Graves, George N.H. Peters, G.H. Pember,
John Wilkinson, Hudson Taylor, to name a few). But I decided that the
subjects should remain distinct (since there are some people Bible
teachers who hold to kingdom exclusion, who nevertheless do not believe in
a selective  rapture).

But if we are to point out so-called "veiled references," we might call
attention to the fact that in his 788 page book against Calvinism, Vance
barely mentions the fact that he believes that the majority of humanity
has been saved by faith AND WORKS. And when this doctrine of his is
implied in his book, there is no elaboration. Vance apparently believed
that this teaching would unnecessarily turn people away from his views
against Calvinism.

Vance's thirteenth paragraph (watch out for the number thirteen),
concludes by saying:

"Aside from calling attention to the serious nature of the Judgment Seat
of Christ, the book is at best a curiosity."

And what, may we ask, does Vance find so "serious" about the Judgment Seat
of Christ? He never tells us. Vance continues:

"It is recycled Pember, Lang, Govett, and Panton with some additional
twists that will further drive people away from real 'accountability
truth.' By inventing a Protestant Purgatory, it is Faust who holds
defective views on accountability truth."

If my book is recycled Pember, Lang, Govett, and Panton (not to mention
R.E. Neighbour, R.T. Ketcham, Watchman Nee, H.W. Fry, A.J. Tilney, W.F.
Roadhouse, S.S. Craig, Edwin Wilson, W.P.Clark, Philip Mauro, G. F.
Poynder, A.T. Schofield, Joseph Sladen, William Burgh, and scores of
others!), then how is it that I am inventing a Protestant Purgatory? How
can I be supposedly "recycling" something, and "inventing" something at
the same time? Furthermore, Vance obviously believes that by calling the
teaching a name ("Protestant Purgatory") he has refuted it. I could easily
call his brand of dispensationalism "Bullinger on LSD." I do not know how
anyone can teach that the majority of people who have ever lived (minus
the last two-thousand years) have been saved by faith and works (and that
this salvation can be lost). Furthermore, I would take a Protestant
"Purgatory" any day, over a "Roman Catholic gospel" (which is no gospel).
And if the warnings do not refer to the Millennium, they MUST refer to
eternity (and thus eternal salvation by works). The amazing thing is that
Vance would agree with this statement. He simply believes that the
warnings in Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 10 (etc.) apply to the future
Tribulation Period. This is how he gets around the Pauline Epistles.  The
problem, however, is that there has NEVER been a time when ANY MAN could
be eternally saved by faith and works. And it is impossible to apply the
warnings in Hebrews to people in the future, and not have them equally
apply to the people to whom they are addressed in the first century!

Vance writes:

"Believers are accountable, but secure now and forever."

Yet, Vance does not believe that ANY BLOOD-BOUGHT BELIEVER will be SECURE
in the Tribulation Period. I also believe that believers are accountable,
"but secure now and forever." But Vance believes that this present
security cannot exempt any believer from being slain by God. He believes 1
Corinthians 11:30. Yet, if being SLAIN in this life, in the day of God's
patience, does not contradict SECURITY, then why would being temporarily
chastised at the Judgment Seat, in the day of reward according to works,
contradict SECURITY?

Vance's review makes too many UNSUPPORTED accusations. It does avoid the
bombastic tirades of many detractors. It is Vance that has assumed that
the warnings in the Pauline Epistles are DIFFERENT than the warnings to
believers in Matthew, Hebrews, Jude, Revelation, etc.

THE BLESSINGS OF FEASTS OF CHARITY
*****************************************
Luke 14:12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy
kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a
recompence be made thee.
13 But WHEN THOU MAKEST A FEAST, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the
blind:
14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou
shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

I have been motivated in the past by some testimonies of preachers I have
heard. There is a dear brother named Wiley Drake in California that allows
the homeless to sleep at his church. The city is not happy, because his
church is on the way to Disney Land, and they want everyone to have a
"good view" as they drive. Another brother, W.N. Otwell, used to actually
have his church-service every Sunday in downtown Ft. Worth, and feed the
homeless (the city actually began to harass him). The founding fathers of
our country would be shocked if they could see that practically every form
of Christian charity in our day (taking care of orphans, taking care of
troubled children, church schools, feeding the poor, etc.) is regulated,
and requires a "license" (i.e. permission!). Where will it all end? Will
we have to get a license to be a parent? To hold an assembly?

I would like to share a ministry with you that has been a great success,
and so far, a great blessing. Perhaps it will encourage you. As so many
are growing increasingly hardened to sound doctrine (we see it on the
streets every week), there is no better time in history to turn the weight
of our focus towards the homeless, the prisoners, etc. In this age when
"bridge building" has been perverted into outright sin (i.e. attracting a
crowd by "rock" music, etc.), it is good to know that there are still some
old-fashioned, holy, "good works" that will also serve as bridge-builders
to sinners. There is no guarantee that everyone you feed physically, will
eat "spiritually." But SOME will hear the Word, and be saved! Notice the
following Bible verses:

Jude 1:12 These are spots in your FEASTS OF CHARITY, when they feast with
you, feeding themselves without fear...

Luke 14:21 ...Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet
there is room.
23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall
taste of my supper.

Luke 7:22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John
what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to THE POOR
THE GOSPEL IS PREACHED.

John 6:26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye
seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but BECAUSE YE DID EAT OF THE
LOAVES, AND WERE FILLED.
27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you:
for him hath God the Father sealed.

While our church, at times, has been blessed to minister to the poor,
homeless, etc., we decided to try something a bit different. Why not bring
the homeless to us, and eat with them, and interact with them? (Proverbs
9:2-5, Mark 6:37, Isaiah 55:1) Would they come? Would they fill up our
church building if invited to come? We decided to pass out flyers in the
city of Fort Worth, saying that we would bring our church bus to pick
people up at a certain time, and take them to eat a warm meal (at our
church). We did not know what to expect, but we were hoping in the Lord
that He would bless our vision. How wonderful it was when we pulled up
downtown to see the crowds of homeless people waiting for us! They filled
the whole bus up within minutes (a large bus). They were very friendly.
Many church members had prepared a nice meal, and many had donated coats,
scarves, Bibles, etc. How wonderful it was to look out into a full
congregation of these people! We sang some familiar songs ("Amazing
Grace"), and then I preached a short message on the free gift of eternal
life (I also preached the message of Kingdom-accountability to any who
might be already saved). I was shocked at the great response. After the
meal, the handshakes, the appreciative eyes and words, and the testimonies
of how these folks got on the street, were all very moving. Some even
requested more preaching.

God causes His gracious sun to shine on the just, and the UNJUST. I am not
worthy of God's love and grace. No one is worthy of God's free gift of
salvation, and His longsuffering toward man. The day of reckoning
according to works is fast approaching. But this is the day of God's grace
and patience. Jesus preached to sinners, and fed them (even though they
were not worthy of it). We do not give them money to buy alcohol. But we
can be responsible and careful, while still showing forth the goodness of
Christ. We plan to do this ministry once a month, for now. Please pray for
it!

        <h1>WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH: WHO IS BUYING THE SCAM?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Once again, now that leftist liberals are screaming to ban free-speech in the light of the Arizona shooting tragedy, we see the Westboro Baptist Church getting plenty of free media coverage. They are supposedly trying to protest the little girlâ€™s funeral who was shot, because she is Catholic. I believe the whole church is a scam set up by these same Lefty Liberals. The alleged â€œpastorâ€ was previously a civil rights lawyer, who has had some connections with Al Gore. It is obvious that this whole thing is fake. It is being used to bring peopleâ€™s emotions to the height of rage, so they will cry out for a law against free speech and religious liberty. The proper response is to expose the game.
Fundamental Christians do believe it is proper to speak against homosexuality and even Catholicism. But this alleged Baptist church does things to enrage even the conservatives in America. It is past time to expose this puppet show. Where is the Gospel preached by this alleged church? Who is funding all of these trips and protests around the world?

Fighting Depression with a Thankful Heart

"Here you go Sweetheart," I once said to one of my daughters as I handed her a handful of her favorite treats. "But Mommy, I want a whole LOT of them!" she answered. "This is enough for now," I replied. "Be thankful for these, and maybe another time you can have some more." For a few minutes there (until she began to eat them) my little daughter had a difficult time being thankful for the wonderful treats she had, because she kept her little eyes on the entire bag of "so many." Looking at my small handful at that moment was just not enough, when, in her mind she could have so much more.

Many times we act the same way towards the Lord's handful of blessings. Sometimes I have kept my eyes on all that I could have and all I wanted, instead of what I did have. It doesn't take long before my heart begins to despise, as my daughter did, the bounty that the Lord has already blessed me with.

Discontentment starts with our thoughts. Women look at their houses and think how much they need or want a bigger one, how they would like new clothes, furniture, a new car, more money, etc. Those thoughts in themselves, or at least the start of the thought, may not cause discontent. There may be a true need for these things! But is it practical at this moment to get these things? Maybe not. If it isn't, then further thinking will be counterproductive.

If you are adding to your family a new baby and will need a new car to fit everyone in, then it is very practical to plan to get a new car before the baby comes. But, if you just don't like the style or color of your old car, and want a new one, it is definitely not a necessity to replace it. You have to make sure that you distinguish between what is needed (Oh, Lord, please help us to get a new car that RUNS!), and what is wanted (Wow, I saw the new model car and HAVE to have it!). When you continually allow yourself to think of all the things you would like to have, you are putting yourself in danger of discontentment, and of course covetousness.

Becoming depressed bears the same concept. Depression begins with discontentment with what you have, who you are married to, where you live, etc. We must fight depression the same way that it came: with our thoughts. Do not allow yourself to fall into a self-pitying mind-frame. When you begin to allow thoughts that tear down the blessings that you have, you must cast them down. The enemy wants you to live a life of depression rather than victory and joy in the Holy Spirit. What is it going to benefit you to continually mull over your husband's faults? Is it going to bless your life in any way to be upset that you don't have as much money to spend as "so and so" does? Are you going to be any happier roving the malls and furniture stores looking at all of the things you can't afford to buy? If we want to beat depression, we must fight it at the root.

We are so blessed in this age. We have closets full of clothes and think, "I just don't have ANYTHING to wear!" We have so much stuff that we have to have garages, storage-sheds and a multitude of closets to put all of that stuff in, and yet we still want to buy more. Obviously, things aren't going to make anyone happy for very long. The only way to happiness is a close relationship with Jesus. To know Him is to know the fulfillment of your heart's desires IF you will allow yourself to be content with His will for you.

Contentment all starts with thankfulness to the Lord for what He has given you. A thankful heart is something the Lord loves to see in His people. God has promised to give us such things as we need. We should show Him that we are content with His gifts. Though we may need a bigger house, we must thank Him for having a place to live, and pray for His provision for us in the future.

How beautiful it must be to the Lord to look at His people and see them walking in thankfulness! To see them glorifying and praising Him for every little thing! To see them living their lives without covetousness and envy! It really is possible to give our desires over to the Lord. We can give Him full control of the things we want and need, just by turning it over to Him in prayer, and then trusting His goodness to provide those things when we need them. The Lord is so giving. A few weeks ago, I thought about something that I wanted. I didn't even pray about it. Later that day there was a knock at my door, and a friend brought me as a gift the very thing I was wanting! Isn't the Lord amazing? To hear such a little thing as my thoughts, and show me His desire to shower His beloved with blessings!

When your heart is full of thankfulness, there is no room for depression. When your heart constantly sings the praises of God, there is no room for discontentment. Thankfulness breeds a joyful heart. Looking at all that you "lack" will only bring you into bitterness. Practice thankfulness, by siting before the Lord and thanking Him for everything you can in your life. Then begin to make it a habit to praise Him for the little blessings in life as well as the big ones: a good parking spot, an item on sale, a good word from a friend, protection while driving, safety for your child. Little by little, your heart will begin to take on the joyful fruits of thankfulness.

The Housewife

There was a housewife I once knew

Who had so much work that she wanted to do.

She had eight loads of laundry to wash and to dry,

Five beds to make and groceries to buy.

Library books three years overdue,

She thought, "Go to the library? No, let's go to the zoo."

"Hurray!" cried her children. But, alas, they stayed home.

The eight loads of laundry had all the clothes that they owned.

She had dishes from dinner the night before

And gum to scrape off the kitchen floor.

And just as she knelt to scrape up the gum,

She thought about popcorn and she wanted some.

So she got out the popper; it was full of rice.

And she thought to herself, "It would be nice

To get out the pictures of my wedding dress,"

But she couldn't find them because of the mess

In her living room where she kept a shelf

Full of books on how to improve herself.

So she picked out a book and she sat and she read.

And she thought to herself, "I'll take a nap instead."

So she stretched and she yawned and flopped into bed.

Then she remembered something her husband had said,

So she got out the iron and she looked for his shirt

Which had fallen into a pile of dirt

She had swept in a corner a few days before

And had stopped because someone had knocked at the door.

Then she sighed, "Oh dear!" and she moaned, "Poor me!"

And she grabbed a sack of taco chips and turned on the TV.

And she watched all the game shows.

And she watched Love of Life

And she dreamed of becoming the perfect wife!

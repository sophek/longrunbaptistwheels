        <h1>HARRY POTTER, THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS AND THE PROPHESIED REVIVAL OF SORCERY</h1>

            <blockquote>"Educator Calls for Warning Stickers on 'Harry Potter' Books - Not everyone is under the spell of that phenomenon, 'Harry Potter'. The Rev. Robert Frisken, the head of Christian Community Schools Ltd. and heading a coalition of nearly 100 Christian schools in Australia, is about to write parents, cautioning them about the books. He does not want the stories about the trainee wizard banned, but suggests the books should carry warning stickers before they are placed in school libraries. 'The ordinary person is typified as being bad because they have no (magic) powers, and heroes are the people who are using the occult. Good finds itself in the occult...'...The four Harry Potter books have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and remain near the top of international bestseller lists three years after the first one appeared. But the books have become a controversial addition to classrooms in America - figures show they were the most challenged books of 1999. Efforts to restrict their use, or remove them from classrooms and school libraries were reported in 19 states...." (Religion Today, March 27, 2001)</blockquote>
This mass revival of sorcery has been predicted by the Bible. Do everything you can to warn people to avoid it. The fact that so many children are crazy about these books shows that the Devil is doing something. How else can it be explained? Many Christian leaders are unable to see how this is all playing into the hands of the future Antichrist. The world must be prepared so it will see sorcery and occultism in a "good" light. These children have wizards as their heroes. A generation is being prepared for the Antichrist in the Tribulation age:
<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders...</blockquote>
The Bible predicted that Christians would begin to read demonic books:
<blockquote>1 Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the LATTER TIMES some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</blockquote>
This refers to Positive Mental Attitude books (i.e. "white" witchcraft), various forms of psycho-babble etc., as well as books written to seduce the minds of children. The above verse speaks of true CHRISTIANS falling away into this garbage. Who are they? They include the sweet Christian mothers and grandmothers who could not wait to buy their children the next Harry Potter book because they heard about it on TV.

Objection: "You sound like the people who burned witches in Salem!"

Really? If the minister in Salem had watched over his children and not let them play occult games (i.e. necromancy, palmistry, fortune telling, magic and "out of body experiences") with the slave nanny, his little girls and their friends would not have fallen down on the ground into convulsions! They would not have contorted their faces, spoken in MALE voices and murdered 19 of the most noble, holy town folk by accusing them of witchcraft! Therefore, the Salem Witch Trials were primarily caused by CHILDREN PLAYING GAMES WITH SORCERY [see Charles W. Upham's "Salem Witchcraft, With an Account of Salem Village and a History of Opinions on Witchcraft and Kindred Spirits"; 1867]. If this happened with just a few children, what diabolical horrors will be unleashed upon the world through THIRTY MILLION children pretending they are witches and wizards with occult powers, exploring witchcraft as if it is a game?

The entire Salem experience could have been avoided by obedience to the
NT:

1. Rev. Mr. Parris (minister of the church in Salem Village) should have witnessed to the lost souls in the West Indies instead of bringing them back as slaves to watch over the children. "Menstealing" is forbidden (1Tim.1:10). 2. They should have understood that the civil laws of the OT have been repealed. It is wrong to put people to death for religious beliefs such as "witchcraft". These Puritans should have listened to the Baptists (John.8:7, etc.). 3. Fathers (especially the town minister) should have personally watched over their children and protected them from occult games (Deut.6:7, Luke 11:7, 1Tim.3:5).

#3 still applies today and it is one of the main things wrong with this world. And if more Christian parents do not start protecting their children from ungodly influences, then you can get ready for #2 above. And again, it will be the "noble, holy folk" that will be persecuted, just like it has almost always been throughout history (i.e. the majority of "witches" Rome burned were believers like John Huss and the many Anabaptists).

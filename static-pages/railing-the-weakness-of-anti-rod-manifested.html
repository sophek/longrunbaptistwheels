        <h1> RAILING: THE WEAKNESS OF ANTI-ROD MANIFESTED</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Another argument that the view of my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" is true will be found in the type of responses of those who attempt to refute it.

Years ago, pastor T.T. Shields (1873-1955), an amillennialist from Canada, attempted to refute the teachings of the well-known British writer D.M. Panton. Notice his words: "It is sheer, unmitigated rubbish. We not only reject it, we repudiate it, and abhor it. In our view, anyone who could write thus, and equally those who believe it, need the services of a psychiatrist."

Bullinger came close to the same railing when he went up against Pember and others.

In this late day and age, the same fleshly responses are made to accountability teaching: "Anyone who does [i.e. believe this doctrine] is a PURE IDIOT, MORON, zilch upstairs, 00 I.Q!" (pastor Doug Sehorne) Sehorne does not believe the "kingdom of God" in Paul's epistles refers to the Millennium. We welcome discussion and holy disputation. Yet, this utter inability to control passions is an argument that either their position is weak, or they themselves are unable to defend it in the Spirit.

I have no hatred for Herb Evans. I continually remind my readers that we are like-minded on many issues. However, he has appointed himself to be the first general who leads the battle against kingdom exclusion and a temporary, fiery rod at the judgment seat for carnal Christians. Therefore, although I am saddened that he attempts to divide the brethren through calling this view "heresy" (worthy of disfellowship), I am more than ready to meet his arguments with Scripture. But, when I ready myself for the dispute, I find that Herb Evans is only interested in e-mail and random article debates, whereby he is able to duck points and arguments at will. When I pressed him to quit avoiding an answer, he responded that he was not in a debate and did not have to respond to someone he had disfellowshipped! Thus, he is free to boast himself in his objections without having to have their shallowness exposed. And what do we find in this barrage of e-mails from brother Evans? Do we find a great deal of substance? Do we find reasoned objections? No. Instead, we find PERSONAL ATTACKS. We find a constant attack on my motives, on my supposed intentions, etc. This often INTIMIDATES some brethren. Yet, many rightly see this as an obvious SIGN OF WEAKNESS in regard to his position. Herb Evans has been forced to embrace the idea that the warnings that Jesus Christ gave to Peter, John and His other disciples, on numerous occasions, do NOT apply to Christians today. Paul (a New Testament Christian) plainly reveals to us the rotten fruit that will result from such a teaching:

1 Timothy 6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, EVEN THE WORDS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, RAILINGS, EVIL SURMISINGS,
5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

Herb Evans is growing increasingly near fulfilling this passage of Scripture. By teaching that the words of our Lord Jesus (when addressed to John and Peter) do NOT apply to Christians today, brother Herb has removed himself (and his followers) from some holy commandments and warnings that would be used by the Holy Ghost to restrain certain workings of the flesh. The apostle Paul teaches that the rotten fruit of this system of interpretation will be, among other things, RAILING and EVIL SURMISINGS.

Webster (1828) defines "surmisings" as: "To suspect; to imagine without certain knowledge." Therefore, certain suspicions and character assassinations (with no certain evidence) are a sign of the flesh. Judging motives and railing are signs of the weakness in either a person's views, or in his ability to defend them. At first, before Herb's replies were countered with Scripture, he was unwilling to descend into evil surmisings. He wrote: "Now, your motives for such a doctrine are pure, and would be agreed on by both of us, but I think you are throwing the baby out with the bath water in this doctrine....Believe me, I am writing this letter to you as kindly as possible. I like you and much of what you post on Kingdom alert." (7-23-01)

Nevertheless, when his refutations were answered with Scripture, he responded with a multitude of evil surmisings against me, personally. Brother Herb (more than once!) has had to retract his accusations publicly when I took the time to expose his errors in fact. Yet, since he will not submit to a formal debate, I will let his surmisings alone, and let them argue against his own view. If brother Herb, or any man, is able to offer a reasoned defense against the views of my book in formal debate, I welcome the dispute. May the Lord open all our eyes in any area where we are mistaken. (6-4-02)

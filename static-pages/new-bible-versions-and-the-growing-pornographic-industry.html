        <h1>NEW BIBLE VERSIONS AND THE GROWING PORNOGRAPHIC INDUSTRY</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "News Corp. Heir Woos China With Show of Support - James Murdoch gives speech backing the Asian nation's handling of Falun Gong and criticizing the West's coverage...The elder Murdoch has long viewed China as a critical piece of his global agenda...Murdoch - whose family's $30-billion corporate empire includes Fox Television, the Dodgers, the New York Post and Star TV, Asia's largest satellite network - also said Hong Kong democracy advocates should accept the reality of life under a strong-willed 'absolutist' government....Murdoch did warn his Los Angeles audience that investing in China required a 'strong stomach.'..." " (March 23, 2001, Times Staff Writer)

What corporation is this that is turning a blind eye to the suffering and torture of Christians (and New Age cults like Falon Gong)? Who are these Murdocks? Answer: They are the owners and publishers of the N.I.V. and other new bible versions. [NOTE: Although the NIV copyright is held by the International Bible Society, Zondervan has exclusive publishing rights.] The Murdocks also make more money from PORNOGRAPHY than Hugh Hefner or Larry Flynt (may the Christian reader forgive the necessary mention of such vile names, and pray for their lost souls).

In these perilous, last days, pornography has evolved into a $10 billion per year industry! This is not surprising. Once we even begin to frown upon the landmarks and barriers set by former generations, we are sliding down a slippery slope: "The old ways are not good enough for our generation. The old paths are too narrow (Jer.6:16, Heb12:13). The Old Version is too restrictive. We want to wear what we please and view whatever we desire." But once a knot is finally untied, the whole quickly unravels. Pornography never satisfies:

Proverbs 27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

Those who view pornography become enslaved by it. They must become increasingly depraved as they demand things more perverse than before (Rom.1:26, Prov.1:19). Pornography breeds sodomy. And then sodomy breeds child molestation and other vile deeds. Therefore, a society given over to pornography under the guise of "free speech," is a society that is exploding (or about to explode) in rapists, murderers, cannibals, adulterers, molesters, abusers, etc. The Word of God (and the experience of history) teaches that a nation or kingdom given over to such depravity will quickly self-destruct. The Bible predicts just such a state for the entire world in the coming Tribulation period:

Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

Mild pornography is now on prime-time TV, and it can be found in many worldly movies viewed by thousands of Christians every Lord's Day. Yet, as already stated, pornography in its most hard-core, blatant form has also become BIG business. Giant corporations such as AT&T, Time Warner, General Motors, News Corp. etc. all have a big financial stake in lewd, pornographic films:

"AT&T Corp., the nation's biggest communications company, offers a hard-core sex channel called the Hot Network to subscribers to its broadband cable service. It also owns a company that sells sex videos to nearly a million hotel rooms." (N.Y. Times News Service, T. Egan, Oct.22, 2000)


DirecTV is the No.1 satellite provider of pornography. Rupert Murdock (the owner of the N.I.V.) has been trying hard to purchase it. The 8.7 million Americans who subscribe to DirecTV (a General Motors subsidiary) buy nearly $200 million a year in hard-core porno films from satellite! But not far behind GM is EchoStar Communications Corporation. THIS COMPANY IS THE NO.2 SATELLITE PROVIDER OF PORNO FILMS. It is backed by Rupert Murdock (the owner of the rights to the N.I.V.)! This company makes more money selling pornographic films than Playboy does with its magazine, cable and Internet businesses COMBINED! This same Rupert Murdock (i.e. News Corp.) owns HarperCollins Publishing (with Zondervan), the New York Post, FOX Television, TV Guide, Seventeen Magazine and many other newspapers around the world. It is therefore a fact that when Christians support these companies with their time and money, they are helping to support the pornographic industry. Is it right to speak against sin in its worst forms while at the same time we finance it? We are not talking about a controversial sin. We are talking about the worst kind of "adult" sex films! Should we support these things with our money when we have a choice in the matter?:

Pr 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law CONTEND with them.
5 Evil men understand not JUDGMENT: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.

Rupert Murdock (i.e. Harper-Collins) also owns and publishes the Good News Bible, The Amplified Version, some Christian hymnals, and, as already stated, the NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION! Therefore, this same corporation is making money off of many gullible Christians while it invests in sex films, pornography, lewd TV, pro homosexual books, etc. How can this be? Simple. The motive is MONEY:

1 Timothy 6:10 For the love of MONEY is the root of ALL EVIL: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

And most Christians know we are supposed to be courteous, loving, meek and humble. There is therefore no holy outrage among the saints. Yet, the Bible NEVER says we are to be stupid, gullible or simple! In fact, it clearly warns against these things:

Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your LOVE may abound yet more and more in KNOWLEDGE and in ALL JUDGMENT;

Proverbs 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.

Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather REPROVE them. 13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

2 Corinthians 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are NOT IGNORANT of his devices.

If we believe in a literal Devil who is transformed into an angel of light (along with his ministers), do we really think he will not attempt to corrupt the Word of God? My second question is, in what manner will he attempt to corrupt it? Will he launch an open attack or a SUBTIL attack? Did ye never read in the scriptures (Mt.21:42, Gen.3:1, 2Cor.11:3)?

When you purchase or endorse an N.I.V. you are supporting a corporation that makes more money off of pornography than any of the infamous magazines such as Playboy, Hustler, etc. Larry Flynt (the owner of a popular, hard-core, porno magazine) states:

"We're in the small leagues compared to some of those companies..." (N.Y. Times News Service, T. Egan, Oct.22, 2000)

Should these new bible publishers (owned by men making millions off of pornography) be trusted to provide you with the unadulterated Word of God? They live for money. Why is it that they are not afraid to promote the N.I.V.? Could it be that they know that these versions are so watered-down that they will not hurt their blossoming pornography business?

A tabloid-porno king owns the rights to some of the most popular new bible versions (i.e. NIV, Good News, Amplified). If you will use and endorse these versions, then do NOT ever complain about the spread of pornography; and whatever you do, do NOT ever say Christians should boycott some company for endorsing ANY sin, product or viewpoint!

In response to last week's KA Update, one concerned brother contacted Zondervan. The following are some noteworthy excerpts from Zondervan's response:

"In 1988, Zondervan became a division of HarperCollins, one of the worldâ€™s leading English-language publishers. HarperCollins is part of News America Publishing Group, a division of News Corporation. While Zondervan has a financial reporting relationship with HarperCollins, the company operates autonomously on a day-to-day basis. In fact, our parent company strongly encourages Zondervan to stay true to our mission and core Christian values. We have remained true to the heritage of our founders, and we are committed to building our business around those virtues....This much-loved text has served the Church for more than 25 years, and with Godâ€™s blessing it will continue to serve the Church for generations to come. We hope it will become a permanent classic like the King James...News Corp is a very large business and parents many companies. I am not familiar with all of them. Some may conceivably be engaged in questionable publishing from a Christian perspective...Zondervanâ€™s mission is to be a leading Christian communications company that meets the needs of people with resources that glorify Jesus Christ and promote biblical principles. I hope this information is helpful and renews your faith in the NIV and Zondervan. Maryanne, Customer Support."

Now I will ask the dear reader a very blunt question: Can a company that is the #2 provider of HARD-CORE, satellite pornography films in the world be said to be "conceivably" engaged in "questionable" publishing from a CHRISTIAN perspective? QUESTIONABLE!? The facts I documented are not hidden. It would have been more honest if they would have replied in the following manner:

"News Corp is a very large business and parents many companies. WE DO OUR VERY BEST NOT TO BE FAMILIAR with ALL of them. Some may conceivably be engaged in DISGUSTING, PERVERTED, SODOMITE, REPROBATE publishing from a Christian perspective."

But of course "sodomite" has been taken out of the N.I.V. and therefore it is doubtful if they would ever use such a word (it has been reported that Dr. Marten H. Woudstra, the late Chairman of the NIV Old Testament Committee was a homosexual; he once claimed that there is nothing in the Old Testament that corresponds to "homosexuality" - -http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/woudstra.htm - The NIV translators therefore preferred "shrine prostitute").

But what about Zondervan's answer?:

"While Zondervan has a financial reporting relationship with HarperCollins, the company operates autonomously on a day-to-day basis. In fact, our parent company strongly encourages Zondervan to stay true to our mission and core Christian values."

What is a "financial reporting relationship"? That is doublespeak. It's like calling the perverted sin of SODOMY a "gay, alternate lifestyle." The Nazis called the GAS CHAMBER the "shower room." The DUMP becomes a "sanitary landfill." This whole business is called "smoothing things over" for the sake of the mighty dollar (Isa.30:10, Rom.16:18).

The NIV is a corrupt version for an apostate generation raised on evolution, agnosticism, relativity, yoga, fast food, TV, psychoheresy, brain drugs, PMA, HBO, values clarification, Entertainment Tonight, feminism and public education. Its many errors are easy to document. But my MAIN point in the last article was simply to admonish Christians not to boycott some department store chain for selling an abortion pill or some type of pornography IF you will continue to endorse the NIV! That would be hypocrisy. It would be double-mindedness. The owners of the rights to the NIV are the LEADERS in the pornographic industry.

But since the point has been raised, I will address it further. Can Christians trust these big companies to allow their subsidiaries to operate "autonomously," apart from their control? We can see why they would have a strong motive to SAY this. But what would be their motive to
actually OPERATE in this fashion? Is it logical for a Christian to trust the lost, billionaire leaders of the pornographic industry to remain DETACHED where money is concerned?

Let's examine this from another angle. Has News Corp. always allowed their subsidiaries to operate autonomously? While driving the other day I happened to hear a bit of the Marlin Maddox radio program. They main topic was the remark that the younger Murdock made concerning Falon Gong and China (I am surprised no one called in to comment on the NIV.) They were enraged at the Murdocks for "selling out" and turning a blind eye to the sufferings of the people under Communism. China represents the worldâ€™s largest media market. It is five times larger than the U.S. market. The Murdocks do not want to do anything to disrupt cashing in on that market. Marlin Maddox had an interview with a man who fled China; he had been dropped from a HarperCollins publishing deal because his important book was speaking out against the Chinese. The U.S. News reported in 1998:

"The scandal that could have far-reaching repercussions involved HarperCollins, a unit of News Corp. The publishing house last month dropped a book by Christopher Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. The ostensible reason was that the writing was inadequate. But the
action fit a pattern of Murdoch's adjusting editorial policies so as not to offend the Chinese leadership in Beijing. Murdoch's News Corp. has invested heavily in a satellite broadcasting business based in Hong Kong and eventually hopes to be able to beam programming to mainland China's huge population. Murdoch denied ordering that the book be dropped. But a memo by HarperCollins Chairman Eddie Bell, which surfaced last week, indicated otherwise: 'Murdoch has outlined to me the negative aspects of publication, which I fully understand,'...After being pilloried in newspapers, Murdoch issued a limited apology to Patten for any suggestion that his book had been rejected for "being too boring." HarperCollins later reached an out-of-court financial settlement with Patten, who had threatened to sue the publishing house...During the HarperCollins contretemps, potentially damaging remarks on China by a former Times writer also came to light. 'The Times has simply decided, because of Murdoch's interests, not to cover China in a serious way,' Jonathan Mirsky, the paper's former East Asian editor, said at a conference in January, according to a transcript that recently appeared on the Internet." (3-23-98)

Thus, the "top" does control the bottom - when it cares to. And why not? A man ought to have right to control his businesses in whatever manner he chooses. And we ought to have the right to REJECT anything associated with the pornographic industry!

Conclusion? Go burn your NIV and read the Authorized Version. You'll have a better conscience. The A.V. Translators knew more Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic than these modern scholars will ever know. And the fruits of the A.V. show that it is a work of God's Providence (Isa.55:11). No other version is HARDER on sin than the KJV. And no other version guards the Gospel of grace through faith alone like the KJV. The KJV is God's Word in English for this age.

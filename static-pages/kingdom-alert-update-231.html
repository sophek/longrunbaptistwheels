WATCH OUT FOR RAPISTS IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES!
********************************************************
Saturday night, two weeks ago, at about 11:45, I [Joey Faust] was in my
office finishing up some things for Sunday. There was some snow still on
the ground. My office sits about 20 feet directly behind my home.
Something seemed strange. I do not know what I heard. Were my dogs in a
fight with a raccoon? By the grace of God I got up and walked to the door
of my office. As I opened the door, with my mind deep in spiritual things,
I heard my wife yelling. I thought it was strange for her to yell at one
of the children this way, especially at this time of night. As I took
another step in my confusion, I heard my wife using a tone of voice that
caused my hair to stand up. I knew at that moment that something, or
someone was in my home. I roared with all my night, and at that moment a
man came out my back door with his hands up. I threatened him, and he
acted drunk and said he was lost and that he thought this was a Baptist
church (my home sits on the opposite end of the property than the church,
on a ten acre lot in a rural area). As he quickly made his way around the
corner, my wife told me that he did not touch her and that she was going
to call the police. At this point, I was thankful that no harm was done
and that this obviously drunk man was leaving. At that time, I had no
weapon and I did not know what he had in the pocket of his ski jacket. A
few minutes later, when my wife got off the phone with 911, she told me
that the man had come through the back door, turned on my bedroom light,
and while my wife was awaking, he made his way to the side of her bed. She
said that he did not in any way act drunk. She jumped to the other side of
the bed and screamed and told him her husband was next door. He decided to
look out the back door. Then, apparently thinking she was lying, he
returned to the bedroom. At that point my wife began screaming for him to
leave the room in the name of Jesus. And at that point I roared, upon
hearing a sound in my wife's voice that I never want to hear again. I
praise the Lord for His mercy to my home. And I praise my wife for her
boldness, and the fact that she kept her head. There have been MANY
changes that we have made around our home since this event. One, is that I
will now lock the back door when I go to my office. I was under the
assumption that I could certainly hear anyone open the back door, and that
I could hear a scream. This was foolish of me. The man was white, stocky,
with blue eyes. I have since learned (what I did not know before) that
rapists, etc. will always have some excuse if they walk in a home and
happen upon a gun pointed at them. They will say they are lost, or looking
for directions, or that they are hungry, etc. We are fast approaching the
perilous times as in the days of Sodom (2 Timothy 3:1, Genesis 19). In the
days of Lot, homosexual rapists tried to break down Lot's door. With
Internet pornography in the homes of millions of people, we cannot even
imagine the perverted rapists that society will soon reap from this unholy
sowing of smut. As Christians, we must learn to be more careful. The Devil
took advantage of the slightest lack of caution on my part. Does he not do
the same in our spiritual lives? How many Christians allow their children
to attend public schools with the wicked, watch worldly television, etc.?
Will not the Devil slither through any hole that he can find? I know of
one fundamental Baptist couple in another town that has sadly discovered
that when they sent their young boy to school, he met some homosexual
friends who converted him to that unholy lifestyle. How sad they must be
at this point. We never expect the Devil to take advantage of unguarded
areas in our lives. But I have learned a lesson, and I hope others may
also grow more cautious in these perilous times, not only in regard to
their physical lives, but also in regard to their spiritual lives. Please
pray for my dear wife, and I again thank God that she was not harmed.

STREET PREACHER, MIKE ANDERSON,  IN JAIL
*************************************************
http://qctimes.com/internal.php?story_id=1024864&t=Gateway&c=30,1024864

Brother Mike Anderson, who is a kind brother with a sweet, talented
musical family, has been jailed for refusing to pay a fine for street
preaching. It appears that they are trying to set a snare before him by
having a woman officer search him, so they may accuse him. Please pray for
him and his family that he will not have to stay in jail:

Amos 5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightly.

Isaiah 29:21 That make a man an offender for a word, and LAY A SNARE for
him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of
nought.

********************************************************************
PLEASE PRAY FOR SISTER JANICE COLSTON AND HER PUBLIC SCHOOL MINISTRY
********************************************************************
Christians have been trying for decades to get evolution and humanism out
of public education. But imagine what would occur if every church had a
literature ministry on the sidewalks near the schools! Sister Colston, a
friend of our church, decided to pass out tracts in front of Ft. Worth
schools. And it soon resulted in the schools attempting to forbid sister
Colston from handing out literature - not on school property - but on the
sidewalks! The school has momentarily backed down when they were
threatened with a lawsuit. In the latest note, sister Colston writes:

"Hi pastor Joey, Just to update you on the school situation. The school
district responded to our demand letter saying that I can distribute
literature on the sidewalks in front of the schools for now. They have
turned the matter over to a lawyer (other than the lawyer from the
district) and will be investigating (I don't know what). We have extended
the time that we are giving them until after the next school board meeting
which is March 9th. My attorney told them that if this isn't resolved (by
them giving me a letter stating my right to distribute literature on the
sidewalks) by March 11th, we will file suit. Things are really tightening
up for Christians (as I know you already know). In Waco, they have passed
a City ordinance forbidding anyone from passing out literature in front of
schools and abortion clinics during school hours and during the hours the
clinic is operating. I joined about 35 other Christians in Waco Wednesday
before last to protest in front of the abortion clinic. The police came to
warn us and present us with a copy of the City ordinance (which the pastor
in charge had just burned). It was a very moving service of singing and
preaching in front of the clinic. On April 21st, GLSEN is sponsoring 'Day
of Silence' at the schools where students (supposedly) remain silent a
good part of the day to bring attention to how persecuted gay students are
in school. I plan to be out to visit you next Wednesday. God bless you,
Jan."

Please pray for sister Colston and her willingness to bring light to these
children. And please consider that it is one thing to talk about how bad
the schools are, and it is another thing to go and give them God's truth,
in a manner that is not only Biblical, but Constitutional.

THE PASSION OF ADAM AND EVE! NOW PLAYING AT A THEATER NEAR YOU!
************************************************************************
Warning: Rated-R for graphic sexual content and nudity. Parents please be
advised to research this movie before viewing it with small children.
Language is in ancient Hebrew.

In the February 15th, _______ edition of the "The Laodicean Times," a
lengthy interview with the Rev.______ appeared concerning the
controversial movie, "The Passion of Adam and Eve." This interview is
reproduced below for our readers:

"Churches across the country are buying up tickets to see 'THE PASSION OF
ADAM AND EVE.' Who would have ever guessed that so many conservative
Christians would support a movie with the sensuous, teen pop idol _____,
starring as Eve? Nevertheless some of the most conservative pastors from
America's largest churches have come out in support of this movie. Rev.
____, usually known for his fiery rhetoric, stated:

"We understand that some people will not approve of the graphic nudity in
this film. Yet, I have spoken to Ms. _____, the producer, and she really
has a heart for our young people. Many will call this pornography.
However, we feel that this movie will do wonders in the hearts of our
young people. It will show them that true marriage is between a man and a
woman. This is how God originally designed it. Now, I don't want to lie to
you. This movie is graphic. It seeks to capture the marriage bed in its
original, pristine purity in Paradise. This is how sex was before it was
corrupted by people with impure minds in our culture. Some parents may not
want to bring their preteens to see this movie. However, we are taking our
whole youth group. We want them to FEEL what it was like in the Garden of
Eden when Adam "knew" his wife. This may be the most important movie ever
made. This movie may bring a revival of traditional morality to our land."

Reporter: "But Rev._____, how would you respond to the recent attacks on
this movie by Pastor_____?"

"Well, I say that there will always be some Christians, and they are in
the minority, who are still living in the 1950's. The Bible says, 'to the
pure, all things are pure.' And if they cannot see this movie as a
glorification of God's original design for marriage, then perhaps they
should not see it. But we feel, and my popular Christian psychologist
friend, the famous, Dr.______, agrees, that what we need is something like
this to wake up our churches. You know, we certainly expected the feminist
and homosexual organizations to be against Ms.______, the producer (who by
the way, is a wonderful Catholic), but we are very disappointed in people
like Pastor_____. From what I hear, he has not even viewed the movie. His
critiques are from negative reviews from Ms._____ 's enemies. From what I
read, in his nitpicking, he has even attacked the fact that Eve is being
portrayed as originally having short hair! He also venomously attacks the
movie for portraying Adam and Eve as originally created simultaneously as
bi-sexual (the sexes appearing when Adam was divided into). He also does
not like the fact that God is portrayed as bi-sexual, warning Eve not to
obey her husband, etc. While we are agreement that most of this is not in
the originals, and we regret the fact that Ms._____ did not stay closer to
the Biblical text, we feel that such minor errors do not take away from
the overall good this movie will do in reestablishing some of the better
parts of traditional morality to our hurting land."

Reporter: "Do you have any final thoughts, Rev.____?"

"Just one. You know, you and I would not even be here if it were not for
Adam and Eve having sexual relations. Therefore, how some people can class
a movie graphically portraying the pure sex of Adam and Eve as pornography
is beyond me! Many of the finest Christians in the Middle Ages, etc.,
often used nudity in paintings, prints, etc. It is time that we separate
impure nudity, from holy nudity. And I think Ms.______ has captured the
sexual purity of the Garden of Eden like not other will be able to do for
some time. I applaud her. And I stand by her. And I am sorrowed by the
attacks upon her. The Pope has come out in support of her, but a few of
the homosexual groups have attacked her. And, as you have already stated,
a few legalistic Christians are nitpicking her work to death. But they
will not do her any real damage. In the end, we know her work is being
used by God to bring healing to our land. This is why we encourage every
pastor to take their whole youth groups to see this movie."

Reporter: "Thank you, Rev.____. You are obviously very passionate about
this. And we wish you and your church well."

*********************************************************
HAS THE BATTLE AGAINST GRAPHIC GORE BEEN LOST?
*********************************************************
In 1967, the movie "Bonnie & Clyde" ran over fences that society had
earlier set to keep violent gore out of films. And since the 1960's, the
Devil appears to be running for a touchdown with violent gore as the
football (he will be later stopped and thrown into Hell by the return of
Jesus Christ!). Until then, we pray the Lord will bring a temporary
revival to the churches of America. Yet, we know that in the end, people
will not endure sound doctrine (2 Timothy 4). There appears to be a step
by step, line upon line, rejection of sound doctrine and godliness. Once a
piece of the doctrinal foundation has been removed, it appears as if no
Biblical, rational argumentation can replace it in the minds of Christians
and professing Christians.

There was a time when practically every Christian, and even every moral
person, agreed that the masses should be protected from viewing graphic
violence, especially for entertainment or curiosity purposes. Movies and
television programs had to follow strict guidelines. Why? It is obvious
that the entertainment industry launched America down a slippery slope,
and that before long the laws against decency would be gradually abolished
or made more lenient. But this does not change the FACT that earlier
generations, REALIZED THE NECESSITY of guarding against graphic gore, and
bloody violence on the screen.

Now, must ask a crucial question: WHY DID EARLIER GENERATIONS PASS LAWS
AGAINST GRAPHIC GORE AND BLOODY VIOLENCE BEING SHOWN IN MOVIES AND
TELEVISION PROGRAMS? There are only a few possible answers:

1. "They lacked the technology and special effects to make violent gore
realistic."
This is somewhat true. However, earlier generations certainly had the
means to attempt to make violence realistic and bloody. Yet, they not only
chose not to do so, but they passed laws FORBIDDING IT. We must therefore
continue to ask why earlier generations saw the need to forbid graphic
violence.

2. "Modern people have progressed on the evolutionary scale to a higher
plane of consciousness and wisdom." According to this insane view, the
mammoth increases in sodomy, rape, murder, rebellion, stupidity, drug
addiction and fornication among today's youth is a sign of a blossoming
enlightenment in our culture! Aside from the fact that macro-evolution is
scientifically and Biblically impossible and absurd, it is reasonable to
conclude that this modern, television-saturated generation knows more
about good and evil, morality, godliness, purity, etc., than earlier
generations? Would it not be more reasonable (as well as Biblical - see 2
Timothy 3 and 4) to conclude that the earlier generations who forbade
graphic gore on the screen were WISER about morality, and the consequences
of regularly viewing such violence, than this modern generation? We must
therefore look for another answer to our question.

3. "People today are more morally depraved and foolish than earlier
generations, and therefore, they CANNOT understand why earlier generations
would have OUTLAWED graphic violence, bloody gore, etc., on the screen.
Their earlier wisdom is now 'too high' for the majority of modern
television addicts to grasp." This is indeed the answer to our question.
Earlier generations passed laws forbidding graphic violence because they
knew some basic things about life and godliness that modern people can no
longer understand.

This is why I say that the battle against violent gore has been lost. The
whole argument against showing and viewing extreme violence in movies can
no longer be comprehended by most people. Famous Christian leaders stand
before preachers and proclaim something to the effect of, "There are
amazing opportunities for us today as Evangelical Christians. God will use
Christian movies. Now, we must now make movies with graphic sex and
unwholesome language. But we are going to have to put LOTS OF VIOLENCE in
them to sell the movies. But this is okay. There is violence in the
Bible." Yes, the battle against bloody violence has been lost. Culture has
taken another fall, and many of even the "conservative" churches are sadly
leading the way down to Hell.

I say the battle against bloody violence in movies and television has been
lost for two reasons. One, the addiction to bloody gore must be either
defeated or continually satisfied in ever-increasing ways. Therefore, the
addiction to gore is so strong that the lust for violence drowns out any
voice of reason or wisdom, which says clearly that IF SUCH LUST FOR
VIEWING BLOODY SUFFERING IS NOT QUICKLY ABATED, WE WILL BE BACK TO THE
ROMAN CIRCUSES VERY SOON! Secondly, many Christians who are supposed to be
the light of the world no longer speak against violence in movies. They
will not endure sound doctrine in this regard (Phil. 4:8). They cannot
understand it. Thirdly, now that Christians (and almost every conservative
leader or commentator) has continually jumped on the bandwagon to praise
every bloody, violent "war" movie that has a noble theme, and now that
practically every Christian leader has praised Gibson's gory movie, it is
likely that THE WORLD WILL NEVER AGAIN LISTEN TO ANY CHRISTIAN RAISE A
VOICE AGAINST VIOLENCE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY! They will say "what
is good for the goose is good for the gander."

****************************************************************
OBJECTIONS FROM PRO-GIBSON FLICK CHRISTIANS - ANSWERED
****************************************************************

1. "But this is a wonderful opportunity to preach the Gospel. Therefore,
the Gibson movie should be supported financially."

Answer: 9-11 was a convenient opportunity to preach the Gospel. But I will
not support and fund Islamic terrorists. In other words, because God can
and does use the wrath of man to praise Him, this does not mean that we
should adopt the Jesuit philosophy that some supposed good justifies any
means.

2. "But people are leaving this movie emotionally moved."

Answer: The same effect could have be accomplished if Gibson made a
pro-Judas movie that paints Judas as a victim and spends an hour
graphically depicting his remorse, depression, sorrow, and final suicide,
ultimately showing his BOWELS BURSTING! Jesuits have established schools
and done "good things" among the heathen for centuries. But just as the
end does not justify the means, partial goodness does not justify great
evils. Bible believing Christians know and believe that a Roman Catholic
America is a GREAT EVIL, and will result in the persecution and damnation
of thousands of souls.

3. "But this will be good for the lost people to see what Jesus went
through."

Answer: While it may help some, in interviewing multiple people the moment
they left this movie, a common response was as the following:

"Did you just see the Passion?"
"Yes."
"Was it violent and bloody"?
"Yes, but NO MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER BLOODY MOVIES I REGULARLY WATCH."

Therefore, this movie will have a CHEAPENING effect of bringing the Four
Gospels down to the level of a Terminator or Rambo movie.

4. "I am a Christian, and I think this is wonderful. I think people need
to see this. I think you are wrong about THIS movie."

Answer: How many rated R or PG-13 movies have you seen in the past two
years with nudity and violent gore? Therefore, we see that the ROOT of
this debate is not THIS movie, it is simply your addiction to the IDOL of
Hollywood' sex and gore. This movie simply provides a supposed godly
reason to eat pop corn and view gory violence.

5 "But people have no idea what Jesus went though."

Answer: Then let them read and hear the Scriptures. One girl responded to
my tract by writing:

"You see, people don't truly understand the suffering that Jesus went
through because there aren't very many details [in the Bible] pertaining
to his crucifiction."

Do you see that? People are seeking an EXTRA-BIBLICAL experience, thinking
they will know Jesus better through it. But we can never know Jesus more
than by diligently studying the Scriptures in humility, faith and holy
fear, praying fervently, obeying our Lord's commandments, and not being
ashamed of His words before a wicked and perverse generation.
 
***********************************************
MY GOSPEL TRACT AGAINST GIBSON'S MOVIE
***********************************************
 The following is a tract that we handed out in downtown Fort Worth as
people gathered for the Gibson movie. The Lord used it as a witnessing
tool to bring one girl to a smiling, soul liberating salvation that I know
of. Praise God!

WHY YOU SHOULD NOT SEE GIBSON'S GORY MOVIE

1. It is R-rated for violence and bloody, GRAPHIC GORE! A supposed
Biblical, noble or historical theme does not justify showing gory violence
on a big screen with special effects, modern technology and popcorn. It is
no more proper and holy to view such horrible, gory violence in this
manner, simply because the theme of the movie is Biblical, than it would
be to view a modern movie portrayal of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
making babies with nudity, close ups, big screens, special effects, etc.!
The Bible simply says:

"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived..." (Genesis 4:1).

In the same manner, the Bible leaves out many gory details of the
Crucifixion of Christ (see Matthew 27). We no more need to see a Hollywood
"star" half-naked, bleeding to death in violent gore, than we need to see
Hollywood "stars" pretending to be Adam and Eve, having sexual relations
in full nudity! America is simply addicted to bloody violence. Many will
respond by arguing that such detailed, violent gore is permissible in
movies if they have a Biblical or historical theme. But such argumentation
forgets that in ancient times, when thousands flocked to the EARLY ROMAN
CIRCUSES to view Christians being fed to lions (in order to satisfy their
curiosity and lust for entertainment), the butchery was CLOAKED IN A NOBLE
STORYLINE. The victims were forced to be actors and actresses to satisfy
the LUST FOR BLOOD:

Romans 1:29-31: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
wickedness...MURDER...Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which
commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have
pleasure in them that do them.

God destroyed the world of Noah for VIOLENCE (Genesis 6:13). Jesus warned
that in the last days before His Second Coming, the modern world would be
exactly as in the days of Noah:

Matthew 24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
Son of man be.

Earlier generations were not so hardened and desensitized as people are
today. They passed laws forbidding plays and movies from showing blood,
sex and violence. They knew that movies had the power to harden people to
violence and cause them to want to see increasing amounts of it.

2. Jesus did not have long hair. Jesus was a Nazarene from a town called
Nazareth. He was not a Nazarite (i.e. a Jewish man who lets his hair grow
long for a period of time during his vow). A man who lets his hair grow
long like a girl is a shame, and this movie "star" is bringing reproach
upon Jesus Christ:

1 Corinthians 11:14 Doth not even nature [i.e. conscience] itself teach
you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is
given her for a covering.

3. Mel Gibson is a Roman Catholic. The man playing Jesus in the movie is a
Roman Catholic. Roman Catholicism teaches that the shed Blood of Jesus is
NOT sufficient to justify a person before God and save them in eternity.
It teaches that a person must also do good works, perform the sacraments,
penance, etc., in order to be eternally saved. But Jesus, on the Cross,
said, "It is FINISHED" (John 19:30). The Bible, contrary to Roman
Catholicism, teaches that because of the Blood of Jesus, shed for the sins
of every person, any sinner can be eternally saved by simply receiving the
FREE GIFT of salvation by simply believing (trusting) that Jesus has paid
the full price to save them:

Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Romans 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus:
25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation [i.e. God's wrath
appeased] through faith in his blood...

Get saved today!

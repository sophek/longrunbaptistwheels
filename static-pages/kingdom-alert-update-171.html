STAGESETTING FOR THE RISE OF BABYLONIAN AND PERSIAN KINGDOMS
"Iraq 'close to nuclear bomb goal' - Senate hears dire warnings by dissidents - Saddam Hussein will have enough weapons-grade uranium for three nuclear bombs by 2005, a former Iraqi nuclear engineer told senators yesterday, as the US Congress held hearings on whether to go to war. Launching what it called a 'national discussion' amid frequent reports that the Bush administration is honing its plans for an assault on Iraq, the Senate foreign relations committee was also warned by an expert on the Iraqi military not to underestimate the strength of Saddam's army and air defences and not to doubt that any invasion would require overwhelming force. A succession of expert witnesses at the high-profile hearings argued that the danger posed by Saddam to the US and the rest of the world was CONSTANTLY INCREASING as the Iraqi dictator attempted to build chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Khidir Hamza, who played a leading role in Iraq's nuclear weapon programme before defecting in 1994, cited German intelligence in saying: 'With more than 10 tonnes of uranium and one tonne of slightly enriched uranium...in its possession, Iraq has enough to generate the needed bomb-grade uranium for three nuclear weapons by 2005.'...His pessimistic assessment was echoed by other witnesses, including the former UN chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler....Anthony Cordesman, a senior analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and the author of a new assessment of Iraqi military strength, had bitter criticism for hawks in the administration who portrayed the 400,000-strong Iraqi army as an easy opponent. 'Iraq might be a far easier opponent than its force strengths indicate,' he said, 'but it is also potentially a very serious military opponent indeed, and to be perfectly blunt, I think only fools would bet the lives of other men's sons and daughters on their own arrogance and call this force a 'cakewalk' or a 'speed-bump'.' He said that though regular army units had less than 70% manning levels, Iraq still had 2,200 battle tanks, 3,700 other armoured vehicles and 2,400 major artillery weapons. He also warned that US warplanes attacking Iraqi cities would fly into a blizzard of anti-aircraft fire from 'one of the most dense air defence networks around urban and populated areas in the world.'...."

"Iran Stockpiles Weapons That 'Blister' and 'Choke' Humans - A senior White House foreign policy adviser Friday said Iran was manufacturing and stockpiling chemical weapons aimed to 'blister' and 'choke' their human targets. 'Although Iran is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the government is developing the capability to produce chemical weapons. For example, it has manufactured and stockpiled blister, blood and choking agents and grown its pesticides production capability,' Zalmay Khalilzad, the National Security Council's director for the Near East, told analysts and reporters. The concern about Iran's chemical weapons program comes as the Bush administration has stepped up diplomatic efforts with Russia to end its licit and illicit nuclear technical exchanges with Iran...." (NewsMax.com Wires, Aug. 3, 2002)

Comments: Pride certainly comes before a fall (Proverbs 11:2, 16:18, Daniel 4:37). Therefore, not only is it true that, "only fools would bet the lives of other men's sons and daughters on their own arrogance and call this force a 'cakewalk,'" but there are too more dangerous problems that need to be considered:

1. Immoral nations that do not repent of sin after merciful warnings, soon get severely judged by God (Genesis 19:24, Jonah 1:2, Matthew 11:21). History bears record that God is not asleep! He still works in the affairs of men and nations (Jeremiah 18:7-8). God's people should therefore continue to sound the alarm!

2. The Bible clearly predicts that Iraq (and then Iran) will arise as POWERFUL world kingdoms at the start of the coming Tribulation period (Daniel chapters 2, 7, 8). But there is no reason why Iraq could not already be in power when the Tribulation begins (as is currently the case with Israel).

Based on the above facts, our leaders in America do not need to provoke the Lord Jesus Christ further by making public prayers to an Islamic god. They need to stand for religious liberty and use their power to contend against the immoral sins that are revealed in nature (conscience), which every nation on earth is responsible before God to hate and avoid (Romans 2). These sins are such things as infant murder (abortion), sodomy, adultery, fornication, stealing, etc. America is even more responsible, since the revealed light of the Gospel has been manifested so greatly. If America is not judged by God soon, in a greater manner, it will only be because there are so many RIGHTEOUS CHRISTIANS still within it, that are praying and preaching (Genesis 18:32). May the Lord continue to show us mercy and keep the doors of liberty open. But let us not presume upon the long-suffering of the Most High! Let all leaders (political and religious) get on their faces and confess their sins and ask for mercy concerning this land. Even so, come Lord Jesus!

WHY I LEFT ISLAM FOR CHRIST, BY M.A. QAYYUM DASKAWIE (1931)

"I was born a Moslem, but although I attended both a mission school and a Christian college my interest in Christianity did not begin until after I had decided not to continue my college work. Relieved of these studies I could devote myself to books on religion. My uncle is well known in North India as the compiler of dictionaries in Hindustani, Arabic, and Persian, and as the author of several books dealing with religious subjects. I was particularly interested in one book in my uncle's library, written in Urdu (or Hindustani) verse called 'The Prayer of a True Christian.' Moslems claim to be heirs of all the prophets and the sacred writings that preceded the revelation to the Prophet of Arabia. 'The Prayer of a True Christian' was written by a Moslem to controvert Christian teaching and was designed to show how Islamic religion was 'true Christianity' from which the Christians had gone astray. There were numerous references in it to various passages in the Bible. I read the book and re-read it. A thought struck me! Though I could not verify the references to the Old Testament I decided to see how this book compared with the New Testament, a copy of which had been presented to my father about the year 1898 by the Punjab Branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society. I had seen the book lie on the shelf as long as I could recollect, but it had never been read. Beginning to read the Testament I found things in it that I could not understand and other things that I could not half understand. I began with the Gospel of Matthew, and when I came to the Sermon on the Mount, I said: 'HERE IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I AM ACCUSTOMED TO HEARING. CAN THESE THINGS BE SO?' There was nothing in the Koran that I could remember which spoke of such attitudes toward God and man. When I went over again some portions of the Koran I was more disconcerted than ever. When I came to the Gospel of John, I found an atmosphere altogether different from any I had ever breathed before. Here was God spoken of as loving sinful men. I had heard of God judging men on the last day, but never of God loving them in the present day. In fact, it had never occurred to me that God had anything so directly to do with men. It was strange! On the other hand, There were things in the New Testament that were extremely repugnant to a Moslem. I had, for instance, always imagined that the Christians worshipped three gods. Islam has laid great stress on the unity of God. 'There is no god but God' has been the creed of Islam throughout these centuries. It puzzled me that Christians could not see that there was only one God. I could not see how such a spiritual religion could go astray on the most fundamental question of all. 'If there seems to be any truth in Christianity,' I reasoned, 'it is what is left to it of the original teachings of Jesus. Truly the Injil (Gospel) has been subverted by the Christians.' There was another difficulty - the problem of the Cross. To an orthodox Moslem there is nothing more absurd than to believe that the Son of God was crucified for the sins of men. How can the righteous suffer for the unrighteous? How is it possible for one man to take away the sins of the whole race? To depend on fastings, endless prayers, penance and alms is understandable, but to think that mere faith is sufficient - why it is preposterous! Even disregarding other objections, a great gulf exists between Christians and Moslems. By common consent Christianity has been regarded among the people of India as the religion of the foreigner and outcastes. Consider the disgrace of accepting a religion of the outcastes! The term Christian is to us a synonym for a scavenger and a pariah. High-born men could not think much of Christianity! But I could not overlook the New Testament. I was rent between two types of teaching. I read other books on the subject, but for fear of arousing the suspicion of my parents I had to keep everything secret. I studied till late at night, long after everyone in the house had retired. I also sought out a Christian friend who had taught me in college, and had a long talk with him. At the end of the interview I was convinced of two things: first, that the Christians did not worship three gods, but only one; secondly, that sin is a far more serious affair than to be removed by fastings and alms. But I was more puzzled than ever. I tried to reason myself out of the situation and then tried to forget the whole matter. Anything true in Christianity I attributed to its primitive form, and its attraction for me I thought to be the suggestion of the devil. But I could not forget what I had discovered. I knew I was a sinner and that I needed a Saviour, but I thought that Christ could not have anything to do with this. Weeks of suspense and agony passed. I was seriously in doubt and decided to READ THE GOSPELS AGAIN to see what faults I could find in them. But I only discovered that Jesus had a far larger place in them than I was willing to admit. 'God,' said I, 'if this is correct what shall I do? Can the New Testament be right after all?' Another thought deterred me. If I should follow the way of the Gospel I could not stay with my loved ones. I dared not think of all that was involved in my turning away from the faith of my fathers. But I had to make a choice between God and man. Jesus had anticipated this difficulty and said that His followers must be ready to give up everything to follow Him and that sacrifices in this world were recompensed by rewards from the Father in heaven. Finally I decided to give up my home, my family, and my friends, and as a result suffered many hard experiences which I cannot recount. On the first of May, 1921, I was baptized and was received into the fellowship of Christ. Was this giving up of home and kindred and the other things of life worth while? During these ten years that I have tried to follow Christ I have never for a second regretted the step, but have felt that it was the wisest thing I have ever done. My reward in Christ has been far more than I had expected. Christ has shown me that in and over and behind this confusing universe is a Fatherly Heart of Love. This is a revelation no amount of money can buy and no one but Christ can substantiate. In Him was the Love of God manifested to us and in Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. He is the answer to the cry of the human heart through the centuries: 'Oh that Thou wouldst rend the heavens' and come down; that men may see face to face in the invisible God Whom they worship. To know Christ is to have life. It is to know the best that life has to offer for which to live and to strive. In Him life finds its deepest yearnings satisfied and life gains its highest worth. Apart from Him life is not worth living. Those who have not learned to know Him have not yet discovered the eternal fountain of life from which a man may drink his fill and never drain it. It is this which fills life full of joy and peace."

A MUSLIM OBJECTION ANSWERED

MUSLIM: It does not matter that you quote me your New Testament. We believe that man has added errors to the original text!

CHRISTIAN: Do you believe your Koran has errors?

MUSLIM: Absolutely not. God is able to keep it pure.

CHRISTIAN: If you will grant that God "can" do this with a Koran, then why do you not grant that He could have done the same with the Christian New Testament?

MUSLIM: I have no answer. The Christian New Testament disagrees with our Koran.

CHRISTIAN: But if you admit that God CAN keep a text "error free" IN SPITE of man, then we must not start with the Koran since it was not first. Let's assume that God DID keep the Christian Bible free from error over the centuries. In this Bible Jesus warns that many will come in His name and deceive many. He warns of false prophets. Therefore, we must first examine the claims of Mohammed and compare them to the warnings of Christ. When we do this, we see that he was a false prophet that Christ warned us about. All of mankind are sinners and we all need a Saviour to atone for ours sins. Mohammed denied that mankind needs the sacrifice of Jesus our Saviour.

MUSLIM: I believe this talk about a Saviour is a fable invented by man. Jesus was a good prophet, but that is all.

CHRISTIAN: Do you not think it is strange that you accept by blind faith that your Koran is not demonic and filled with error, yet you believe that the Christian Bible I am holding in my hand has errors? If you believe God can keep your Koran free from error, why do you not grant that the Christian Bible can be preserved free from error? I do not understand your logic.

MUSLIM: I have no answer to this. I will have to think about this.

CHRISTIAN: Okay. But please trust in Jesus Christ as your Saviour. We have all sinned and we cannot save ourselves by good deeds. Jesus is more than a prophet.

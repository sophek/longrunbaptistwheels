Robert (Bob) Wilkin of Grace Evangelical Society (G.E.S.) has banned Govett, Pember, Panton, and "The Rod: Will God Spare It" from all book-tables at the G.E.S. Conferences. Yet, Wilkin teaches that some true believers will end up in "outer darkness." Wilkin believes that these various warnings (i.e. in Hebrews, Matthew 25, etc.) are only figurative in nature, and do not imply that some unfaithful believers will be excluded from the Millennium and/or suffer any physical punishments (i.e. stripes, etc.). It appears that Wilkin actually believes that outer darkness is ETERNAL for some believers!

I believe the â€œgehennaâ€ warnings to disciples in the Gospels apply to the time period during the Kingdom of God (see the contrast in Mark 9:47). At one GES Conference, Jody Dillow taught that these warnings apply to A.D. 70 and a figurative â€œgehenna.â€ It appears that anything is allowed at G.E.S. â€“ EXCEPT our view that the Kingdom of God in these warnings is the Millennium (see 1 Cor. 15), and that therefore these warnings apply literally to punishment during that period of reward and punishment.

Why would Wilkin find our view to be so dangerous that it must be hidden from the view of mature pastors and Bible teachers? Would not a simple disclaimer be enough? Is not this reaction rather strange - especially since these early writers are the closest thing to G.E.S.'s doctrinal position on rewards that can be found in Christian history?

Nevertheless, I have written Brother Wilkin with a suggestion that we have a friendly debate, so he can clarify his own position and manifest his defense against our literal view of punishment. I received no answer. Finally, a brother in his office wrote me to say that Mr. Wilkin had been busy and would get back with me soon. Of course, after a few more attempts to contact Brother Wilkin, it is obvious that he has no intention whatsoever of replying. Is not this another strange action on the part of this brother?

When Bible teachers hide historical documentation, and ban my book, I think they should be able to demonstrate WHY this material is in error. Paul disputed daily throughout the Book of Acts. Bob Wilkin regularly debates various subjects such as Calvinism, Arminianism and Free Grace. He should have no problem publicly manifesting why he considers my book to be in error. There are sites on the web where my position (Govett, Pember, Nee, etc.) is linked to the position of G.E.S. (since G.E.S. holds to outer darkness for believers). Should not G.E.S. be interested in a debate between their own position and my position? Why the silence?

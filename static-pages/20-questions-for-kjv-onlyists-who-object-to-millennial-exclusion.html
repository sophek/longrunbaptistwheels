	<li>In 1 Corinthians 9:27 Paul labors to keep from being a "castaway." In Luke 9, Jesus addresses His disciples (including Peter, vv.20, 23), and John and James (v.27-28), and He also warns them about the possibility of being "cast away" (v.25). Why don't you use Luke 9:25 to understand what Paul means in 1 Corinthians 9:27?</li>
	<li>Did the warning in Luke 9:25 still apply to Peter, James and John when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 9:27?</li>
	<li>If it did not, at what point did the warning that Jesus gave to Peter, James and John in Luke 9:25 cease to apply to them?</li>
	<li>Why do you think the Devil would use the NIV to destroy the link between Luke 9:25 and 1 Corinthians 9:27 (by erasing the words castaway, cast away)?</li>
	<li>In Mark 9:38, John is speaking. When the Lord answers him, who does the "thy" (second person singular) refer to in Mark 9:43?</li>
	<li>Does the phrase "ye belong to Christ" in Mark 9:41 mean that John was eternally saved?</li>
	<li>In verse 50, who is Jesus addressing?</li>
	<li>When are unbelievers bodily resurrected for judgment?</li>
	<li>Do unbelievers, according to a KJV, go to Hell after their bodily resurrection, or do they go to the Lake of Fire? (see Revelation 20:14-15)</li>
	<li>Who is Jesus warning about going to "Hell" in BODY, an unbeliever or a believer (Mark 9:47)?</li>
	<li>According to Jesus, to escape Hell is to enter the Kingdom of God in body (Mark 9:47). When does this Kingdom begin (see Luke 21:31)?</li>
	<li>When is the Last Day, mentioned by Jesus in reference to unbelievers in John 12:48?</li>
	<li>When did Jesus promise to raise up everyone who BELIEVES upon Him in John 6:40?</li>
	<li>Can you believe the Gospel, yet refuse to confess Jesus, and be a faithful believer? (see John 12:42, Matthew 10:30-32, 2 Timothy 2:12)</li>
	<li>Does Jesus have something more for believers who confess Him, live for Him, and suffer for Him? What is it?</li>
	<li>What is the "better resurrection" that many were tortured in order to receive in Hebrews 11:35?</li>
	<li>What is the "resurrection" that Paul suffered for, and for which he allowed himself to be made conformable to Christ's death in order to attain in Philippians 3:10-11?</li>
	<li>Is the Last Day the same as the Seventh Day in Hebrews 4:4-11?</li>
	<li>Since Jesus warned His disciples about the danger of going to "Hell" in soul and BODY (see Matthew 10:28), and since unbelievers only go to "Hell" in their SOUL before their resurrection, and since all unbelievers come out of "Hell" to stand at the Great White Throne, and are then cast into the Lake of Fire, was Jesus warning believers or unbelievers about going to "Hell" in their BODIES? Do modern Christians need to fear this warning?</li>
	<li>A believer can be made sick or killed by God in this life, and still possess everlasting life (John 3:16, 1 Corinthians 11:30). Where is the Bible verse that teaches that temporary chastisement in the age of the Millennial Kingdom would neutralize the promise of everlasting life, even though temporary chastisement in this life does not?</li>

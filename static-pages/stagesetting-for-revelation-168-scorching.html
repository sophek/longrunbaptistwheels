            "April 2002 Second Warmest on Record - Washington - Last month was the second warmest April on record worldwide, and was warmer and drier than usual for much of the United States. The conditions led to a worsening drought in parts of the United States, particularly the Southwest and many cities along the Eastern seaboard, the National Climatic Data Center reported Thursday. Overall it was the ninth warmest April on record for the United States at an average of 54.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the 48 contiguous states. That is 2.6 degrees above the 1895-2002 long-term average. Worldwide, preliminary data show the average land and ocean temperature in April was 56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, 1.03 degrees above the long-term average. That's the second warmest average since 1880. The warmest April worldwide was in 1998....'The past seven months have been the driest October through April on record in Colorado,' the report added, leading to numerous wildfires and concern that the 2002 wildfire season may be extremely busy....China was battling one of the worst droughts in decades, particularly in southeastern areas, with as many as 16 million people short of drinking water...."

"India heatwave toll rises to 622 despite rains - Hyderabad, India (Reuters) - The death toll from a heat wave in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh climbed to 622 Thursday, even as rains fell in some parts of the province, officials said....The heat wave is the worst in four years and comes ahead of the annual monsoon rains which usually first hit the southern coast of Kerala in June and spread across the rest of the country over the next three months. Officials said temperatures, which hit a peak of 118 degrees F. in the worst affected areas, had fallen in the past two days because of the rains, the first since March...." 

Comments: The new age globalists will attempt to capitalize on the increasing calamities. On the other hand, the worldly TV watching, beer-drinking, movie-going, over-fed, "Christianized" conservatives will hide their heads in the sand and pretend all is well. But let God's preachers stay steady on course and hold the line! The intense heat all over the world in these last few years is not a direct fulfillment of prophecy. However, is it not a WARNING that God may soon unleash the Tribulation Period upon the world? Will not God desire the people during the coming Tribulation to repent and TAKE HEED to His plagues and calamities and not despise them (Revelation 9:20, 16:9,11)? If this is so, then does it not make sense that when mankind is provided with a FOREWARNING of what is to come, that GOD'S PEOPLE should examine themselves, repent, and sound the alarm? There will indeed be many Hananiahs in these last days crying peace and safety. Yet, let us ignore these "Positive Mental Attitude" prophets. God has plainly warned us in regard to what will transpire in the last days, and we will not be silent in warning mankind: 

Jeremiah 28:8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.

â€œAUSTIN â€” Doctors would have to perform a sonogram at least two hours before an abortion and describe the fetus for the woman â€” including cardiac activity, internal organs and limbs â€” under a bill that sailed through theÂ <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Texas_Senate">Texas Senate</a> on Thursdayâ€¦Three Democrats voted for Senate Bill 16: Sens. Eddie Lucio of Brownsville,Â <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Carlos_Uresti">Carlos Uresti</a> of San Antonio andÂ <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Judith_Zaffirini">Judith Zaffirini</a> of Laredo. One Republican, Sen.Â <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Jeff_Wentworth">Jeff Wentworth</a> of San Antonio, voted against itâ€¦The bill was declared an emergency measure by Gov.Â <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Rick_Perry">Rick Perry</a>, allowing for its quick consideration. Perry praised the Senate approval and said he looks forward to speedy House action...

â€¦<strong>Under the bill, doctors would have to give women the option of viewing the sonogram and hearing the heartbeat, but they could refuse.Â A woman could refuse to hear the doctorâ€™s description of the sonogram, however, only under certain circumstances: if the pregnancy resulted from a crime, including sexual assault or incest; if the mother was a minor and obtaining the abortion under judicial bypass procedures allowing her to do so without parental consent; or if the fetus had an irreversible medical condition or abnormalityâ€¦</strong>Patrick several times made references to God, and in his closing comments quoted Scripture: â€œâ€‰â€™Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.â€™ He knows all of us.â€â€¦â€</blockquote>
The Bible teaches that pregnant women are â€œwith childâ€ (not â€œwith fetusâ€). Therefore, this bill is a start. The whole idea that our country has allowed baby killing in the womb is insanity. But at least this is something. Notice that the bill, in this version, allows the women to refuse VIEWING the sonogram, but it appears to mandate that she listen to the description of it. As for those politicians who love to spout off about the â€œrightsâ€ of women over their own bodies â€“ all you are doing is trying to give your own sick, vile weakness an appearance of morality. You are politicians who endorse murder, and that is how you will face God. Your spewings about a womanâ€™s right to her body are self-deception. Most of these same people believe in MANDATORY VACCINATIONS. And do these same pathetic politicians believe a woman (even teens, etc.) have a right to cut themselves? Harm themselves? They would call the police immediately. Why then do they believe a woman has the right to harm a baby in her womb? They will respond that the â€œlawâ€ maintains that the woman has to go to a â€œdoctorâ€ to get the abortion. But how does this change the argument? Would they fight for a teenâ€™s right to go to a doctor, for whatever reason even, and get euthanized? If not, then why not? What happened to all that drivel about a womanâ€™s â€œrightâ€ to her body? It is plain, she does not have the right to kill herself or her child. These politicians who scream about womenâ€™s rights are a bunch of hypocrites. In fact, they are worse. Jesus said that the people who delivered Him to Pilate HAD THE GREATER SIN. Therefore, the ones who make wicked, unjust, murderous laws, have the blood of babies on their hands. Are you listening? You better repent before God stirs Himself and you become a pile of ashes with your soul sinking down into Hell.

            MY RESPONSE TO KUTILEK'S "THE SPIRIT ITSELF REVISITED", Joey Faust

Mt.10:20: "for IT will not be you speaking, but the SPIRIT of your Father..." (NIV)

"IT is a hearty child..." (Alexander Bain, "A Higher English Grammar", 1879)

In response to my short article, Doug Kutilek writes:

"It is alleged by Mr. Faust that, 'the KJV is not bound by many of the narrow rules of grammar that men came up with in later generations.' Any acquaintance with the history of the English language would have informed that writer that in fact the English of 1600 was bound by many more conventions of grammar than is the English of today..."

It was never my point to deny that the English of the King James Bible is an exalted state of English; it certainly, in many ways, utilizes many more deep, technical rules of grammar than the language often used in modern times. My point, however, was to show that modern man (with TV, evolution, psychobabble and public education drenched in secular humanism) has arrogantly taken it upon himself to criticize the King James Bible based on NEW, modern, narrow rules of popular speech. One such narrow rule is that the Holy Spirit (the Third Person of the Godhead) can never, under ANY circumstances be called an "it." On the other hand, I believe that it is sometimes proper (especially under the rules of grammar used in rich, KJV English) to refer to the Holy Spirit as an "it." But we will let Kutilek argue this point for us. He writes:

"...the English of 1600 was bound by many more conventions of grammar than is the English of today."

Yes indeed! That is why the KJV translators knew it was NOT wrong, in the right context, and under the proper circumstances, to use the word "it" in reference to the Holy Spirit (especially when referring to His work in the intimate context of God's dear children).

Then again, notice some other examples that prove that today's popular English is, in fact, in SOME WAYS (all the wrong ways!), more narrow and confined than the English of the AV (especially in the definitions of words):

The KJV uses the word "mountains" to refer to the "hills" of Rome (Rev.17). Notice the only definition for "mountain" in Webster's 1845 dictionary:

"A large mass of earth and rock, rising above the common level of the earth or adjacent land, BUT OF NO DEFINITE ALTITUDE."

Webster's 1828 added:

"We apply 'mountain' to the largest eminences on the globe; but sometimes the word is used for a large hill."
The KJV uses the two words synonymously:

Luke 9:37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the HILL, much people met him.

2 Peter 1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy MOUNT.

Another example is the word "sea." The KJV uses it interchangeably with the word "lake":

Mark 5:13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the SEA, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the SEA.

Luke 8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the LAKE, and were choked.

Webster in 1845, defines "sea" as "a large body of water, nearly inclosed by land...."

Funk & Wagnall's, "A Standard Dictionary of the English language" (1895) defines "sea" as:

"...a large inland body of water; a large lake; rarely a small lake; as, the Caspian Sea; the Dead Sea; the Sea of Galilee. In a decision delivered at the October term, 1893, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Great Lakes were seas, in the legal sense of the term..."

Indeed, my point stands, that in SOME ways, modern, popular speech is much more constricted than KJV English. Notice some other examples.

In the English of the KJV, a "star" is something that is in the second heaven (i.e. space), such as a meteorite. A "fish" is something that swims in the water, such as a whale. A "fowl" is an animal that has wings and flies in the air, such as a bat. And an "it" is sometimes, in the right context, a person! Yet, the assumed rules of modern, popular language would never allow such things.

Therefore, when I say that modern language is much more "bound" by narrow rules than KJV English, I certainly do not mean that it is of a higher quality. KJV English is so rich and so deep, its words have fuller meanings and many more applications than the popular, degenerated language that is often in use today. My statement in the earlier article is therefore correct. Nevertheless, we are thankful that Kutilek has reminded us that KJV English has many more "conventions of grammar" than the English of this apostate age. This is obviously why it was NOT wrong for the KJV (and some earlier English translations) to refer to the Spirit, under the proper circumstances, as an "it."
But Kutilek continues:

"...the use of 'it' in Matthew 14, and the use of 'it' with reference to the Holy Spirit are two wholly distinct uses of 'it.' In Matthew 14, in each case, the 'it' with reference to Jesus is what grammarians call 'the anticipatory it of the deferred subject'."

We are happy to see these men relaxing a bit on their position. In their original objections to the KJV, they made as if it is ALWAYS improper to call a person an "it." Kutilek told us that it was even BLASPHEMY to refer to the Holy Spirit as an "it." Obviously, then, it would also be blasphemy to refer to Jesus Himself as an "it"! But now we are told that it is "sometimes" proper to use "it" for a person, even the LORD HIMSELF, if it is an "anticipatory it of the deferred subject." We take it, therefore, that Kutilek does not believe it is blasphemy to call Jesus an "it" if it is an "anticipatory it of the deferred subject." Therefore, their objection to the KJV's use of "it" in regard to the Holy Spirit should now be stated:

"Although it is sometimes proper to refer to a person, even God Himself, as an "it," it is not proper in Romans 8:16, etc."

Of course, if it is true (as Kutilek tells us) that KJV English "was bound by many more conventions of grammar than is the English of today," then I bet there are other times when it is proper to refer to a person (even God Himself) as an "it," other than the "anticipatory it of the deferred subject."

The "Oxford English Dictionary" certainly agrees. Under its definition for the word "it," it states:

"1. As the proper neuter pronoun of the third person sing. Used orig. instead of any neuter sb.;...1611 Bible Luke xi.14 And he was casting out a devil, and IT was dumbe...2.d. IT also occurs where HE, SHE, or THAT would now be preferred...V.13. As antecedent pronoun followed by relative expressed or understood...1611 Bible Isa. li.9 Art THOU not IT that hath cut Rahab?. 14. When the antecedent is the subject of a clause which precedes the relative, it may be used of persons as well as things."

"Webster's Practical Dictionary" (1884?) states:

"It is used, - as a demonstrative, pointing to that about to be stated, or referring to that which is well known..."

"Webster's New International Dictionary" (1950) states:
"It is NOW used only of an inanimate object or of an animate one in which sex is disregarded..."

"Samuel Johnson's English Dictionary" (1755) states:'

"'Sometimes applied FAMILIARLY, ludicrously, or rudely to PERSONS...It is sometimes used of the first or second person, sometimes of more."

Even today, in popular speech, we often use "it" to refer to a child (obviously a person), even when the gender IS known. This is common in KJV English (Ex.2:9, Ruth 4:16, Pr.20:11, etc.), and in the new versions:

2 Samuel 12:15 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and IT was very sick. (KJV)

2 Samuel.12:15: "....And the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and IT became very ill." (New King James Version)

1 Kings 3:19 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid IT. (KJV)

1 Kings 3:19: "And this woman's SON died in the night, because she lay on IT." (New American Standard Version)

1 Kings 3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, IT was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, IT was not my son, which I did bear. (KJV)

1 Kings 3:21: "...But when I looked at HIM closely in the morning light, I saw that IT wasn't the SON I had borne." (New International Version)

Based on the above examples alone, it must now be admitted that there are at least TWO times when it is proper to refer to a person as an "it." Various English dictionaries agree and tell us that "it" can be used of children, even when the gender is known (e.g. "The New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary," etc.). Therefore, the anti-KJV argument should now be phrased somewhat like the following:

"There are indeed times (plural!) when it is proper to refer to a person, even the Lord Himself, as an "it." And we do know that the rich, beautiful English of the KJV was much more complex than modern language. Nevertheless, it is STILL wrong, in all cases, under all circumstances, to refer to the Holy Spirit as an "it"!"

But if a child can be called an "it," is it not reasonable to conclude that in rich, KJV English, it is sometimes proper to refer to the Holy Spirit as an "it"? Some of the KJV translators could speak and write in multiple ancient languages as children! In God's Providence and grace, in regard to languages, they were wiser than seven modern scholars that can "render a reason"(Pr.26:16). To correct the King James Bible is to always ERASE some very important light.

I can already see one reason it would be beneficial, at times, to refer to the Holy Spirit as an "it." With more thought, I am sure other reasons would also manifest themselves. The Holy Spirit is indeed the Third Person of the Godhead. This is stated very clearly in 1 John 5:7 (at least in a KJV...). But the Third person of the Godhead is a SPIRIT:

Genesis 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the SPIRIT OF GOD moved upon the face of the waters.

New versions agree here. It is the Spirit "of God." Certainly it was also "God the Spirit." But the phrasing is "the Spirit of God." God later calls the Holy Spirit, "My Spirit":

Genesis 6:3 And the LORD said, MY SPIRIT shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

New versions agree. We therefore know that God has a Spirit. His Spirit happens to be a Member of the Godhead. Nevertheless, it is correct to say that God "has a Spirit":

1 John 4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of HIS SPIRIT.

1 Thessalonians 4:8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us HIS HOLY SPIRIT.

New versions agree.

The Holy Spirit is also called the Spirit "of Christ":

1 Peter 1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the SPIRIT OF CHRIST which was in them did signify, when IT testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

This is the supposed error of the KJV translators. They called the "Spirit of Christ" an "it" in 1 Peter 1:11. But isn't the Holy Spirit the Spirit "of Christ"? Isn't He "of God"? Why then would it be improper at times to call the Holy Spirit an "it"? The pronoun "He," used for the Spirit, shows the plurality in the Godhead. The KJV uses this at times (John 16:13, Rom.8:27). But there is more than just plurality in the Godhead. There is also UNITY. The Holy Spirit is God's Spirit. He is the Spirit "of God." He is called the Spirit "of Christ." He is not just God, He is also "of" God; He is the fullness of God's mind:

Numbers 11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the SPIRIT which is upon thee, and will put IT upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.

The Bible also refers to man's spirit as an "it":

Ec 12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the SPIRIT shall return unto God who gave IT.

New versions agree:

"...the SPIRIT will return to God who gave IT." (NASV)
New versions also refer to man's SOUL as an "it":

Psalm 35:9: "And my SOUL shall rejoice in the Lord; IT shall exult in His salvation." (NASV)

Psalm 119:175: "Let my SOUL live, and IT shall praise YOU..." (NKJV)

If it is wrong at times to refer to God's Own Spirit as an "it," why then do new versions refer to man's spirit as an "it"? Certainly God is much more complex than man. We know there are THREE that bear record in Heaven. Yet, man is made in the IMAGE of God (Gen.1:26). The KJV, by referring to the Holy Spirit as an "it," shows that He is not only the Third Person of the Godhead, He is in unity with God the Father. He is the Father's Own Spirit! The Bible itself makes the comparison in FUNCTION between God's Spirit and man's spirit:

1 Corinthians 2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the SPIRIT OF MAN which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the SPIRIT OF GOD.
16 For who hath known the MIND of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

And why do new versions at times use "it" to refer to UNCLEAN SPIRITS whose gender is always given as male?:

Luke 8:29: "For Jesus had commanded the evil SPIRIT to come out of the man. Many times IT had seized him..." (NIV)

1 John 4:3: "and every SPIRIT that does not confess Jesus is not from God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that IT is coming, and now IT is already in the world." (NAS)

If an unclean spirit, an unclean mind (Rom.8), the spirit of man and the soul of man can ALL properly be referred to by the word "it" in new versions, why then is it supposedly improper, at times, to refer to God's Own Spirit (which is a HOLY Spirit) by the word "it"? The spirit, soul, and mind of man are all a part of man, yet they are also the man himself. In the same manner, the Holy Spirit is not only the Third Person of the Godhead, He is the Spirit OF CHRIST. He is God's Spirit.

Kutilek claims that the KJV's use of "itself" to refer to the Holy Spirit is the "greatest defect" he can find! What a testimony to the perfection of the KJV! For these men will have to work much harder to prove "it" is an incorrect translation. The Spirit is not only God Himself and the Third Person of the Godhead; He is "of" God, in much the same way man's own "heart" is both himself and "of" himself:

Psalms 22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: MY HEART is like wax; IT is melted in the midst of my bowels.

Proverbs 18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that HIS HEART may discover ITSELF.

Proverbs 4:23 Keep THY HEART with all diligence; for out of IT are the issues of life.

Proverbs 21:1 The KINGS'S HEART is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth IT whithersoever he will.

Man's "heart" is certainly more the man himself than is his body. Man speaks to himself in his heart:

Ec 2:15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? THEN SAID I IN MY HEART, that this also is vanity.

1 Peter 3:4 But let it be the HIDDEN MAN OF THE HEART, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

Why do new versions repeatedly refer to man's heart as an "it"? Is not the heart of man, the man himself? Is man an "it"? Is not the Spirit, God Himself? Yet, is He not also God's "Spirit"?

Does not Jesus have a "spirit"?

Mark 8:12 And he sighed deeply in HIS SPIRIT, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.

Does not God have a SOUL?

Hebrews 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, MY SOUL shall have no pleasure in him.

Would it be improper to ever refer to His Soul as an "it"? Would it be improper, in a sermon, to say:

"God's soul is grieved when we add to His Word. IT has no delight in the arrogance or presumption of man."

Would this use of "it" be improper? I trow not.

God also has a Spirit:

Isaiah 42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom MY SOUL delighteth; I have put MY SPIRIT upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

Matthew 12:18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom MY SOUL is well pleased: I will put MY SPIRIT upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

Isaiah 34:16 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and HIS SPIRIT IT hath gathered them.

Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST,

        <h1> THERE IS NO REAL SCHOLAR ANYWHERE WHO BELIEVES SUCH A THING!</h1>

            "There is no real scholar anywhere who believes such a thing!"

When did God say that all the latter day scholars would recognize His perfect, preserved words? He didn't. In fact, He never even promised that most of them would recognize it. Christ told us to beware of scribes (Lu.20:46). The Bible promises a great falling away in the last days (2Thess.2:3, 2Tim.3:1-5). In light of these observations, the very fact that not many modern, popular scholars embrace KJV Onlyism is actually one of the best arguments for it!

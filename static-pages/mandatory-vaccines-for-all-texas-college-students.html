        <h1>MANDATORY VACCINES FOR ALL TEXAS COLLEGE STUDENTS?</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <blockquote><a href="http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/higher-education/battle-brewing-over-mandatory-meningitis-vaccine/">http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/higher-education/battle-brewing-over-mandatory-meningitis-vaccine/</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>â€œâ€¦Earlier this month, 20-year-old Nicolis Williams, an economics major atÂ <a href="http://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, died after falling ill with bacterial meningitis. In Texas, students who live in college dormitories are required to be vaccinated against meningitis. Williams lived off campus â€” and he wasnâ€™t vaccinated. Since his death, Williamsâ€™ parents have been pushing lawmakers to close that gap by requiring all college students be vaccinated, and lawmakers are lining up to do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>State Rep.Â <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/directory/charlie-howard/">Charlie Howard</a>, R-Sugar Land, in whose district the Williams family lives, says he is drafting such a bill. Other lawmakers have already filed similar legislation. State Rep.Â <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ron-reynolds/">Ron Reynolds</a>, D-Missouri City, andÂ <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/directory/byron-cook/">Byron Cook</a>, R-Corsicana,Â <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=HB1557">submitted theirs</a> on Monday. In the upper chamber, state Sen.Â <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/directory/wendy-davis/">Wendy Davis</a>, D-Fort Worth, says she plans to file legislation because, she says, â€œWe feel that the law today is a little too limited.â€</blockquote>
<blockquote>â€¦â€œWe were definitely opposed to it last session,â€ says Dawn Richardson, the president ofÂ <a href="http://www.vaccineinfo.net/">Parents Requesting Open Vaccine Education</a>, an Austin-based group opposed to mandatory vaccines and in favor of informing families and letting them decide. But the group opted to remain quiet. Now that the requirement may be extended, she says families who remained silent last time are determined to make themselves heard. This weekâ€™s Supreme Court decision has only motivated them more. â€œWe have to fight all mandates,â€ Richardson says, â€œbecause we have no recourse.â€â€¦â€</blockquote>
Here we go again with the Nazi-style forced â€œmedicationâ€ so Big Pharma companies can rake in more money. Even the people that are the most blind about all of this, should admit that every vaccine contains toxins and other trash that places the victim at risk of sickness, or worse. Should any American be forced to be vaccinated? â€“ Forced to take such a risk? Should America legalize a system where drug companies can require people to take their dope? Wake up people. Wake up Christians. What happened to living clean (morally and physically), and learning about things like colloidal silver, cinnamon oil, clove oil, garlic, olive leaf, mints, and other Bible healers? What we do NOT need is a bunch of dope pushers, shooting toxins in our bloodstream at a protection in case we get sick later! The snake oil salesmen of ages ago, had better sense. At least we finally proved that many of their claims were actually true!

WHY I SMASHED THEATER PICTURE MACHINES WITH A SLEDGE HAMMER,
By Wallace Memmer, Randleman, N.C., 1942
************************************************************************
The following letter was published in Asheboro, N.C.'s "Courier-Tribune"
in 1942. Wallace Memmer (a born again Christian) spent two years in prison
for smashing movie projectors. His letter was written from the County Jail
at Asheboro, NC, while he was awaiting trial. While most people did not
endorse his specific actions, his hatred against Hollywood sin was
applauded by most fundamental Christian leaders in his day. It is not my
intention at this point to enter into whether or not his "sledgehammer
ministry" was Biblical. But there is one point that I would like to stress
to the reader's conscience as he or she reads this letter from Memmer. How
is it that Memmer could have so much hatred against the sin in the MOVIES
IN HIS EARLY DAY, that he was moved to actually SMASH PROJECTORS with a
sledge hammer, yet Christian pastors TODAY, are so effeminate and passive,
that they will THEMSELVES gaze at MODERN movies, which contain a HUNDRED
TIMES the amount of outright fornication, gore, blasphemy, and filthy
language? Selah! Why is it that this man was so moved that he was willing
to go to jail for two years to protest the FILTH in the movies OF THE
EARLY FORTIES, yet, modern pastors WILL NOT SO MUCH AS ISSUE A STATEMENT
FROM THE PULPIT THAT HOLLYWOOD MOVIES ARE OF THE DEVIL? We are told that
our weapons are spiritual and not carnal. Well then, where are the
spiritual weapons? Where is the reproving and rebuking by the Scriptures?
Where is the fervent praying against the SPECIFIC sin that has neutralized
our churches? The answer is that we are living in the days when men are
"lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God" (2 Timothy 3). Laodicea is
so self-confident of its practical holiness before God, that she thinks
she does not NEED to separate from filth and evil communications (1
Corinthians 10:12, 15:33). Laodicea "sits a queen" and she prides herself
that "she is no legalist." She has so interpreted grace that she thinks
she will "see no evil" for such vile communications. And anyone who warns
her that she will indeed see evil, is called a "heretic." She does not
realize that she is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
naked, and that the Lord will soon SPUE her out of His mouth (Revelation
3:16). But enough of me. Let us now hear some excerpts from Memmer's jail
letter:

"Fellow Citizens:
Since many people do not understand my apparently outlandish action in
wrecking, with a sledge-hammer, the moving picture machines in the Fox
theatre at Randleman, N.C., on Saturday afternoon, April 4, 1942, I feel
constrained to inform the public as to why I did so. I hope that before
you finish reading this article, you shall have realized that I am not
insane, dishonest, dangerous, or criminal, but that I have acted in accord
with and in defense of the law, and for the protection of our children,
our homes, our churches, our government and everything that Americans hold
dear. I shall now give you:

...Major Reasons Why I Smashed the Moving Picture Machines at Randleman,
N.C.:

-The movies are operating contrary to the Supreme law of our land. The
very highest judicial authority, the Supreme Court of our nation, has made
a most radical ruling, to wit: 'No legislature can bargain away the public
health or the public morals. The people themselves cannot do it, much less
the servants. The government is organized with a view to their
preservation and cannot divest itself of the power to provide them.' 101
VS 816. No state, therefore, can license or legalize immorality, vice or
crime. All such efforts are treason to society, and rebellion against
organized government. Again, the Supreme Court of the United States has
declared: 'If the public safety or the public morals requires the
discontinuance of any manufacture or traffic, the hand of the legislature
cannot be stayed from providing for its discontinuance, by any incidental
inconvenience which individuals or corporations may suffer.' 97 US 32....

-Reliable statistics show that the movies are destroying the public
morals, and actually producing multitudes of criminal boys and girls,
women and men. Movies destroy self-control, thus producing drunkards, dope
fiends, spend thrifts, shiftless wanderers, thieves, adulterers,
fornicators, liars, gamblers, and what not. About half of the inmates of
jails, reformatories and penitentiaries  hold the movies at least partly
responsible for their crimes. The American films are not only about
wickedness, they favor wickedness. They not only show nudity, but they
show it as desirable. They not only show crime, but they teach that crime
pays! They not only show criminals, but they show them as brave men and
women, in romantic, adventure-loving, admirable people, who after all, are
not so bad. In an analysis of 40 pictures, in which 57 criminals committed
62 crimes, only 7 of the criminals were punished by the law. Only about
one fifth of the criminals in the films receive legal punishment. Many go
'Scott free' from all kinds of crime. Is it any wonder that our crime bill
now costs is 100 dollars per person, or about 13 billion dollars annually?
And the end is not yet. We have JUST BEGUN TO REAP THE CRIMINAL ACTS FROM
THE WICKED THOUGHTS, which have been sown in the minds of moving picture
show goers for the past 25 years....

-Common law has always granted the individual citizen the right to destroy
a public nuisance. I Bishop's Criminal Law, 828; I Hillard on Torts, 605:
'At common law it is always the right of a citizen, without official
authority, to abate a public nuisance, and without waiting to have it
adjudged, such by a legal tribunal. His right to do so depends on the fact
of its being a nuisance....It is simply the prevention of its noxious and
unlawful use, and depends upon the principles that every man must so use
his property as not to injure his neighbors, and that the safety of the
public is the paramount law.' These principles are legal maxims or axioms
essential to the existence of regulated society. Written constitutions
presuppose them, are subordinate to them, and cannot set them
aside.'...Bishop on Criminal Law, paragraph 1081: 'This doctrine of
abatement of a public nuisance by an individual, is an expression of the
better instincts of our natures, which lead men to watch over and shield
one another from harm.' Carrie Nation, the woman who carried on a smashing
crusade against the saloons, in the first decade of this century, acted
under the above recognized authority....Judge Baker summed up the case of
Carrie Nation's accusers thus: 'The women who destroyed such property, are
not criminals. They have the right to abate such common nuisances as men
have to defend their persons or domiciles, when unlawfully assailed. It
think they are filly justified, morally and legally in protecting their
homes, their families, and themselves from the ravages of the demons of
vice in the summary manner which the law permits.' If the people of this
generation don't wake up, they will receive judgment as ELI did....Oh
people, WE ARE GOING TO REAP DESTRUCTION, because of our cowardly dealing
with sin. Parents fail to punish their children, husbands do not restrain
their wives, preachers do not judge sin in the lives of their church
members, the law is lenient toward many kinds of crime.

The motives of the men who own the Moving Picture Industry are,
enslavement of the masses, destruction of religion, love of money, desire
for notoriety, and thirst for power. They have so designed their films as
to sow seeds of religious hate, social hate, racial hate, industrial hate,
revolution, inter-racial misunderstanding and war. The producers have
deliberately and maliciously over-emphasized an appeal to the base, the
depraved, the sexual, and to all crime, in order to corrupt society and
the civilized world....They scorn ordinary methods of living, and teach
money-making by gambling, thieving, trickery, and harlotry. They despise
faithfulness in marriage and home life....True, there are a few good
pictures; [but] these are shown SO THAT THE PUBLIC WILL REMAIN DECEIVED in
thinking the movies ARE NECESSARY AND EDUCATIONAL.....the sad truth is
that they are in the wrong hands....EVEN THE GOOD PICTURES ARE PLAYED BY
PEOPLE UNFIT TO BE EXAMPLES. The overwhelming majority of actors and
actresses are immoral, and still MILLIONS ARE SEEKING TO IMITATE THEM in
manner, in conversation, in style, and conduct. Seeking ennobling and
constructive entertainment at the movies today is like hunting for
healthy, sanitary food in a garbage can; or as someone else has said, 'tis
like seeking recreation in the fresh air, by riding down the sewer in a
glass-bottomed boat!' People who frequent the movies have...developed the
SWINE'S APPETITE....

The movies are directly opposed to the law of God as revealed in the
Bible. They call evil good, and good evil.... The movie, is by far, the
most outstanding, gigantic enemy of the church. It is the GOLIATH....IF WE
CHRISTIANS DON'T AROUSE our sleepy minds and hearts, and with the sling of
prayer and faiths and the smooth stones of action, protest...DESTROY THIS
GREAT GIANT OF SIN, WE ALONE WILL BE TO BLAME when our pastors are
butchered, our churches destroyed, and we find ourselves slaughtered,
tortured, and imprisoned by the armies of these modern day, Atheistic
Philistines. OH WHAT SHAME THAT WE SHOULD LET OUR ENEMIES DEFY US FOR SO
LONG....

God usually goes the limit in warning the nations before He brings
DESTRUCTION to them....Never dying soul, if you don't clean up the temple
of your body, you'll be destroyed like the temple at Jerusalem. God wants
each heart and mind to be His house of prayer, where the individual lives
in fellowship and harmony with Him....Out of their hearts are pouring
cursing, lustful thoughts...etc. People are pouring unnecessary rich,
concentrated foods, drinks, tobacco and dope into their bodies, which have
become their masters. Their bodies rule their minds and wills, rather than
their minds and wills ruling their lustful bodies. They have made gods of
their bellies...They have no capacity, no time, no energy for God. As
Jesus said, their hearts are overcharged with surfeiting (over-eating)....

THE MOVIES ARE HASTING THE JUDGMENT OF GOD UPON AMERICA. WE MUST DESPISE
THEM, OR FORFEIT OUR LIBERTIES, OUR BLESSINGS, OUR LIVES, AND OUR SOULS.
We must quit feasting on natural filth and soul poison as seen in moving
pictures. The Bible condemns all who do so, when it says, '...whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any
praise, think on these things.' [Philippians 4]. The movies fill people's
minds with everything that grieves God." [End of Letter].

COMMENTS:      
Please lay aside, for the moment, your views of Memmer's "sledge-hammer
ministry." He reasoned that if Jesus could drive out the moneychangers
with a whip (more than once), he figured he could (and should) bust up a
few movie projectors in his town. I believe that fathers and husbands
SHOULD INDEED follow Memmer's example IN THEIR OWN HOMES! They should
"sledgehammer" the "Devil's Window," out of which he sticks his serpentine
head into the living rooms of Christians and baptizes them in the bluish
glow of his nightly, hellish sermons. They should "sledgehammer" that
vile, stinking connection with the world's filth that ruins marriages,
makes rebels, gluttons, and perverts of children. Unless you want your son
or grandson to be a sodomite, you had better repent, take a stand, and
begin to WARN the flock! If Christians viewed the movies in the FORTIES
this bad, how does the Holy Spirit feel about the MODERN MOVIES AND
TELEVISION SHOWS?

ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON THE R-RATED, ROMAN CATHOLIC MOVIE
**********************************************************************

We are getting very close to the time when tens of thousands of
Christians, and professing Christians, led by their pastors and priests,
will view the R-rated, Roman Catholic Jesus movie (it begins playing
February 25th). The following things will occur, or they are occurring
already:

1. Christians who before had a little conscience left, and were convicted
about R-rated movies will now feel justified, since their pastor
recommended the R-rated "Jesus" movie.

2. Thousands of preachers' wives and daughters will gaze upon a Catholic
"movie star," who will be half-naked, as he pretends to be Jesus. They
will view this half-naked "star" CLOSE UP, in gory violence, with the
smiling approval of their pastor (husband, father, etc.), even though the
Christian women in the Bible viewed most of the crucifixion event
(concerning the real Jesus) AFAR OFF:

Matthew 27:55 And many women were there BEHOLDING AFAR OFF, which followed
Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

Mark 15:40 There were also women LOOKING ON AFAR OFF...

3. Thousands of Christian pastors are embracing Mel Gibson as a "great
evangelist," yet Gibson is a traditionalist Catholic who believes that
everyone who is NOT A ROMAN CATHOLIC is damned to eternal fire. Has a
single evangelical preacher asked the man whether or not he thinks ROME
was in ERROR for killing millions of Christians? Does he believe that
people should be put to death for doctrinal reasons? His movie is meant to
win people to CATHOLICISM, not Christianity:

"Despite its R rating - for gruesome scenes of Christ's scourging and
crucifixion - youth ministers say they plan to take classes of teenagers
to screenings of the film....'It's the best evangelization opportunity
we've had since the actual death of Jesus,' said Lisa Wheeler of Atlanta,
associate editor of Catholic Exchange, a Web portal dedicated to Internet
evangelism....When St. Peter Chanel Catholic Church of Roswell and St.
Brigid Catholic Church of Alpharetta reserved 1,500 seats for two Feb. 23
showings, they were told that 40 other churches had competed for the same
time slot....Catholic Exchange has prepared a book-length guide to 'The
Passion' and is printing 100,000 copies, along with an 'evangelization'
plan that will be offered to the 100 churches of the Atlanta Archdiocese.
Eventually it will be used nationwide, expects editor Tom Allen." (Atlanta
Journal Constitution, Feb. 5th, 2004)

4. The movie will possibly contain doctrines of devils, and likely much
that is false:

"According to Mel Gibson, he was partly inspired to create this epic movie
because of the book, 'The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ.' The
book is based on the visions of a Catholic mystic - Venerable Anne
Catherine Emmerich and tells the story of the Passion in much more detail
than that found in the Bible. The book also contains a brief life of this
mystic who will be beatified by the Pope in the near
future."(aquinasandmore.com)

NEWS REPORT: BILLBOARDS TARGET CHRISTIAN PORN ADDICTS
*******************************************************************

"Billboards Target Christian Porn Addicts - DALLAS - Chocolates are always
nice, and a diamond necklace would be delightful. But a Dallas-based
ministry thinks it has a better idea for Valentine's Day. 'Her gift for
Valentines? Stop looking at porn,' proclaim billboards put up by
NetAccountability, a nonprofit software company that aims to help
Christians confront the 'secret sin' of pornography. If national surveys
are any indication, it is a personal battle waged by millions of
Christians. Almost 18 percent of people who called themselves born-again
Christians admitted visiting Internet porn sites, according to a 2000
survey of 1,031 adults by the evangelical group Focus on the Family. In a
2002 Pastors.com survey, more than 50 percent of responding pastors
reported viewing pornography in the previous year....The billboards have
been going up in Dallas over the past few days. 'I've seen pornography
impact guys all around me,' Cotter said. 'I've seen it tear up marriages,
guys losing their jobs, all over the board. In a lot of cases, they were
Christian guys going to church, with otherwise 'normal lives.' Bernie
Anderson, a pastor at Seventh-Day Adventist churches in the Dallas area,
said an addiction to sexually explicit images threatened his marriage and
his ministry. 'It was like a double life,' said Anderson, 33. For 20
years, he found himself drawn to pornographic Web sites, movies and
magazines, he said. He would get up at night, telling his wife he needed
to study, and would surf the Internet for porn. Later, he would spend
hours accessing porn sites from the computer in his church office....Last
summer, the guilt and shame finally became too much for him to bear, he
said....Anderson learned how his habit kept him from true intimacy in his
relationship with his wife, he said. Recently, he celebrated '100 days
sober' from porn, he said...." (AP, February 12, 2004)

COMMENTS: If you are in the slightest degree tempted to view evil things
on a computer, then you MUST do one of the following things (unless you
like death and destruction):

1. Get rid of your computer or Internet immediately. Send us your address
and we will try to send you the Kingdom Alert in hardcopy format.

2. Get software IMMEDIATELY that will keep you 100 percent accountable to
someone.

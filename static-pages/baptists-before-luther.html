        <h1>BAPTISTS BEFORE LUTHER - KAU#118</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "The modern Baptists formerly called Anabaptists are the only people that never symbolized with the Papacy." -Isaac Newton

The name "Anabaptist" was a name given to Bible believers by their enemies. This is why early "Baptist" groups sometimes rejected the name. For example, Thieleman J. van Braght writes in 1659:

"The name 'Anabaptist' was really not accepted by them by choice or desire, but of necessity..." ("The Martyr's Mirror")

Henry C. Vedder writes:

"In the first Confession of Faith issued by the Particular Baptists in 1644, the churches that published the document described themselves, 'as commonly (but unjustly) called Anabaptists.'...They had never chosen the name Anabaptist, and had always maintained that it was not properly applied to them." ("A Short History of the Baptists," 1892, pp.3, 184)

In fact, when John Clarke, the great Baptist forefather, was persecuted in America for Baptist views, he stated:

"...in our examination the Governor upbraided us with name Anabaptists; to whom I answered I disdain the name; I am neither an Anabaptist nor a Pedobaptist, nor a Catabaptist...he told me in haste I was all." (p.31, "Ill Newes From New England," 1652)

The term "Anabaptist" means "re-baptizer." Since "Baptist" believers reject infant sprinkling, they do not see the immersion of a believer as a second baptism.

When Catholics and other groups demand to see "Baptists" before Luther, they are often looking for the NAME. But the believers who practiced immersion and rejected infant baptism were persecuted. They became the victims of the bloody Inquisition. To look for the history of "Baptists" in the Dark Ages, one must look for the persecuted Christians who denied infant baptism, rejected the Pope's authority, declared Rome to be the Whore of Babylon, denied Purgatory and prayers to the dead, and declared that the Scriptures were the final authority, and were SLANDERED as occultists, etc. The early Baptists will be found in such groups as the Albingenses and Waldenses.

The enemies of the ancient Baptists have ironically helped established the fact of their existence throughout history! One opponent of the Baptists, Henry Bullinger (1504-1575) writes:

"Now, I think it not labour lost to speak somewhat of anabaptism. In the time that Decius and Gallus Caesar were Emperors, there arose a question in the parts of Africa of rebaptising heretics; and St. Cyprian, and the rest of the Bishops, being assembled together in the council of Carthage, liked well of anabaptism... Against the Donatists St. Augustine, with other learned men, disputed. There is also an Imperial Law made by Honorius and Theodosius, that holy Baptism should not be iterated repeated. Justinian Caesar hath published the same, in Cod. lib. I. Tit. 6, in these words. 'If any Minister of the Catholic Church be detected to have rebaptised any, let both him which committed the unappeasable offence, (if at least by age he be punishable) and he, also, that is won and persuaded thereunto, suffer punishment of death.'" (Henry Bullinger, "Sermons on the Sacraments," Cambridge, University Press for T. Stevenson, London, 1811, pp. 186, 187) "The Martyr's Mirror" (1660), concerning the ancient edict against Anabaptists, writes "As those Christians greatly increased who valued only the baptism which is administered upon faith, and consequently rebaptized (as not having been baptized aright) those who had been baptized by unbelievers or in infancy, when they attained to the true faith, the Emperor Theodosius, A.D. 413, issued an edict, against the Anabaptists, commanding that they should be put to death." (p.190)

And perhaps the best testimony that could be demonstrated is provided by Catholic Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius (President of the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1564, designated by Pope Paul IV). He once stated:

"Were it not that the Baptists have been grievously tormented and cut off with the knife during the past twelve hundred years, they would swarm in greater number than all the Reformers." (Housius, Letters Apud Opera, pp.112,113; "The Trail of Blood" )

"The Anabaptists are a pernicious sect of which kind the Waldensian brethren seem to have been although some of them lately, as they testify in their apology, declare that they will no longer re-baptize, as was their former custom; nevertheless, it is certain that many of them retain their custom, and have united with the Anabaptists." (Hosius, Works of the Heresatics of our Times, Bk. I. 431. Ed. 1584; John T. Christian in "A History of the Baptists").

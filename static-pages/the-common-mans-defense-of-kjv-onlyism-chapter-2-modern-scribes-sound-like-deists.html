            CH. 2 - MODERN SCRIBES SOUND LIKE DEISTS

Nature is only a partial revelation. Nevertheless, it is able to reveal a great deal about God. From looking at the material universe, we can know that there is a Creator. We can know that this Creator appears to be omnipotent, with a love for beauty and order. This partial revelation of nature leads us onward, in search of another, more direct source of communication from our Creator. We find this direct revelation of God in the Christian bible. This bible professes to be the "Word of God." To back up its claim, it presents us with supernatural, internal unity and miraculously fulfilled prophecy. Furthermore, it demonstrates its Divine power by convicting sinners, transforming lives and impacting the world. Nature is a steppingstone to finding this direct revelation of God in the bible:

Psalms 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

Romans 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

Nature, when examined by a seeking, reasonable person leads one to search for further revelation of God. There are many books and religious writings that either profess to be, or are held to be, Divinely inspired. Nevertheless, only the Christian bible shines with infallible proof of supernatural inspiration that can be verified by the objective mind.

Yet, the seeking soul will not end his search here. The path from nature, to religious books, to the Christian bible is indeed a journey from obscurity into radiant light. However, it would be irresponsible not to search for an even brighter light than this. Which Christian bible is the perfect revelation of God?

It is obvious that an Atheist is in the darkest position. He has stubbornly ignored the basic, primary testimony of nature. In the next position of spiritual obscurity is the Deist. Deists believe that nature is the only light needed by man in his search for God and His truth. They admit that the natural world proves the existence of God. Yet, they are unwilling to seek a more direct revelation of God to man. In almost the same degree of blindness as the Deists, lie those who admit the possibility of further communication by God, yet attempt to find it in a devilish source. There are many religious writings that try to imitate the true revelation of God in the Christian bible. However, these all lack any objective evidence of Divine inspiration. The man who places his trust in the Christian bible is the man with the clearest light, for he is able to read the true words of God.

Even so, such a man has not entirely freed himself from subjective shadows. The seeking soul will continue on the path from darkness to light. The Devil tries to keep such souls contented with a less than perfect revelation so they will not continue on the trail of true reason. Why not just sit back and enjoy nature? Isn't the sunset breathtaking? Why find out more? The seeking soul cannot settle for such obscurity. He needs more. He must argue from nature to the wonderful Christian bible itself. And even here, he must seek the one, perfect Christian Bible above the rest. The Devil will try to keep the seeking soul from taking this final step into KJV Onlyism. If the Devil cannot keep him in the obscurities of natural religion, he will settle for keeping him entangled in the obscurities of textual variants. Is the last part of Mark 16 the Word of God? What about Mark 7:16, 9:44,46, 11:26, and 15:28? What about Mt.17:21, 18:11, and 23:14?

Once a person knows that the Christian bible is the real Word of God, it is now time to seek a brighter, more polished light. With obscurity and darkness there is great potential for sin and error. Yet, fullness of truth brings power. What is the next step? One simply needs to ask whether or not God has decided to communicate to man in a more direct manner through only one Christian Bible. One Bible, without any errors, would be the clearest, brightest light imaginable in this world! Imagine if the Christian had only one final, written authority as his standard. This would remove all confusion over which translation, copy or version of the Christian bible was God's exact communication to man. It is true that any Christian bible (in any language) is a clearer revelation of God than nature alone. On the other hand, a perfect Bible that stands out among the rest would be the clearest revelation of all. KJV critics will deny the need for this clearer revelation. They claim that a multitude of imperfect copies of scripture is sufficient enough. Why seek more light?

Earlier Christians overturned the dreamy, confident world of Deism by pointing out the obscurities of nature. Likewise, KJV Onlyists manifest the obscurities in the position of KJV critics. Is 1 John 5:7 the Word of God?:

1 John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

What about Acts 8:37?:

Acts 8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

Both of these verses, as found in the KJV, are missing from many other Christian bibles. 1 John 5:7 is a clear proof that God is three, yet one (i.e. the Trinity), and Acts 8:37 proves that a person must believe before he or she is baptized in water (therefore disproving both baptismal regeneration and infant baptism). It is important to know whether or not God inspires these verses! There are thousands of examples such as these. With one, perfect, infallible Bible, all such obscurities vanish away. With an absolute standard, Christians can spend time studying what God means instead of trying to figure out what He did or did not say to begin with!

Older generations of Christians had to contend with Atheists and Deists. Deists believed in God, yet denied the need of a more perfect revelation of His will. Today, this old debate continues on the next level. KJV Onlyists contend that the KJV is the standard above the rest. It is the Bible to which all other Christian bibles point. Almost every Christian bible contains enough of God's words to plainly see that there are promises by Him to preserve His words from corruption. Where is this preserved Bible? Furthermore, it is disobedience not to seek the highest form of written revelation imaginable. A Bible without one mistranslation or copy error is the highest form of written revelation possible. The seeking soul must search for this one Christian Bible that is perfect above the rest. If he will not content himself with nature alone, why should he content himself with a multitude of conflicting Christian bibles that contain copy errors or mistranslations? Why should he have to examine many different Christian bibles to try to piece together what God is saying? It is true that searching many different, imperfect Christian bibles is a better, brighter source of light than simply nature alone. Nevertheless, it is still a less than perfect communication of God's will to man. Why stop? Why not seek for the fullest revelation possible?

It is here that the KJV critics will raise their voices in protest. They will contend that it is not necessary to seek for anything brighter than the multitude of imperfect copies of the bible. They will pretend that they "see" adequately enough without one, perfect Bible. They will claim that all of the "important doctrines" are visible. They will therefore comfort the seeking soul and try to get him to settle down and forsake his quest for a perfect revelation in one Book.

Any argument put forth by the KJV critic will be of the same nature as those put forth by Deists, centuries ago. James R. White writes:

"The simple fact of the matter is that no textual variants in either the Old or New Testaments in any way, shape, or form materially disrupt or destroy any essential doctrine of the Christian faith."1

James White is saying that regardless of the thousands of variations between conflicting Christian bibles, there is no reason to seek the clearer light of one, perfect Bible. The early Deists made the same claims concerning nature:

"The crucial question, therefore, was whether natural religion was sufficient. The Deists said Yes; the Christians said No."2

To maintain the sufficiency of nature as a revelation, the Deists mocked the Christian scriptures and pretended to find great mistakes and inconsistencies therein. This is exactly how KJV critics respond today. They hold that the multitudes of imperfect copies are a reliable revelation, and they ridicule the KJV as a brighter revelation of God. Many Deists wrote books deriding the Christian scriptures. They claimed that educated, rational men could never overlook such obvious inconsistencies as those found within the Christian bible. Likewise, today, the KJV critics maintain that all of the educated, skilled scholars believe the KJV has errors. In fact, these so-called scholars believe that all manuscripts and bibles have errors. They seek to keep people bound to the obscure shadows of a "multitude of imperfect copies," the same way the early Deists sought to entangle their victims in the dark shadows of nature.

The Deists spent much time praising the orderly laws of nature. They claimed that these natural laws give mankind the only revelation he needs to live morally before God. In the same way, the modern KJV critic spends much time praising the "reliability" of the multitude of biblical copies. He will not seek one, perfect Book.

It is reasonable and proper for a person to use a partial, indirect revelation to light the way toward a greater, clearer revelation. If it is proper to use nature to seek for further revelation, then it is proper to use the multitude of imperfect, biblical copies, versions and translations as a steppingstone to seek for the one, perfect Bible. They all promise, to some degree, that God would preserve His words. They all reveal God as powerful and able to preserve His words. They all show that God is serious about His holy words. It is therefore reasonable to believe that God would fulfill His promises and preserve His words in one, perfect Bible.

Nature reveals there is a Creator. The multitudes of Christian bibles reveal that God is able and committed to preserving His words. The logical question for the seeking soul with only the revelation of nature is, Has God communicated in a clearer manner? The logical question for the seeking soul with only a multitude of conflicting Christian bibles is the same: Has God communicated in a clearer manner? In other words, has God insured that the inspired words of the originals would be preserved to absolute perfection for the last days?

Again, any argument against the KJV as God's perfect Bible would also be an argument that the early Deists could use against the Christians in regard to the scriptures in general. Yet, no honest argument can ever be brought forth against God speaking to man through His scriptures (as found within any version, translation, copy, etc.). Likewise, there is no honest argument against God speaking to man in perfect, preserved Scriptures.

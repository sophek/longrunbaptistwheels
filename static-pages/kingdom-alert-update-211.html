THE JOSIAH REVOLUTION: RESTORING THE OLD PATHS

Psalms 106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
we have done wickedly.

Revolution: "Motion backward." (Webster's 1828)

It is sad that so many of our churches are so greatly influenced by this
world, instead of being a light to it:

Romans 12:2 And be not CONFORMED TO THIS WORLD: but be ye transformed by
the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

On one side, we are living in the days of relaxation, cowardice and
retreat. Nothing must go against the grain of degeneration. The message of
the hour is: "There is enough to worry about; let the kids alone. We had
boyfriends and girlfriends, and we turned out okay." We might replace the
first part of the last sentence with any number of issues. But when did
simply turning out "okay" become the goal of CHRISTIAN living?
Furthermore, FORNICATION before marriage (and the other sins that so many
"Christian daters" commit in this age of Clintonian doublespeak) has been
RAMPANT for decades. Therefore, the past few generations cannot be called
"okay." For this reason, instead of DEFENDING the corrupt,
landmark-removing, fence-breaking, provision-for-sin-making,
foundation-crumbling, traditions of man that produced such rotten fruit in
so many people's lives, it is the responsibility of older generations
today (i.e. ages 30 to 100) to REPUDIATE such worldly practices in shame.

Today, there are certainly many wise, aged men and women who are bringing
forth fruits meet for repentance, who are helping young people today to
escape the disasters of their own generation. Yet, there are others who
are perplexed, hurt, and confounded: "This didn't hurt US. You are going
overboard." But there is no reason for confusion. The Bible itself reveals
to us that after generations of great rebellion and flirtation with evil,
when dreadful consequences finally ripen, God often awakens a remnant who
attempt to restore the old paths:

Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
for the OLD PATHS, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall
find rest for your souls...

Jeremiah 18:15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned
incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from
THE ANCIENT PATHS, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;

For example, the king of Judah moved with fear after realizing how he and
his fathers had drifted away from God's commanding will:

2 Kings 22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
have FOUND the book of the law in the house of the LORD...
11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of
the law, that he rent his clothes.
13 [And the king said] ...great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled
against us, because OUR FATHERS have not hearkened unto the words of this
book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.

God assured the king that He was indeed angry and ready to judge! But
Josiah FEARED the Lord's warnings. He launched a revival of Godly fear.
And based on the tenderness of the king's heart, God graciously POSTPONED
His judgment:

2 Kings 22:19 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled
thyself...I also have heard thee...

What many "priests of the high places" (2 Kings 23:20) today would despise
as a hard heart in Josiah, God called a TENDER heart. King Josiah, with
his "tender heart," does not waste any time in restoring the "old paths":

2 Kings 23:7 And he brake down the houses of the SODOMITES, that were by
the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.

In the first chapter of my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?," I reveal
that many Christians expected a revival of the FEAR OF GOD among a remnant
of Christians in the last days before the Tribulation Period. For example,
fundamental Baptist preacher, W. F. Roadhouse (1875-1951), once wrote:

"We are glad to be counted amongst the rapidly growing number of writers
who are doing pioneer work in teaching the Scriptural, searching message
of a deeper Personal Responsibilityâ€¦.Forever suppressed these truths will
not be - The Holy Ghost is pressing them even now upon believers
every-where.....God shake us up. When Revival comes we shall see this
[kingdom-accountability] truth again!"

There are many areas (not always connected) where accountability is being
restored among seeking Christians. One example is in Biblical child
training (e.g. the popularity of material by the Pearl's, etc.). Thousands
of Christians are returning to the old-fashioned teaching about "not
sparing the rod," tempered with consistency; without harsh provocations.
And there have been many new books on the Judgment Seat of Christ in
recent years, and interest in the subject is growing. However, can there
be complete revivals and restorations of accountability and the fear of
the Lord without revivals in sin-hating and obedience?:

Proverbs 8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
and THE EVIL WAY, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

The fear of the Lord is to hate the EVIL WAY. We must therefore,
obviously, seek the GOOD WAY. And the GOOD WAY is found in the OLD PATHS!:

Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
for the OLD PATHS, WHERE IS THE GOOD WAY, and walk therein, and ye shall
find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

Therefore, as we seek to understand and restore the fear of the Lord
(Proverbs 2:4-5), we must also seek to restore the old paths. Many of the
"fathers" (2 Kings 22:13) may not understand the need for such
restoration. The revolution might appear too radical. But we dare not
delay or turn aside from the task at hand! We must indeed show proper
respect to the elders (1 Timothy 5:1) who are perplexed at the extent of
the destruction of the flippant traditions they had embraced for so long.
Yet, we must understand that we must not turn aside an inch from obeying
our Lord. God is not playing games. God told Josiah that even the
extensive repentance and revival he promoted would do nothing but
temporarily DELAY His coming judgment:

2 Kings 23:25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned
to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his
might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there
any like him.
26 NOTWITHSTANDING the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great
wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the
provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.

We must learn from the above history:

1 Corinthians 10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples:
and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world
are come.
12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

We do not leave behind any truths which we might presently see more
clearly than the ancients (Matthew 13:52); yet, it is absolutely necessary
that we move with fear and get back to all that was RIGHT among them,
before "our fathers" went astray.

A 17-year-old Christian college student (Miss Georgia Hamann) has written
an article in "The New American" (June 2, 2003) that does an excellent job
in explaining the modern revolution. She titled her article, "The
Restorationist Rebellion." Her article has nothing to do with
Campbellites, the Charismatic movement, or rebellion in the strict sense
of the word. It has to do with RESTORING the "old paths" of Christian
morality in the face of opposition. She writes:

"The filth that spews daily from television barely provokes a shrug....My
generation tries hard to be edgy and rebellious, but they encounter
difficulty when Mom and Dad are being rebellious in the exact same way
using the exact same methods. Degenerate rock music is so integrated into
the culture that grocery stores play it....Today, can we say that anyone
who goes against the tide of evil is literally 'counterculture'? Is the
teen who rejects the warmed over musical offerings of his peer's culture -
in favor of, say, classical music - the new rebel? Modern Sodom is so
degenerate that virtue is the only shocking medium left....A girl who
wears a skirt and believes in modesty can empathize with the fake rebel's
cliched cries of 'no one understands me,' because sin-steeped society
cannot fathom virtue....We, a small but growing minority, spurn the
conventional trappings of our generation....Restorationists did not spring
from nowhere. Many of us graduated as homeschoolers; we are products of
parents who finally rebelled against their generation's lifestyle....We
are attracted to our grandparent's standards of morality, and we reject
the lifestyle of our parent's generation. Our parents, the baby boomers
[people born between 1946 and 1964], began as pawns of the establishment
they rebelled against. They were sacrificed to manipulators who used them
to overturn moral standards....Their wives were sent to work, their
children languished in day care, and they drove shiny cars....They
believed they were prosperous as they increased their credit card
debt....most baby boomers do not want to learn anything that will rock
their solid, slightly-left-of-center position....we restorationists grew
up with the devastating results of double income families....We saw the
results in our friends, ourselves, and even in our parents. Thus, we
believe very strongly in the necessity of a stay-at-home mom....Our
mothers bought into false feminism....We rebel only as we reject the
typical norms of our culture....There are already signs that our numbers
are growing..."

I will list just a few errors that have become ingrained in our Christian
culture for sometime. Yet, they must be rejected. However, to reject these
errors in this modern age will cause you to appear about as strange to
society as a girl with a pierced tongue and shorts would have appeared in
1850!:

1 Peter 4:4 Wherein they think it STRANGE that ye run not with them to the
same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the
dead.

It is not the purpose at this time to present many arguments against, or
to counter all the traditional gymnastics used by previous generations to
justify the following errors. The Scriptures are plain enough. Another
compelling reason to flee these errors lies in the fruit that previous
ages brought forth in rejecting them compared to the destruction reaped by
the generation that justified them. It is understood that many fathers
today will approve of these altars COMING DOWN about as much as some of
the fathers in Josiah's day approved of his house cleaning!:

1. DATING: "Dating" (i.e. "Will you be my pretend wife for a year without
a Biblical marriage covenant, so I can slobber on you as we watch ungodly
movies, and share intimate thoughts together, before you go pretend with
the next guy in church?") is one of the main, ungodly practices of
previous generations which has been the most dangerous to chastity and
purity. There is no place for any kind of "pretend covenant" between a
man and woman. Christians are brothers and sisters until they are engaged
to be married. There can indeed be a guarded "courting" period. But this
is a far cry from the "boyfriend/girlfriend" tradition.

2. SHORT HAIR ON WOMEN/LONG HAIR ON MEN: Though some in previous
generations taught against long hair on men on the basis of 1 Corinthians
11, there has been a strange silence (at least from 1960 onward)
concerning short hair on women.

3. UNISEX CLOTHING: Men should not be effeminate in dress (1 Corinthians
6:9), and women should not be masculine in dress (Deuteronomy 22:5). But
men are beginning to put on feminine dresses, and women have be wearing
men's pants for decades. Proper distinction between clothing is not
modest, but it serves as a barrier to sodomite propaganda.

4. IMMODEST CLOTHING: We (especially women) ought to cover our bodies (1
Timothy 2:9). The Bible begins and ends with mankind in nakedness. Jesus
tells the last generation, "Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his
garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame" (Revelation 16:15).
This is spiritual and LITERAL! How far we have come. From ancient times
until the 20th century, women did not even show their feet in public in
most civilized countries (in Rome, for instance, only the prostitutes
showed their feet. This was one of the only ways to distinguish them from
chaste women at the time). How far then have we gone today, with almost
NOTHING covered, and the church music bouncing bodies to a dance or
honky-tonk beat!

5. NEW VERSIONS: The King James Bible has proven that it is God's
preserved Word in English by its fruits. We do not need new versions. I
have heard hundreds of lectures and sermons by scholars with the various
copies and versions. If you want to spin your wheels and end up really
confused, then stay with these new versions. But God is calling us to hold
our ground. In the midst of all of the corrupt, religious excitement, we
have found the BOOK!

6. MOTHERS WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME: The Bible calls married women (who
are not barren) to bear children (1 Timothy 2:15), guide the house, and be
keepers at home (Titus 2). If mothers will stay home, then husbands must
work and be good providers (Proverbs 14:23, 1 Thess.4:11). They must avoid
debt (Proverbs 22:7) and idle schemes (Proverbs 28:22).

7. PUBLIC EDUCATION: It is the responsibility of parents to save their
children from immoral corruption. Public education today is religious
indoctrination into secular humanism and sodomite, feminist propaganda.

8. TELEVISION: This idle Christian's idol, when hooked up to worldly
programming, or when playing a worldly video, has no place in the modern
Josiah revolution - except destruction. It must come down from its high
place.

9. SINFUL MUSIC: Syncopated "dance" music with the sex or "honky-tonk"
beat also needs to fall by Josiah's sword. When Moody mildly syncopated a
few notes here and there, many were shocked, but pleased with the "lift."
When Billy Sunday went much further, many had had enough. They saw where
the ship was heading. And sure enough, the next few decades brought music
into the churches which could only be distinguished from bar or brothel
music by its lyrics (and then only sometimes). The black folk up north
rightly repudiated it as degenerating. Music can be lively, fast,
reviving, etc. without being syncopated in a dance or honky-tonk fashion.

Conclusion

I am sure that Josiah's bloody sword could bring down many more idols in
this revolution. But the main point is that we need to get back to the old
paths in general - and many fathers in high places are not going to
approve of it. But we must fear God rather than men. And we must be
convinced that He is already whetting His sword (Psalms 7:12), and is
ready to judge us for our flippancy. I do not maintain that there was a
perfect age when man was free from sin and trouble. Yet, there are clearly
landmarks or fences in earlier ages, which served to keep people within
proper moral boundaries. We have seen what happens when they are removed.
And we aim to put them back, by the power of God, regardless of how
strange or extreme people esteem us.

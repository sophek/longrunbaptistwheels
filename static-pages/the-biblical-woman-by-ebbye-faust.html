        <h1>"LET ME BE A WOMAN" - THE BIBLICAL WOMAN</h1>
        <div id="content">
            For years Christian women have been allowing the world to dictate to them what true "womanhood" is through the medium of TV, magazines and Hollywood. Through these ungodly means our minds have been ingrained with the world's teachings on how to act and dress, what we are to like and dislike, how to treat our husbands and children, and in general, how to live our day to day lives. So, what is the fruit of this independent age? Well, we have the highest divorce rate the world has ever seen, disobedient and rebellious children, immodesty, homosexuality, and immorality just to name a few examples. The churches have become filled, as 1 Peter 2:14 says, with people "that cannot cease from sin." Instead of Christians being a light in the world, we have let the world dim our light. Where women were once strong they are now weak and unable to "cope" with problems and difficulties without the worldly counsel of psychologists.

Are women entirely at fault for all of this? No, the Christian men have their share of blame. They have left off godly preaching against sin in order that they may not offend delicate ears. They have stopped preaching true doctrines from the Word so they might not appear to be "divisive" or "negative." But ladies, though we are not solely responsible for this condition, still we ARE at fault. The Bible commands the older women to teach the younger:
<blockquote>Titus 2:4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children.</blockquote>
The failure to obey this Scripture by previous generations of women has been one of the strongest weapons the enemy has used to remove us from our place (Rev. 2:5). Though we are all personally accountable for studying the Scriptures ourselves (2 Tim. 2:15) and finding out how the Lord would have us to be, the loss of strong, holy mothers teaching their fragile, younger daughters in Christ what true femininity is, has left us in this age a confused and rebellious people. The world has taught us that it is a shame to be a truly feminine woman; and it has also taught us that it is a shame to be mothers unless, of course, you are willing to give your children over to their "day cares" while you sacrifice your life (and your children's lives) to a "career"! Is God pleased with this age? I don't think that He is. I think that it is about time that holy women of God rise up and "rebel" against this modern world and return to the place that they are called.

Elizabeth Elliot, in "Let Me Be a Woman" has wisely written:
<blockquote>Â "Adam and Eve were not satisfied with the place assigned them by God. They refused the single limitation set upon them in the Garden of Eden and thus brought sin and death to the whole world. It was, in fact, the woman, Eve, who saw the opportunity to be something other than she was meant to be - the Serpent convinced her that she could easily be 'like God' - and she took the initiative. What sort of world might it have been if Eve refused the Serpent's offer and had said to him instead, 'Let me not be like God. Let me be what I was made to be - let me be a woman'?"</blockquote>

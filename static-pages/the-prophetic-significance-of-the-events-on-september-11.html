        <h1>THE PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EVENTS ON SEPTEMBER 11</h1>
        <div id="content">
            THE PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EVENTS ON SEPTEMBER 11 Michel de Nostradamus (d.1566) was a Catholic sorcerer. There is an e-mail circulating that is a fraud. It claims Nostradamus predicted the terrorist plane crashes into the towers in New York. It uses words never written by Nostradamus. Only God, through the Holy Bible, predicts the future without error (Isa.42:9). All other "prophets," "gods" and religious writings are fraudulent. They cannot predict the future (Isa.41:22-24); they therefore offer no objective verification that they are inspired of God. Does the Bible have anything to say about September 11th, 2001? It certainly does. Notice: 2 Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the LAST DAYS PERILOUS TIMES SHALL COME. 2 For men shall be... 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, FIERCE, despisers of those that are good... "Fierce" means "violent, savage, unrestrained." This is what we beheld on September 11. As long as suicide bombers are blowing up other countries many comfortable Americans remain asleep. But when it hits home, many panic. It seems too incredible. But this is not even the Tribulation Period yet! We are to watch and pray to be delivered from what is COMING (Lk.21:36). One of the first things that the world will experience in the Trib will be dreadful wars! Therefore whatever we see now is not the real "monster" at all. It is only the monster's shadow! If the shadow causes panic and fear, what will the monster bring?: Luke 21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth DISTRESS OF NATIONS, with PERPLEXITY; the sea and the waves roaring; 26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. "Perplexity" implies not only confusion, but also vexation! Welcome to the 21st century. The looming shadows of the coming perplexity are now upon us. It seems that every few years we hear the line, "This is the worst act of terrorism that has ever occurred on American soil." To date, September11th is certainly the most tragic day on record as far as terrorism is concerned. No events concerning the Tribulation Period have yet occurred. But that does not mean that current events lack any prophetic significance. Israel's restoration is significant simply because the Scriptures that speak of the end time Tribulation Period begin with Israel in her land as a distinct nation. Strange, perilous weather patterns, computer technology for the Mark of the Beast, the lining up of the nations, etc. are all significant because we are seeing the shadows or stage-setting of what will soon be according to the Bible. The prophecy that men will be fierce, or violent with no restraint in the last days is being fulfilled. Is America shocked at this new terrorism? Is it horrified? America has been TERRORIZING millions of little innocent infants for years. Mothers abort their babies. This is FIERCE. It is violent without any restraint of natural affection. Children now murder parents in cold blood. Fathers and mothers murder children. The world is growing fierce. The bonds of family, reason, and civility are all ignored. The events on September 11 are only part of the fulfillment of 2 Timothy 3. Mankind is growing fierce as predicted. The events on September 11 are significant in another way. I have been saying for quite awhile that the first nations to rule the world after the rapture will be Islamic. Iraq will come to power first. Then Iran. Then Greece and Syria; and only then will the West temporarily revive under the final Antichrist. Israeli intelligence has claimed that Iraq financed the bombings: "Iraq recruited Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden and his Islamic allies to carry out the suicide attacks around the United States, according to Israeli intelligence...The Baghdad regime has long maintained an alliance with Bin Laden and Islamic groups...In Baghdad, Iraqi state television appeared to welcome the bombings. The television said the spate of attacks demonstrated the vulnerability of the United States...The Israeli Cabinet was informed that the United States might launch a massive attack on Iraq and Afghanistan over the coming days. The sources said such an attack could prompt a regional war..." (WorldTribune, Sept.12) Regardless of who financed it, it is obvious now that Muslims were the ones who carried out the operation. We should not hate or persecute Muslims in this country; but we should realize there are over 7 million of them over here; how many of these have been properly investigated according to wise and just immigration laws? It is would be terribly naive to assume that none of these share the belief that Israel is the "Little Satan" and America is the "Big Satan". Ashcroft said it is a fact that the pilots who highjacked the jets were trained in U.S. flight schools. Unless Christians in America repent and this nation learns to FEAR GOD, America will be destroyed and blown apart internally by Muslim guerillas. If not, its constitution will be blown apart worse than it already is. In either case, America will cease to be a dominate world power and this will prepare the way for the rise of Iraq as seen in Daniel 2 and 7. I always thought it would be the rapture that allowed Iraq to rise in temporary dominance. It just might be terrorism: "Former Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who is also a terrorism expert, warned on Tuesday that the attacks in New York and Washington could be the harbinger of far worse scenarios, particularly when IRAN AND IRAQ obtain nuclear capabilities...'We must build a coalition against terror today, when our power is unmatched, because TOMORROW IT WILL BE MATCHED' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem."(CNSNews, Sept.12) Iraq was the only official GOVERNMENT that congratulated the murderers. Therefore, the horrible events of September 11 directly fulfill the prophecy in 2 Timothy 3 that warns that perilous times shall come in the last days because men shall be fierce. They also begin to set the stage for the rise of Islamic countries (Iraq and Iran) at the start of the coming Tribulation Period. Let us repent and pray for God's patience and mercy on our churches and on our country. In His longsuffering and longing for sinners to repent, He just might keep the light on in our country a few more years.

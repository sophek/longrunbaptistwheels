            "Children in this country have the good fortune to be occupied with less serious matters -- and millions of them tonight are preoccupied with a phenomenon. The subject matter may be familiar to you -- the world of Lord Voldemort, Quidditch and the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. For those who do not know what we are talking about, this is the Harry Potter phenomenon. 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' goes on sale with great fanfare at midnight Friday. This is the fourth in the series of books by J.K. Rowling that has lured children away from television and video games and a great many other things. Why are children clamoring to read a 700-page book? Why would any parents consider this a bad thing? And why has a children's story sparked a fight about the best-seller's list?" 
(ABCNEWS' World News Tonight, July 6, 2000, E-mail) 

"(AP) - Children eager to grab the first volumes of ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' crowded bookstores at midnight Friday, grabbing up volumes of the boy wizard's fourth magical adventure. Stores nationwide happily accommodated their wishes, with parties and sleepovers. Web-based companies like Amazon.com and Kozmo.com gave others the chance to get the books as fast, if not faster, from their homes...``The most important and magical outcome of this story is the love of reading that Harry Potter has rekindled among readers of all ages, especially young children,' said Barnes & Noble Vice Chairman Steve Riggio, whose company promised same-day delivery of books ordered by 11 a.m. Saturday. Like Waterstone's in Great Britain, some Barnes & Nobles in the United States invited youngsters to bring sleeping bags and await the witching hour. At the Glasgow Waterstone's, events manager Kim Hardie called the response phenomenal, saying 'about 80 percent of my time in the last fortnight (two weeks) has been spent dealing with Harry Potter queries.'" 

"...In Minnesota, Michigan, New York, California and South Carolina, parents who feel the books promote interest in the occult have called for their removal from classrooms and school libraries...Harry and his classmates attend the celebrated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. According to certain adults, these stories teach witchcraft, sorcery and Satanism. But hey, if it's not one 'ism,' it's another..." (The New York Times, October 22, 1999) 

"...The Harry Potter books have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and been translated into 31 languages. They totalled 98 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list and in Britain last year occupied three of the top five slots...And there is a film...Now, in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, death comes for us, too. The identity of the corpse is secret until next Saturday, though she will say that it is a character we care about. 'Yes, this is the book in which the deaths start. I always planned it this way..." (The Times, June 30, 2000) 

"What were the most memorable books you read as a child? - '...I also loved...of course, C.S. Lewis' Narnia books." (Salon) 

"'Witchcraft is the fastest-growing religion in America today." ('E',"Hollywood Spirituality," July 25, 1999) 

"'You're famous, Harry Potter.' It's true! This prophetic remark in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first in a seven-book series on popular witchcraft, was fulfilled in record time. The first three books hit the world's schools, libraries, and the New York Times best-sellers list like a spiritual tidal wave, breaking down barriers to the secret and forbidden mysteries of the ages and captivating children around the world. Just look around...Harry, like other students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry travels back and forth between two worlds: the mystical world of magic and the mundane world of muggles those boring, blinded, and biased humans who either don't believe in the world of witches or who despise it as evil. Harry's cruel aunt and uncle fit the last category. And, from Harry's point of view, so would you if you see witchcraft as dangerous and demonic...Harry lives a miserable muggle life in his uncle's London home, constantly tormented by his cruel guardians and a spoiled bully of a cousin. But on his eleventh birthday everything changes. He discovers that he is a wizard of great fame, someone who once conquered death and crippled a devilish foe. Even better, he receives an acceptance to Hogwarts â€“ a coveted boarding school for aspiring wizards...REMEMBER HISTORY'S LESSONS. The witchcraft and wizardry in Harry Potter books may be fantasy, but they familiarize children with a very real and increasingly popular religion, one that few really understand. Far removed from the terrors of tribal witchcraft and shamanism, Americans are oblivious to the bondages that normally follow occult favors. But historical and archeological records have traced the earth-centered myths, practices, and consequences through the millennia. They have verified the timing of certain Old Testament accounts of droughts, famines, and wars -- 
three consequences that God's people would face if they traded His truth and strength for the Canaanite gods and rituals. (Deut. 28, 1 Cor. 10)..." (Bewitched by Harry Potter, by Berit Kjos) 

Comments: 

Revelation 9:20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: 
21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their SORCERIES, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 

1Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 

Galatians 5:20 Idolatry, WITCHCRAFT, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 

The Bible is clear that in the last days witchcraft and sorcery will be widespread. In fact, it even reveals that many Christians will be caught up in it! These Harry Potter books are right on time in the end time scenario. We all know it. We all expect it. But it is so sad to watch. It is hard to watch so many young children embracing blatant witchcraft. There was a time when children's fiction stories contained dragons and witches; yet they were always evil. Then things began to change: 20th century fiction and fantasy began to divide witchcraft into the "good magic" and "bad magic." Even magnificently talented writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973) and C.S. Lewis (1898-1963) helped to plant the foundation for sorceries revival 
in our day. As wise as they were in so many things, they were often very naive in regard to evil and Satan's whole agenda. Tolkien did write about evil goblins; yet he would make the wizard to be a good guy. C.S. Lewis followed this practice by pretending that there is good and bad magic, and that God Himself used the "good" kind. He would make "magicians" (i.e. sorcerers) to be the good guys. For these reasons, these most wonderful books, filled with deep, Christian insights, deserve to be thrown into the trash can. What a waste. No parent should allow a child to read such books. What does God think about Christians making wizards and sorcerers out to be good guys for the minds of young children (Mark 9:42)?: 

Leviticus 20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 
7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. 

These Harry Potter books are dangerous because they are ten times more blatant about the so-called wonders and glories of witchcraft and magic; yet they contain none of the insights or Christian analogies of early children's books. We must beware. The Salem Witch Trials were caused by children playing with divination and witchcraft. The children would have "out-of-body-experiences" and be carried about by men on broom sticks with pointed hats. Many good people were murdered as a result. Sorcery brings evil wherever it goes. It is not just fantasy. We have children killing one another all across the land because they think Satan will give them power if they shed blood. J.K. Rowling needs to hang her head in shame for her irresponsibility. I hope she doesn't think the devil has allowed her to become a multi-millionaire just because she is a talented writer! She is bringing millions of young minds into the occult, and is helping to bring in the Antichrist. If you are a Christian and these words offend you, it is probably because your mind has been seduced by a devil.

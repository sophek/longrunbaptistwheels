        <h1>SEVEN REASONS FOR THE SHOOTINGS - KAU#105</h1>
        <div id="content">
            The AP reported on the 7th of March that an 8th-grade, Catholic girl shot another 8th-grader before being subdued by the school administrator. This came two days after two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a school shooting in Santee, Calif. I am sure all would agree that parents should do more to keep guns out of the reach of modern, rebellious teens. But of course, guns are not the problem, nor is "gun control" even part of the solution. This is easily proven. California has some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S. They did not stop the school shooting. Furthermore, "The Federalist" reports that recently a UC Santa Barbara student plowed his CAR into a group of classmates - killing four of them as he shouted, 'I'm the angel of death!'. Is it not obvious that the problem is not the weapons but the depraved minds that choose to commit murder? I will therefore list some things that could help bring an end to this mayhem:

1. The courts of the various states must firmly punish crime and truly become a "terror" to evil works (Rom.13:3,4).

2. The preachers of America need to obey the Bible and strongly EXHORT women to be keepers AT home (Tit.2:5,1Tim.5:14) where they can personally raise and teach their children. If needed, parents should use tutors. And I believe Christian or private schools should be used only if they do not demand too many hours from children outside their homes. They should be there to help, not REPLACE parental guidance and instruction. Yet, time is the crucial factor. The place the child spends the most time is truly the place the child is receiving his or her guidance and instruction. On the other hand, the public education system run by the government too often leads to moral depravity (if not illiteracy). Parents expect the teachers to "raise" their children, but the hands of teachers are tied. They have too many students and often (in many states) are not permitted to spank and punish as needed. Likewise, teachers complain that parents are not doing enough to raise their own children. But how can they? The don't even SEE their children for 8 hours a day, and when they do see them they are often too tired from working all day to be of any real value. It is not teachers or parents that are at fault as much as it is a STUPID system that must have been designed as a trap to eventually overthrow basic liberties by producing anarchy.

3. If we will continue this insane education system (that hinders the influence of the family), we must at least go back to the days when teachers could BEAT UP the disobedient, violent students. Teachers need to have access to guns so they can deter MURDERERS in the classrooms. Things like police work and public education are often dangerous jobs these days! I do not place the whole blame on the practice of sending children out of the home to government-run schools. But it is certainly a large part of this modern rebellion against common-sense and Bible-based morality. One objects by pointing out the fact that guns were very present in the late 19th century (when many children were sent away to public schools) and there were no school shootings like we have today. True, but there were many factors present in our society then that are not present today. For example, in the 19th century, MALE school teachers could BEAT UP rebellious, violent kids and send them home to be whipped again by their own parents! The following is a quote from the children's book, "Farmer Boy" by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It is a true story that happens to describe one schoolhouse with rebellious boys in the 1800's:
<blockquote>"[Almonzo] heard Father say to Mr. Corse: 'The Hardscrabble boys came to school today, Royal tells me.' 'Yes,' Mr. Corse [the teacher] said. 'I hear they're saying they'll throw you out....They have driven out two teachers...Last year they hurt Jonas Lane so bad HE DIED of it later.'....The room was still. Everybody was waiting. The big boys came up the path and clattered into the entry [of the school], hooting and jostling one another...Mr. Corse looked at them. Bill Ritchie [a rebellious student] laughed in his face, and still he did not speak. Mr. Corse lifted the lid of his desk and dropped one hand out of sight behind the raised lid. He said: 'Bill Ritchie, come up here.' Big Bill jumped up and tore off his coat, yelling: 'Come on, boys!' He rushed up the aisle...Mr. Corse stepped away from his desk. His hand came from behind the desk lid, and a long, thin black streak hissed through the air. It was a blacksnake ox-whip fifteen feet long. Mr. Corse held the short handle, loaded with iron, that could kill an ox. The thin, long lash coiled around Bill's legs, and Mr. Corse jerked. Bill lurched and almost fell. Quick as lightning the lash circled and struck and coiled again, and again Mr. Corse jerked. 'Come up here, Bill Ritchie, ' he said, jerking Bill toward him, and backing away. Bill could not reach him. Faster and faster the lash was hissing and crackling...Bill's trousers were cut through, his shirt was slashed, his arms bleeding from the bite of the lash...Bill rushed, and the floor shook when the whiplash jerked him over backwards. He got up swearing...The lash jerked him around. He began to bawl like a calf. He blubbered and begged...Mr. Corse threw him headlong into the entry and slammed and locked the door...The other big boys had got the window open. One, two, three, they jumped out into the deep snow and floundered away...Then Mr. Corse called the arithmetic class...The big boys were licked! Mr. Corse had licked Bill Ritchie's gang from Hardscrabble Settlement!" (pp.29, 43-47)</blockquote>
4. We have school shootings because parents no longer consistently spank their children at an early age. One irrational, anti-spanking web site [http://www.religioustolerance.org/spanking.htm] quotes the following
statistics:
<blockquote>"A survey of US parents shows a drop in the use of spanking as the main disciplinary method from 59% in 1962 to 19% in 1993. Parents now prefer using time-outs (38%) and lecturing (24%). Surveys showed that over 90% of parents spanked their children in the 1930's...."</blockquote>
I guess these people are happy with these statistics and conclude that children are doing so much better these days! They need to wake up and see that the problem with this age is there is no true accountability. And spanking teaches children accountability.

The Bible does not endorse child abuse. It condemns provoking children to wrath by "out of control" screaming, insults, and deep, emotional, manipulating guilt-trips (the "lectures" that have largely replaced spanking!) etc. (Col.3:21). Nevertheless, modern society (mostly out of fear) has embraced the Hollywood, liberal, psychological lie that spanking will worsen behavior! Therefore, children are not TRAINED from an early age to FEAR or even CARE about consequences. Children should never have to gamble and wonder how many times a parent will threaten before actually punishing disobedience. Discipline should be stern, consistent and speedy enough to serve as a true deterrent:
<blockquote>Pr 13:24 Â¶ He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.</blockquote>
5. Parents do not keep their children away from dangerous movies and music. They therefore allow precious minds to become perverted and desensitized. The big debate today is in regard to whether or not SATANIC movies and music will influence a child's behavior in a negative way. This whole debate is IDIOTIC. Of course music and movies influence behavior (Pr.9:6, 13:20, 1Cor.15:33, 2Tim.2:21)! The argument is often made that the majority of children will be able to perceive what they see on the screen as nothing more than "make believe". Let's assume this is true. If it is, then that's the PROBLEM! We have children listening to violent music and watching violent movies and then they turn it off and "enter reality". They laugh at the suffering they see on the screen. Such things as blood, guns and human suffering are all parts of one big fantasy! After enough of this, some begin to live out the movies and personally become the depraved "stars" who kill people on the screen. After all, its all "make believe" isn't it? Isn't life one BIG MOVIE? Children should be taught the opposite. Violence isn't "funny". Suffering isn't "entertainment". If you kill your classmates it will not be "cool". It will be a selfish act that will be punished to the fullest extent of the law. After you go on your murderous rampage you cannot hit the "stop" button on the VCR, grab a Coke and put it all behind you! These kids are angry. They have not been trained to control themselves and deny their passions. It is time to go back to guarding what children watch, read and hear. A strict, holy environment will not worsen a child's behavior if it is non-abusive, non-hypocritical and loving. It is the only thing that will save this generation.

6. Another reason children are out of control is that psychobabble is trying to replace Christianity and the local church. But it is powerless and blind. It tells parents not to spank their children. It tells children that they should have high self-esteem. But you cannot esteem something unless you COMPARE it with something else. Therefore, high self-esteem means nothing unless it means a person is MORE VALUABLE than someone else. Since you cannot value anything without measuring it with something else, the Bible teaches Christians to esteem everyone else as better than themselves (Phil.2:3)! So as children are taught high self-esteem (instead of sharing, humility, and putting others first) they simply obey what they are taught and begin esteeming themselves more important than others! If they are mad at someone, they conclude that it is BETTER to destroy another person's whole life than it is to endure the temporary pain of controlling their own anger and aggression. After all, they have high self-esteem and they therefore consider themselves more valuable than others. Furthermore, psychobabble teaches parents to dope up their kids on brain drugs. This is leading to more confusion in emotional teens that don't need anymore confusion!

7. Too many Christians are not soul-winning and preaching the true Gospel of God. The worse things become, the more many Christians think they must "tighten" the Gospel. Many modern, Christian tracts include a long list of things that a person must do to be saved! We need to get back to door-knocking and evangelism that tells lost sinners that Jesus shed His Blood to save them. Churches need to start training people to fulfill the Great Commission. They need to have regular soul-winning times where members can go out and learn how to reach lost people. Many churches do nothing but fellowship and enjoy "Christian" entertainment with one another. True fellowship is important, but we need to get back to placing the real emphasis on evangelism and discipleship where lost people can get saved and then learn to fear, love and obey their Lord.

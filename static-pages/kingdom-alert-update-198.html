            THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF LIBERTINISM

The Bible clearly teaches that Christendom, in the latter days, will be
invaded by a mystical, Gnostic libertinism:

2 Peter 2:19 While they promise them LIBERTY, they themselves are the
servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.

2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound
doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
teachers, having itching ears;
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto fables.

2 Peter 3:16 As also in all his [Paul's] epistles, speaking in them of
these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they
that are unlearned and unstable WREST, as they do also the other
scriptures, unto their own destruction.
17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest
ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, FALL from your own
stedfastness.

Jude 1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, TURNING the grace of our
God INTO LASCIVIOUSNESS, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus
Christ.

It has now arrived, and it is gaining ground. The blight is thoroughly
ecumenical. It is found in every denomination. In varying degrees, it has
also made inroads into fundamentalism and conservative evangelicalism. It
is time for every Christian leader to boldly take a stand against this
creeping fungus.

Libertinism In History

In defining "Gnosticism," John Henry Blunt's "Dictionary of Sects" (1903),
states:

"Several sects of the [early Gnostics] were clearly antinomian....their
theory of the Demiurge was soon extended from the sphere of physical
creation to that of MORAL LAW, and then the moral law shared with the
material world in condemnation as his evil work. Thus a theoretical
Antinomianism sprung up which soon developed into practical license..."(1)

Irenaeus (c. 130-202), in the 2nd century, rebuked the doctrines and
practices of these early, libertine heretics:

"....they think the spiritual is incapable of receiving corruption,
whatever moral conduct they may practice....they say of themselves,
whatever may be the character of their material morality, that they cannot
be injured by it, nor lose their spiritual substance. Hence the most
perfect among them perform all forbidden things without any scruple."(2)

He continues:

"Wherefore also it comes to pass, that the 'most perfect' among them
addict themselves WITHOUT FEAR to all those kinds of forbidden deeds of
which the Scriptures assure us that 'they who do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God.'....at every heathen festival celebrated in
honour of the idols, these men are the first to assemble; and to such a
pitch do they go, that some of them DO NOT EVEN keep away from that bloody
spectacle hateful both to God and men, in which gladiators either fight
with wild beasts, or singly encounter one another....And committing many
other abominations and impieties, they run US down (WHO FROM THE FEAR OF
GOD guard against sinning even in thought or word) as utterly contemptible
and ignorant persons, while they highly exalt themselves...."(3)

Obviously, Irenaeus, if he were living today, would find that the
libertine Gnosticism he wrote against is now engulfing much of modern
Christendom in its hellish flames! The "bloody spectacle hateful both to
God and men" is blaring, with gory close-ups, in the very living rooms of
almost every Christian. And to speak of the "fear of God" today is to
invite scorn and rage, if not a literal stoning.

At the time of the Reformation (and afterwards), multiple sects would
arise advocating evil, antinomian principles. These immoral sects should
not be confused with the obedient Christians in history who proclaimed the
true Gospel of God. Many of these saints were, like the apostle Paul
(Romans 3:8), slandered by Romanists and Legalists as "antinomian" because
they made a proper distinction between positional justification and
practical sanctification, and taught eternal salvation by grace through
faith alone.(4) Yet, some of the various sects that were called
"antinomian," deserved the name.

The "Libertines" were one of the first immoral groups to arise during the
Reformation. According to the "Concise Encyclopedia of Religious
Knowledge" (1895), the Libertines were pantheistic:

"A party of loose pantheistic-rationalists which arose in the Netherlands
during the Reformation. They affirmed that nothing was bad by itself and
that God is all, and all is God, so that the natural passions are but the
voices of the Spirit."(5)

Blunt's "Dictionary of Sects" writes concerning the Libertines:

"Their principles were, that God being the Author of all human actions, no
human action could be evil; that religion consists in union with God by
contemplation, and that any one who had attained to this was free to act
according to their pleasure."(6)

The Ten Libertine Commandments

It is obvious that "libertinism" (past and present) is the justification
of SIN by perverting Scripture or reason. The following are some of its
commandments that the devils have given to Christendom through false
teachers over the years:

I. "Since the body is material, and not spiritual, always believe and
preach that God does not care what we do in the body."

Refuted:

Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
ye present your BODIES a living sacrifice, HOLY, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service.

II. "Since the Pharisees served God outwardly, but were sinners inwardly,
always believe and preach that God does not care about the outward."

Refuted: We are called to have a higher moral righteousness than the
Pharisees, by having an outward AND an inward morality through Jesus
Christ (Matthew 23:23):

Matthew 5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
EXCEED the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus does not teach that the outward is not important!:

"....is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid." (Galatians
2:17)

Indeed, some works should remain private (devotions, fasting, alms). Yet,
"private" does not mean INWARD. And many other works are to be performed
outwardly in the sight of men:

Matthew 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

III. "The spirit of every Christian is perfect. Therefore, the thoughts
and impressions of every Christian are one with God and His Spirit. Always
believe and preach that Christians do not have to worry about sinning in
spirit."

Refuted: This lie not only "sanctifies" inward sins such as pride, envy,
hatred, etc. It also causes Christians to presumptuously think (before
testing) that their decisions and desires are given by God, when they may
be from the Devil. The whole man (body, soul and spirit) of a Christian is
eternally saved (imputed righteousness). Yet, none are totally sanctified
in this life. The goal of the Christian life is to sanctify the whole man
(outward and inward) practically. The libertines leave out one or the
other, either by teaching that it is already 100% sanctified, or by
teaching that it doesn't matter in the eyes of God. But God wills that all
of the Christian (body, soul, spirit) is not yet perfect, but should be
growing toward perfection:

1 Corinthians 5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of
the flesh, that the SPIRIT may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

Colossians 3:2 Set your AFFECTION on things above, not on things on the
earth.

1 Thessalonians 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you WHOLLY; and I
pray God your whole SPIRIT and SOUL and BODY be preserved BLAMELESS unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1 Corinthians 6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God
in your body, and in your SPIRIT, which are God's.

1 Thessalonians 3:13 To the end he may stablish your HEARTS UNBLAMEABLE IN
HOLINESS before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ with all his saints.

Ephesians 4:23 And be renewed in the SPIRIT of your mind;

IV. "I AM sinning outwardly, but this is simply my 'flesh.' Paul says that
the flesh is evil and it cannot do any good. Always believe and preach
this."

Refuted: This lie confuses the TEMPTATION to evil within a man (which will
remain until glory), with the Christian himself! When the Christian sins,
it is the Christian himself that has WALKED AFTER or SOWN to the flesh
(the inward temptations):

2 Peter 2:10 But chiefly them that WALK AFTER THE FLESH in the lust of
uncleanness....

Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
Christ Jesus, who WALK NOT after the FLESH, but after the Spirit.

Galatians 6:8 For he that SOWETH to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption...

It is not the "flesh" that soweth to the flesh! It is not the "flesh" that
walks after the flesh! It is the Christian himself. Therefore, blaming sin
on the flesh will get the Christian nowhere at the Judgment Seat of
Christ. Every Christian is indeed positionally justified. But we are not
discussing imputed righteousness. We are discussing the Christian WALK.
And to excuse or blame sin in the Christian life on the "flesh" is
irresponsible and antinomian.

V. "When God sees me, He only sees Jesus. Always believe and preach that
there will be no real chastisement for sin at the Judgment Seat because of
this truth."

Refuted:

Malachi 2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that DOETH EVIL is good in the
sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of
judgment?

This statement is true in regard to eternal salvation. But God did not
justify the sinner just to leave him in sin. The new Christian is now
commanded to use the Word of God, and the indwelling Spirit, and his new
privileges and motivations to GROW. In regard to the Christian walk, the
Christian is only HOLY if he is WALKING in holiness. If he sows to the
flesh, he will reap corruption and temporary destruction (1 Corinthians
3:16, 2 Corinthians 5:9-11, Galatians 6:8).

VI. "Obeying commandments is fleshly. We should simply love God. Always
believe and preach this."

Refuted: This lie divorces the love of God from obedience to God, and
turns the Christian life into a mystical, contemplative antinomianism. The
Pharisees sinned by professing to love God through outward works in the
sight of men. Their motives were wrong. Inwardly, they were full of
hatred, pride, greed and envy (Matthew 23:28). Therefore, the Pharisees
were not "fleshly" because they were obeying God's commandments! They were
fleshly for only obeying SOME of them! The true love of God must strive to
obey ALL of God's commandments (and confess when we fail):

1 John 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
his commandments are not grievous.

John 15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as
I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

John 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.

1 Corinthians 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
but the keeping of the commandments of God.

These verses shatter the lies of the new libertine Gnosticism that has
infected the churches.

VII. "Since no one is perfect, I have to WALK in sin. Always believe and
preach this."

Refuted:

Luke 1:6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

2 Corinthians 1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the
world, and more abundantly to you-ward.

John 21:17 ...Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love
thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

There is obviously a degree of relative perfection (based on each man's
light, maturity, degree of temptations, etc.) that we can walk in. Paul,
in Romans 7, is discussing the inward principle of fleshly temptation that
he found to be inescapable. Nowhere in the chapter does he maintain that
the Christian must WALK after this inward law of sin. To do so is to be in
danger of judgment. When we walk after sin, we should fear God and confess
it, and forsake sin in repentance. But it is a worse sin to excuse it by
saying that we HAVE to walk after it:

Jeremiah 18:12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will WALK after our
own devices, and we will every one DO the imagination of his evil heart.

VIII. "Since God is Sovereign, all of my sin is caused by God willing me
to sin. Always believe and preach this."

Refuted: God can cause the wrath of man to praise him, and use man's sin
to work out His own purposes, as in the case of Joseph's brethren, or
Nebuchadnezzar's chastisement upon Israel. Yet, the Babylonian kings were
later punished for their SIN (Jeremiah 25:12). Sin is disobedience to God.
It is DOUBLE sin to then blame God for disobedience:

Galatians 2:17 ....is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.

1 John 3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil...

Ezekiel 33:11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no
pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way
and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O
house of Israel?

IX. "This IS sin. But it is not ME. My new nature does not sin. Always
believe and preach this."

Refuted: This confuses the "new man" of provision that God graciously
provides through Christ for every Christian, with the Christian HIMSELF
(see Bonar's "God's Way of Holiness"). But the Christian himself must PUT
ON this new man, daily:

Ephesians 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created
in righteousness and true holiness.

When the Christian sins, it was the Christian himself who sinned! He
sinned by not putting on the new man (God's grace in sanctification
through Christ):

Hebrews 12:28 ...let us HAVE GRACE, whereby we may serve God acceptably
with reverence and godly fear:

It will not be the "new nature" that will get the stripes at the Judgment
Seat of Christ. It will be the Christian (a saved, justified, blood-bought
saint who had a new man of power to walk in, but did not avail himself of
it) who will be ashamed and chastised (2 Corinthians 5:9-11).

X. "My fellowship with Jesus is not hurt by my sin. Always believe and
preach this."

Refuted: This lie confuses relationship with fellowship. It confuses the
eternal relationship (which cannot be lost by sin) with the daily
fellowship (which can be lost). John writes against this lie. He teaches
that fellowship is maintained by obedience:

1 John 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
all sin.

Conclusion

These ten commandments of libertinism are only a summary. Some Christian
libertines have invented many others. Most modern libertines can quote
these commandments, and switch from one to the other, and back again,
faster than lightning when convicted. May the Lord stir up the hearts of a
multitude of preachers to confound these lies, that believers may be fully
set free from the dominion and bondage of sin (Romans 6:14, 2 Peter 2:19).

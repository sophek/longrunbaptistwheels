THE THREE CONDITIONS OF REVIVAL PRAYER (Sermon, by Joey Faust)
*******************************************************************
[We have seen some wonderful results in answer to prayer at Kingdom
Baptist Church in recent weeks, and we look for more fruit by the Lord's
mercy and grace! I hope this sermon will also encourage Kingdom Alert
readers not to forsake the privilege of prayer.]

TEXT: Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint;
5 Yet because this widow TROUBLETH ME, I will avenge her, lest by her
CONTINUAL COMING she weary me.

This sermon will be a summary of the material we have covered the past few
months concerning prayer. Once we understand as Christians to pray in the
name of Jesus, and to pray in faith, and to pray according to God's
revealed will, three main, crucial qualities of prayer are summed up in
James 5. These qualifications are the "exercise" of faith in our prayer
lives:

James 5:16 CONFESS your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed. The EFFECTUAL FERVENT prayer of a RIGHTEOUS man
availeth much.

There are THREE points here:

1. Confess and forsake sin; be "righteous."
2. Pray "Effectually."
3. Pray "Fervently."

We will deal with them in this order. Let take a brief look at the first
qualification:

I. Confess and Forsake Sin; Be Righteous.

In the previous sermon, "The Prayer Power of a Separated Life," we have
seen that one of the most important conditions for successful prayer is
the obedience of the person praying! Husbands be not bitter against your
wives! Wives reverence your husbands ands obey them in all things - that
your prayers be not hindered (1 peter 3:7)! We are to pray for
conversions, according to 1 Timothy 2:1-4. But the Lord goes on to specify
that we  lift up HOLY hands to Him in prayer. We receive from Him because
we do things PLEASING in His sight. Too many Christians ask what they may
"get away with" instead of what "pleases" the Lord. If we have wronged our
fellow brother or sister; if we have defrauded any; we need to also
confess our faults to those we have wronged. We need clean hands to lift
to the Father. This is the first qualification for revival prayer. Let us
notice the second qualification:

II. Pray Effectually.

This is the subject of Luke 18. Let us take a moment to study this word
"effectual." Keep James 5 before your eyes and mind as we proceed. A
common definition of "effectual" is that which is "effective"; or that
which "achieves the result." But that would mean that James would be
writing, "The prayer that achieves results, will avail much," which would
be to say the same thing twice - and thus appear to say nothing.

But there is more to this word. "Effectual," according to Oxford English
Dictionary, also means:

Effectual: "Earnest; urgent." (Oxford Dictionary)

And this is exactly how it is defined in the CONTEXT by the example of
Elijah:

James 5:16...The EFFECTUAL fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
much.
17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he PRAYED
EARNESTLY that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the
space of three years and six months.

Since we have seen that "effectual" means "earnest," let us also take a
close look at this English word according to English dictionaries:

Earnest: "Ardour [i.e. burning] in battle; intense passion or
desire...serious intentions, as opposed to jest or play..."

Our prayers should b serious. In prayer we are battling with the flesh and
the Devil, and we are seeking, though Jesus to supplicate the Father. This
is a serious, sober business.

The second word Oxford uses to define "effectual" is "URGENT." When we
notice what "urgent" means, we will have found the meaning of the
"effectual" prayer that James says will avail much! Notice:

Urgent: "Pressing; IMPORTUNATE." (Oxford Dictionary)

Importunate: "Constancy of action....Persistent or pressing in
solicitation...TROUBLING..."  (Oxford)

Let us sum all of this up. After we confess and repent and obey, we can
then begin to pray EFFECTUALLY. To pray effectually means to pray
earnestly, which means to pray urgently, which means to pray
IMPORTUNATELY! James tells us that IMPORTUNITY is one of the chief
conditions of prayer that will avail with God!

It is the sense of need and intensity of desire that causes people to be
persistent in asking or pleading. Notice some verses that show this
intensity, so we might imitate it with God in prayer:

Jeremiah 11:7 For I EARNESTLY protested unto your fathers in the day that
I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising
early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.

Luke 22:44 And being IN AN AGONY HE PRAYED MORE EARNESTLY: and his sweat
was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

Exodus 12:33 And the Egyptians WERE URGENT upon the people, that they
might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead
men.

Judges 16:16...she PRESSED HIM DAILY with her words, and URGED HIM, so
that his soul was vexed unto death;

Luke 11:7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and
give thee.
8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his
friend, yet BECAUSE OF HIS IMPORTUNITY he will rise and give him as many
as he needeth.
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; KNOCK, AND IT SHALL BE OPENED unto you.

The meaning of "effectual prayer" is illustrated in the above Scriptures!
It is the prayer of importunity that does not faint. It is the prayer that
knocks, and troubles, until it receives!:

Isaiah 62:6  I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which SHALL
NEVER HOLD THEIR PEACE DAY NOR NIGHT: ye that make mention of the LORD,
KEEP NOT SILENCE,
7 And GIVE HIM NO REST, TILL he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a
praise in the earth.

We can see this effectual, urgent, earnest, prevailing importunity in
Jacob:

Genesis 32:25 And when he [the angel of the Lord] saw that he prevailed
not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of
Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I WILL NOT
LET THEE GO, EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME.
27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for AS
A PRINCE HAST THOU POWER WITH GOD AND WITH MEN, AND HAST PREVAILED.

1. The widow in Luke 18 had an adversary. She would not stop coming.

2. The Canaanite woman in Matthew 15:22 had an adversary who was vexing
her
daughter. She would not be discouraged by silence or by an apparent
rejection.

3. Blind Bartimaeus would not keep silent, though he was rebuked. When
they attempted
to silence him in prayer, he cried out even louder (Mark 10:48).

4. Jacob would not let go, though he had already wrestled all night, and
the angel of the
Lord had thrown his leg out of joint in an attempt to test his resolve,
and make him let
loose!

This is the type of prayer that prevails! It will not be discouraged. It
will not faint! It is the EFFECTUAL prayer that will avail much! And
"effectual" means IMPORTUNATE:

"The great point is to never give up until the answer comes."
(George Mueller)

We have seen that we must be righteous. We have seen that we must be
persistent or effectual. But let us now look at one last condition:

III. Pray Fervently.

Fervency is defined as:

Fervency: Warmth of emotion...

Hosea shows us that Jacob, who as a prince prevailed with God, had more
than just importunity. He had fervency of emotion in his supplication:

Hosea 12:4 Yea, he [Jacob] had power over the angel, and prevailed: HE
WEPT, and made supplication unto him...

This is what we need. We need to cry for our sins, and cry for the lost or
backslidden condition of others. When this is mixed with the two previous
conditions, it will bring forth fruit:

Psalms 126:5 They that SOW IN TEARS shall reap in joy.
6 He that goeth forth AND WEEPETH, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless
come again with rejoicing, BRINGING HIS SHEAVES WITH HIM.

We are in the days of lukewarm Christianity, where the love of many waxes
cold and selfish. Can you have a show of emotion (like a Pharisee) and be
a hypocrite? Of course. Can you weep over sinners and fail to weep and
repent over your own sins? Of course. But do these abuses justify running
to the other extreme of a DEAD, FAT FATALISM drenched in stiff, cold
APATHY? Absolutely not! It is time that we learn to travail for souls! Our
churches are settled on their lees instead of on their knees (Zephaniah
1:12)!:

Isaiah 66:8 ...as soon as Zion TRAVAILED, she BROUGHT FORTH her children.

Galatians 4:19 My little children, of whom I TRAVAIL IN BIRTH AGAIN until
Christ be formed in you,

Paul knew that winning lost souls and establishing wandering saints
required pain and weeping (Acts 20:31).

Such holy affections are not artificially manufactured directly. They are
wrought through the Holy Spirit, by setting our thoughts and wills in the
proper place.

Let us notice just a few revival preachers and see that they all
understood, in one way or another, the need for fervency of emotion:

20th century:

"I have never seen a real revival without much weeping....there is plenty
about which to weep. There is the coldness of our own hearts....there is
the bitter, backslidden disobedience of so many of our own church members.
An evangelist once said rightly that he found as many cigarette butts in
front of a church as he ever did in passing in front of a bar. There is
the emptiness of our churches, particularly on Sunday nights, and the
heartbreaking few who come to prayer meeting....Here is plenty cause for
weeping. A revival is a time of weeping over the unsaved. They will not
weep, nor even pray for themselves....Oh, that God would give us the gift
of tears..."
(Hyman Appelman, "Formula for Revival," 1954)

In other words, if we can't cry for sinners and for our sins, this alone
would be a good reason to cry!:

"Can we travail for a drowning child, but not for a perishing
soul?...Nothing short of continuous, agonizing, pleading for souls, hours
upon hours, days and nights of prayer, will avail." (Oswald J. Smith, "The
Passion for Souls")

19th century:
"It has always been so in great revivals...[i.e. great weeping in
prayer]."
(Charles Finney, "Lectures on Revival")

18th century:

"[Is all this weeping simply emotional fanaticism? No.] The spirit of
these that have been in distress for the souls of others...seems not to be
different from that of the apostle [Paul], who travailed for souls...Nor
from that of the Psalmist...'Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because
they keep not thy law...'"
(Jonathan Edwards, "Thoughts on Revivals")

They all understood the principle revealed in Joel 2:12:

Joel 2:12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all
your heart, and WITH FASTING, AND WITH WEEPING, and with mourning:
17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, WEEP between the porch and
the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine
heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore
should they say among the people, Where is their God?

Great answers to effectual, fervent revival prayer were seen in the Welsh
revival. Notice some reports of this revival:

Welsh Revival [1904-1905]: In one town the tavern sold only 9 cents worth
of liquor on Saturday night!...."The Times" observed that "The whole
population had been suddenly stirred by a common impulse. Religion had
become the absorbing interest of their lives. They had gathered at crowded
services for six and eight hours at a time....'

'Former blasphemers were the most eloquent, both in prayer and
praise...Drunkards forgot the way to saloons...they were busy
worshiping....With ever increasing momentum, the movement advanced,
creating unprecedented excitement among the churches and the secular
institutions outside."
(Matthews, "I Saw the Welsh Revival")

The following report of F. B. Meyer concerning the Welsh Revival reveals
that the power of God, working through EFFECTUAL, FERVENT PRAYER was
behind it all:

"During the Welsh Revival [1904-1905], Dr. F. B. Meyer saw one evening a
young minister come to a crowded meeting. This young man stood up and
prayed in behalf of two of his companions who were scoffing. One of these
men arose and said...'I simply said I was not an infidel, but an agnostic,
and if God wants to save me, I will give Him a fair opportunity. Let Him
do it!' That boast seemed to strike Evan Roberts [the young minister] so
that he fell on his knees in a perfect agony of soul. It seemed as though
his very heart would break beneath the weight of this man's sin. A friend
of Dr. Meyer's who stood near him said, 'This is too dreadful! I cannot
bear to hear this man groan so! I will start a tune to drown it!' Dr.
Meyer said, 'Whatever you do, don't do that. I want this thing to sink
into my heart...I want the throb of this man's anguish to touch my own
soul.' Evan Roberts sobbed on and on, and Meyer said, 'My God, let me
learn that sob, that my soul would break while I preach the gospel to
men!' After about then minutes Evan Roberts arose and addressed the men in
the gallery: 'Will you yield?' They said, 'Why should we?' Then he said to
the people: 'Let us pray.' The air became heavy with sighs, tears, and
groans. Everybody seemed to be carrying these two men upon their hearts,
as if their hearts must break beneath the strain. Dr. Meyer declares that
he never felt anything like it. He sprang to his feet. Felt as though he
was choking. He said to his friend: 'We are in a very fight between Heaven
and Hell...' After that, one of the men yielded while the other, like the
impenitent thief, went his way....If it took that to reach men in the
Great Welsh Revival, will it not take the same today?"
(H. C. Van Wormer, "Soul Travail")

If every person with a heart and a brain will weep and compel with all
their might a teen not to shoot himself, why is it considered a strange
thing to weep and compel sinners with all our might not to go to Hell?
Jesus wept over Jerusalem. It is because we are looking at the things
which are seen. When Jesus comes shall He find faith on earth?

================================================================
An E-mail from Jim Fellure [VictoryBaptistPress@msn.com]:

"Dear Pastor/Friend: No doubt, many of you are already familiar with the
information in this letter, but for those who are not aware of what is
happening with the Thompson brothers of Austin, Texas, please allow me the
time to tell you of a great tragedy and need that we as Christians should
and can help with. Pastor Hank and Mona Thompson's twenty-four year old
twin boys, Joshua and Caleb disciplined an eleven year old boy that
attended their Spanish church with a switch, but it was nothing like the
liberal press made it sound. The press reported that the boy was beaten
for an hour and a half with a tree limb. Any person with good reasoning
knows that if two twenty-four year old young men had beaten an eleven year
old boy that long with a tree limb they would have killed him. The boy
doesnâ€™t have any permanent health problems from the discipline. There were
no broken bones, In fact, when the forensic investigation was done, not
one trace of blood was found, either in the Thompsons car the boy rode in,
or in the room where the discipline took place. Evidently the skin was not
even broken. The boy did have some bruises and he did spend some time in
the hospital, but one doctor said the boy had been hit with something more
than a switch, something with a flat surface, and the boy testified that
his Mother and Father sometimes whipped him with a stick or belt. For some
reason that information never showed up in court. Also, on the web site
for the famous Mayo Clinic it says this about a bruise 'Generally, the
harder the blow, the larger the bruise. However, if you bruise easily, a
minor bump - one you may not even notice - can result in substantial
discoloration.' I wonder if the boy that was disciplined just might bruise
easily? Another thing that puzzles me is, that if the boy was beaten as
badly as the liberal news media, and the liberal courts made it sound, how
come the boy, after being released from the hospital never made one trip
back to the doctor for a follow-up on treatment to his 'injuries'? I have
been in Pastor Hank Thompson's home and also preached for him many times.
I have also preached for Joshua Thompson in the Spanish church and I have
found them to be some of the most gracious, unselfish people that I have
ever met. I do not believe that the Thompsons would intentionally do harm
to anyone. Joshua and Caleb did not discipline the boy with malice or
hostility in their heart. They thought they were helping the boy; however,
they did make a tragic mistake, and have confessed and taken full
responsibility for their actions. Nevertheless, Joshua and Caleb were
charged with injury to a child and found guilty in a liberal Austin court
on December 10, 2003. Joshua was immediately sentenced to twenty-six years
and Caleb to fourteen years in the Texas state penitentiary. The problem
we now have is with the severity of the sentences. According to a recent
report by James Dobson and Tim LaHaye 'the average rapist is out in 5.2
years and murderers are out in 8.6 years.' Joshua and Caleb Thompson have
absolutely no previous criminal record, they are men of God, each with a
wife, a family, and a ministry that needs them, and I, along with
thousands of others, are totally confident that if they were out of prison
they would never make the same mistake again, yet these young, Christian
men are sentenced to twenty-six and fourteen years respectively. It's
unreasonable and something must be done about it. We are asking our
friends to get on board and help get the Thompson brothers out of prison.
Would you write the governor and the president a personal letter
expressing your opinion about this situation? Would you get others to
write, call, send emails, use your bulk email lists, put this information
on your web pages, contact the governors web page? If you live in Texas
call the Citizen's Opinion Hotline at (800) 252-9600. You may also send a
message to the governor through his web site at
http://governor.state.tx.us/ Finally, we need as many people and churches
as possible to help get signatures on the enclosed petitions. If you will
help with this project,
1. Make as many copies of the enclosed petitions as you need
2. Sign both petitions yourself, then get neighbors, work associates,
relatives, anyone who is a registered voter that agrees with the petitions
to sign them.
3. Call other churches and get them involved
4. Set a goal. This letter is going to over 6,000 Baptist Churches and
several hundred individuals. If each church would get only 1,000
signatures (some can do much more) that would give us six million
signatures asking the governor and the president to release these boys
from prison. If you cannot get 1,000, get what you can. Every signature
will count.
5. As your petitions are completed, if at all possible, make a copy of
each one and send the copies to Pastor Thompson then mail the master copy
to the governor and to the president. If you cannot make copies, call or
write Brother Thompson and let him know how many signatures were on your
petitions.
6. Finally, spend some time FASTING and PRAYING on behalf of the Thompson
family.
The Governor's address is: The Honorable Governor Rick Perry, P.O. Box

The Presidents address is: President George W. Bush, The White House, 1600

Note: All letters, including the petitions to the governor and the
president should be sent by certified mail to assure that they personally
get them.

Please, brethren, let's show our love and concern for these brothers in
the Lord and put some effort and sacrifice into this worthy cause, then
pray a lot for the Lord to bless our efforts. In Christ, Jim Fellure

        <h1>JERUSALEM THE STUMBLING BLOCK AND THE ERROR OF IRVIN BAXTER JR. IN REGARD TO THE TRIBULATION - KAU#075</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Israel is in the news like never before. The fight is on over the status of Jerusalem. The latest news is that the Israeli leader has offered to "split" Jerusalem. This temporary compromise might be the very thing that leads to the prophesied temple being rebuilt with the outer court in the hands of the Gentiles (Rev.11:2). The Palestinians, however, want total control of the Temple mount in the walled Old City. It contains the compound of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Things are moving so quickly that there is no time to catch one' s breath and properly evaluate it all.

The Bible said that Jerusalem would be a the cause of much controversy in the Tribulation period:
<blockquote>Zechariah 12:3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a BURDENSOME STONE for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</blockquote>
Surely Jerusalem is a burdensome stone to the world in our day. The status of Jerusalem is what the real debate is over between Israel and the Palestinians:
<blockquote>"Camp David, Md. (Reuters)...Sources on all sides said the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both parties as their capital, proved to be the ultimate STUMBLING BLOCK, while progress had been made on other issues such as the nature and borders of a Palestinian state, the fate of Palestinian refugees and of Jewish settlers."</blockquote>
What incredible days we are living in! Even so, the prophecies of Zechariah are not yet being fulfilled. The things we see happening now are, however, significant. They will lead to the building of the temple very soon. They represent a conflict that will not go away until the coming of Christ. There will be a temporary peace in the Middle East in the Tribulation; yet it will vanish quickly (Rev.6:4). As important these events are at Camp David, we must not jump the gun.

There are multitudes of teachers in these perilous times who continue (often with the help of so-called charismatic, prophetic visions, dreams, etc.) to conclude that we are already in the Tribulation period (Revelation chapters 6-19). They are not exactly "historicists" (like Seventh Day Adventists and the early Reformers); they DO believe that there will be a literal Antichrist and a literal fulfillment of most of the events of the Book of Revelation. Yet, the difference between these teachers and traditional futurists is that traditional futurists do not believe we are presently experiencing ANY of the Seal, Trumpet or Vial judgments. Most futurists place these events after the pre-trib rapture (which obviously has not yet occurred). Most futurists believe that the events that have transpired in the 20th century (and especially since the rebirth of Israel) are simply setting the stage for the events of Revelation 6-19. In other words, the closer we get to those events actually being fulfilled, the more it will begin to look as if they ARE being fulfilled in the present. This means the discerning Christian must really be on his or her toes. We must not fall asleep with the scoffers (2Pet.3:3,4, Luke 12:36, 45). Yet, we must also make sure we keep a clear head and do not conclude that the events of Revelation 6-19 (and most of the companion prophecies in the Book of Daniel) are occurring, when they are only "preparing" to occur. Such mistakes in interpretation feed the hungry scoffers. An example of this can be seen in the often reckless interpretations of Irvin Baxter Jr.

Baxter runs "End Time Ministries" and has a daily radio program that is very popular. (He appears to believe the heretical UPC doctrine.) In spite of his errors, he has much prophetic truth and insight, compared to most things that are heard on Christian radio these days. Yet, in my opinion, there is also much in his broadcasts that will leave many people greatly confused.

In 1994, Baxter implied that the prophesied "covenant" with Jerusalem had already been signed on May 19, 1993. He therefore concluded that the final seven year period of the Tribulation had already begun. [I use the phrase "Tribulation period" to refer to the events of Rev.6-19. I also hold that the events of this last period, after the rapture, will last longer than the 7 year period. These final years simply make up the most perilous part of the whole period wherein "nation shall rise against nation."] Baxter writes:
<blockquote>"The confirming of this covenant concerning the status of Jerusalem will be signed and then confirmed. The confirming of this covenant begins a final seven-year period ending with the fateful battle of Armageddon. Is it coincidence that on May 19, 1993, exactly seven years before the year 2000, the Jerusalem Covenant was signed?...A document called the Jerusalem Covenant was drafted by Justice Menhem Elon, Deputy President of the Israeli Supreme Court. It was presented to the Jewish people on Jerusalem Day, May 28, 1992....Isn't it amazing that a covenant concerning Jerusalem would be signed exactly seven years before the year 2000! It appears that the Jerusalem Covenant is the covenant of Daniel 9:27 which the Antichrist will confirm!...Three and one-half years after the confirming of the covenant, the Antichrist will sit in the rebuilt Jewish Temple claiming to be God." ("Mideast Treaty")</blockquote>
The 3.5 years of the Great Tribulation did not occur in the 1990's. Yet, even to this day Irvin Baxter preaches that we are now immediately before the 6TH TRUMPET in the Book of Revelation! This would mean that all the events of Revelation 8 (and half of the events of Rev.9!) have already occurred. A historicist believes in such a manner, but at least he gives an excuse; he takes it all figuratively. But what can we say about Baxter? His interpretation must be a strange, inconsistent mix of literal and figurative interpretation. I do not see how anyone can read the events of Rev. 8 and conclude they have been literally fulfilled. And if they have not been literally fulfilled, there is then no reason to take ANY last day's prophecies literally (e.g. Israel's rebirth, the future rebuilt temple, etc.). Baxter believes we are already in the 4TH SEAL.

I think this kind of Biblical interpretation certainly helps bring about an increase in end time scoffers. It is however refreshing to see people wake up and examine where we stand in history. It is refreshing to see people turn to the Book of Revelation and begin to arise from secular sleep. Christians for centuries (on the basis of literal interpretation) have concluded that Israel would be reborn, that her temple would be rebuilt, and that there would be trouble in the Middle East due to her rebirth by the year 2000. As we see the stage being set for the final prophecies to be fulfilled, the temptation to actually read these preparatory events into the Bible is too great for many to resist. But the Bible, in its Tribulation prophecies, assumes the nation of Israel exists. It also assumes that it has a temple. It does not tell us specifically how these events came or will come about. Baxter (like so many others in this day and age) is wrong. We are not living in the prophesied events of Rev.6-22. I do not even believe we are living in any of the events of Matthew 24, Mark 13 or Luke 21. These prophecies are yet to come in their final applications.

        <h1>UNITARIAN-MODERNISM AND ROMAN CATHOLICISM: HOW THE DEVIL CONTINUALLY USES THE THREAT OF ONE TO INCREASE THE POWER OF THE OTHER</h1>
        <div id="content">
            As fundamental Christians, we must continue to stand our ground against BOTH liberalism and Roman Catholicism. We cannot ally ourselves with either enemy of God's truth:

Isaiah 8:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces...

We greatly need to remember the above warning in our day. In the previous article on this subject, I documented how the Devil used the threat of Roman Catholicism to tempt fundamental Christians to throw their children into the clutches of Unitarianism and their new public schools. Notice the words of some other commentators on this subject:

"For years, it appeared the only strong advocates of state schools in America were the Unitarians of Boston, who denied Christian doctrines and accepted Rousseau's philosophy that negative behavior in society was a result of mis-education - not man's fallen nature. The Unitarians felt that man, who was essentially good, could be saved from the evils of society if he were properly educated....The educational system which was in place was obviously working very well. The majority of Americans were not interested in replacing it. But the Unitarians would not be stopped. Eventually the resolve of the majority began to dissolve as the push for state education continued....In spite of the success that had accompanied individual, missionary, and church educational endeavors, many Christians, encouraged by the Unitarians, began to look longingly toward the state school..." (Susan Adler, "Education in America," Libertyhaven.com)

The Unitarians themselves write:

"There are probably more public schools named for Horace Mann than any other figure in our nationâ€™s history, with the likely exception of George Washington. This honor is well deserved, for Horace Mann was the founder of public schools in America. Not everyone realizes that this important person in our nationâ€™s history was a Unitarian....Through the mentoring of one of the greatest Unitarians of the 19th century, William Ellery Channing, Horace Mann developed a theology that recognized the possibility for goodness that existed in all people....Unlike what some people think, the privilege of receiving a free education paid for by tax dollars is not written into the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, or even in the bill of rights. The commitment to the idea of public education emerged slowly over generations before and after the first public schools instigated by Horace Mann....Unitarians and Universalists have always valued education. It is a crucial part of who we are as a religious people."  ("The Spirit of Public Education," A Sermon by Barbara Wells, co-minister, Paint Branch UU Church, October 7, 2001)

Surely, the submission to Unitarian public education, after a generation, greatly encouraged the acceptance of Unitarian modernism in the Christian colleges and seminaries. Unitarianism and modernism are essentially the same thing:

"Since there is almost complete harmony between the Modernists and Unitarians, it may be well to note the doctrinal teachings of Unitarians, as showing what Modernism is. This statement is taken largely from 'Modern Religious Liberalism,' by John Horsch: 'The Unitarians derive their name from their denial of the trinity of God and the deity of Christ.' They believe 'The doctrine of the sinfulness of man to be a mere figment of the imagination and a source of evil....They are of the opinion that a great moral reformation would result from the rejection of the Biblical doctrine of sin and the acceptance of the idea of inherent human goodness.' The fact is, Unitarians teach that regeneration is not needed to implant the divine life, nor is divine grace needed for the development of life. They teach 'that the natural religion which every person possesses is sufficient for salvation.' According to Unitarians, 'the divine is naturally in man, even in the most degraded and depraved, and it may be developed by natural means, just as the oak is developed from the acorn....'...'Unitarianism is belief in the humanity of God and the divinity of man.' They have no creed and exclude no one from fellowship, because of doctrinal opinions.' They 'are not kindly disposed to the old evangelical faith. They devote their church energies to combating Biblical orthodoxy....' The Unitarian organ, 'The Christian Register,' says editorially, April 15, 1920: 'In all denominations, there is a liberal wing in which the theological differences between them and us is almost nothing.'" (J. M. Stanfield, "Modernism," 1927)

At this point, a really strange thing occurred. After a whole generation of children were brainwashed by ecumenical modernism, fundamental Christians then began to turn to Roman Catholicism as an ALLY in standing against the new threat! To escape the invasion of Roman Catholicism, many Christians had joined with the Unitarians in launching public education. Then, once the monster of Modernism had matured and manifested herself (having being well-fed), many Christians fled to ROME as an ally against it!

In a 1907 "Encyclical," Pope Pius X (1903-14) denounced the writings of some of the "modernists." He supposedly coined the term "modernism." At this point, in the 20th century, many orthodox Christians began to perfume Rome. They SOFTENED their reproofs, and some even associated themselves with Catholicism to battle the new enemy of modernism.

Observing the compromises with Rome occurring around him in 1924, premillennial prophecy writer, D. M. Panton, wrote:

"Profoundly as we are convinced of the ultimate rebuilding of [literal] Babylon...equally profoundly we hold the Papal character of Babylon the Mystic in Revelation xvii....standing as we do on the THRESHOLD OF A RE-ABSORPTION INTO ROME NOW GROWINGLY ADVOCATED IN NEARLY EVERY QUARTER...." ("The Dawn," Aug. 15th, 1924)

Again, in the same year, he wrote:

"The astounding action of the Archbishop of Canterbury in authorizing 'conversations' with the Papacy - a huge stride Romeward - has the approval of great numbers in the Anglican Church....We are confronted once again with the easy leniency which is a fruit of deep ignorance both of the human heart and of the Roman See. Mr. Rattenbury, for example - a foremost Weslyan - says: - 'How is it possible for any body of men who represent one Church of Christians to ignore the existence of what, after all, is the largest body of professing Christians? Is it absolutely incredible that there should be a change of heart in Rome?'...So the ship of faith, sucked by currents of world-opinion inconceivably powerful, drifts rapidly towards the Roman reef....M. Camille Hysmans, the secretary of the International Socialist Conference, said recently in Belgium: - '...the day that the Church becomes MODERNIST I will return to the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church.' So the end hastens..." ("The Dawn Magazine," May 15th, 1924)

Thus, we see that "modernism" tempted many to flee into Rome's consoling bosom! Even the more orthodox, in contending with modernism, tasted the intoxicating wine of Rome. For example, J. Gresham Machen (1881-1937) wrote:

"Yet how great is the common heritage which unites the Roman Catholic Church, with its maintenance of the authority of Holy Scripture and its acceptance of the early creeds, to devout Protestants today! We would not indeed obscure the difference which divides us from Rome. The gulf is indeed profound. But profound as it is, it seems almost trifling compared to the abyss which stands between us and many ministers of our own church." ("Christianity and Liberalism")

"Authority of Holy Scripture"!? There was no ground or need to perfume Rome in this manner. She was not at all worthy of Machen's compliment. The paganism that wears the best disguise is the most dangerous. Machen, however, was not a premillennial fundamentalist. He disliked the term "fundamentalist" and much that was associated with it (calling himself a "Calvinist" instead). Yet, he was identified with the fundamentalists against modernism, and his words are representative of this first move within Protestantism to attempt warmer relations with Rome.

Even some popular fundamentalists staggered with some degree of spiritual intoxication. For example, William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925), in his 1923 defense against modernism, wrote:

"I am defending ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY as it is understood and accepted by the Roman Catholic Church and by all the Evangelical branches of the Protestant Church." ("Orthodox Christianity Verses Modernism")

Is Roman Catholicism "orthodox Christianity"!? Webster defines the word "orthodox" as meaning "sound in the Christian faith" (Webster's 1828). Clearly, even fundamental Christians were softening their rebukes against Rome in an attempt to ally themselves with her against modernism. Therefore, today's modern compromise between evangelicals and Catholics had its roots in this earlier compromise between fundamentalists and Catholics.

The Devil used the threat of Roman Catholicism to feed modernism. Then, he used the threat of modernism to feed Roman Catholicism! The Unitarian movement (modernism, liberalism, neo-orthodoxy, etc.) is a religion that exalts man and diminishes the glory of God. It is essentially paganism merged with nominal Christianity. It therefore mixes well with Roman Catholicism, which is essentially the same thing (though more organized). Today, both monsters are alive and well on planet earth. They are both happy giants. And, of course, they have now linked hands together against fundamentalism.

We must not make any alliances with liberalism or Roman Catholicism (which are now rapidly becoming the same system of "Christianized" paganism). The Devil will surely raise up more "threats" to Christian fundamentalism to tempt Christians to ally themselves with this pagan system with its form of godliness (2 Timothy 3:1-5). But let us fight our battles alone, fearing God, with His help:

Isaiah 8:10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought...
12 Say ye not, A confederacy....neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let HIM be your fear, and let him be your DREAD.
14 And he shall be for a sanctuary...

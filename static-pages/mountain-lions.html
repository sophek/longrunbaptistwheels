Song of Solomon Series

TEXT: Song of Solomon 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:

look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the

mountains of the leopards.

Mark 13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even,

or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:

36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

Matthew 24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;

49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;

50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that

he is not aware of,

51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be

weeping and gnashing of teeth.

"Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana,

from the top of Shenir and Hermon..."

Luke 21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all

these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

Hebrews 9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for

him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

Proverbs 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy

is he.

Psalms 36:6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains...

Hebrews 11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as

seeing him who is invisible.

Jeremiah 18:14 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the

field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?

15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have

caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast

up;

Mark 9:2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them

up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

2 Peter 1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the

holy mount.

19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy...

"â€¦from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards."

Hebrews 11:37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the

sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in

dens and caves of the earth.

Matthew 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear,

that preach ye upon the housetops.

28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him

which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

2 Timothy 4:10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,

16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not

be laid to their charge.

17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching

might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the

mouth of the lion.

2 Timothy 3:11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra;

what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

Amos 3:12 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs,

or a piece of an ear...

Luke 21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with

surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these

things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

"...that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much

wine, teachers of good things; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their

husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their

own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."

1 Timothy 5:6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

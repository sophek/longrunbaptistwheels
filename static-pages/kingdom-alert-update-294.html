IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK!
************************
During the time my wife's father passed away, she miscarried our new baby at 4 months. I have also had some computer problems. There have also been some great blessings at our church. We welcomed another family from out of state (praise the Lord for the Berzins!), and we are moving along with the church building, etc. (we praise the Lord for those He stirred up to help us). We have some final work to do (install the new AC, finish carpeting, etc.). But it is painted (the Lord sent us a painter - Brother Larry!), and we trust the Lord will finish what He started in this building, and in the true church, His spiritual house. My wife is now well, and is very busy again. Our cold winter in Texas appears to be past. I pray these articles in the Kingdom Alert, and our audio sermons, will encourage and edify you. It is a blessing to be back writing.

WORLD NET DAILY AND THE AV
********************************
WND is to be praised for correcting their ad on the Geneva Version. They had originally stated that the AV was not on the Mayflower. After showing them the documentation, they made my letter the letter of the week, and changed the wording of their ad. This reveals that they are fair in such matters. Yet, I have been increasingly disturbed by WND's showcasing of immodest pictures and articles containing practical pornography. WND is not a Christian-friendly news site in this regard. Hopefully they will consider improving in this area if enough people contact them about it.

**********************************
CHRISTIANS AND SINFUL MOVIES
**********************************
Unbelievable things are happening in regard to Christians and Hollywood. A few years ago, I predicted that it would not be long before many leaders would actually defend nudity. It has happened, and I guess I didn't believe myself, because I am shocked. The addiction to bloody gore and profanity has led them down the slippery slope into pornography. I also have some extensive email debates with various Christian and conservative leaders on this subject. But there is no room in this issue. To be continued...

*****************************
A RESPONSE TO "BIBLIOTHECA SACRA" (JANUARY-MARCH, 2007), "DOES THE VICE LIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS 6:9-10 REFER TO BELIEVERS OR UNBELIEVERS?"
*****************************
Rene A. Lopez is the pastor of a church in Dallas, Texas; he is completing his work on a doctorate at Dallas Theological Seminary. He has written an article in the latest "Bibliotheca Sacra" (a theological quarterly published by DTS) that quotes from my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?," and attempts to refute it. Pastor Lopez avoids some of the common errors in interpreting 1 Corinthians 6; nevertheless, he also greatly neutralizes this important warning to believers. Notice the Bible passage that is the subject of his article:

1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

Pastor Lopez begins by listing the various interpretations of this important warning:

"Scholars have presented a number of interpretations of this passage. These views include the following:
(a) believers who commit these sins will lose their salvation,
(b) people who commit these sins show they were not saved in the first place,
(c) believers who commit these sins will lose fellowship with the Lord,
(d) believers who commit these sins will miss the millennial kingdom, though they will have eternal life, and,
(e) believers who commit these sins will lose rewards in heaven.
This article examines these views and then presents a sixth view."

Lopez dismisses the first view (Arminianism) by noting that it does not harmonize with the various Scriptures that teach unconditional inheritance or eternal security of the believer by faith alone.

He dismisses the second view (Reformed) by showing that 1 Corinthians 5:9-12 (and 3:1-2, 6:8,18, etc.) gives an identical list of sins as those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6, without stating a duration of practice. He argues that there is no hint in the passage that Paul is addressing mere professors.

The third view (c) is advocated by R.T. Kendall. Kendall rightly believes in the eschatological (future) millennial kingdom; yet he interprets the "kingdom of God" in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 to be God's fellowship with believers. Lopez rightly shows that the same words elsewhere (1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21) refer to an eschatological inheritance. Therefore, although fellowship is certainly lost when believers sin, Lopez does not believe that this view fits the context.

The fourth view (missing the millennial kingdom) is next examined by Lopez. He writes:

"In this view Paul was addressing disobedient believers (1 Cor.1:11-12; 3:1-9; 4:18; 5:1-5; 6:1-20; 11:18) who will miss entering the kingdom but will remain eternally saved. [footnote, Faust, 'The Rod' p. 72). Advocates of this view correctly maintain that eternal life is a free gift that comes by faith alone. But they add that entrance into the millennium is based on having lived a life of obedienceâ€¦If carnal, disobedient believers will not be on the earth during the millennium, where will they be? Strangely, advocates of this view say that carnal believers will be banished to hades 'in the center of the earth.' ['The Rod,' p. 113] Then, 'after the millennium, the banished Christians will be restored to endless bliss and the unbelievers will perish forever in the Lake of Fire.' ['The Rod,' p.113]â€¦It is remarkably strange - and unbiblical - to think that some believers will be in hades along with unbelievers for one thousand years!"

Lopez attempts to refute this view by simply calling it "strange." Yet, we serve a holy God who is a consuming fire. Conservative Christians believe that the Lord will send unbelievers to the Lake for Fire, and that even after thirty million years of conscious suffering, He will continue to punish them forever in endless torment. I fail to see how my view could be called "strange" when weighed alongside these other fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures:

Hosea 8:12 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a STRANGE THING.

Ezekiel 20:48 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
49 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, DOTH HE NOT SPEAK PARABLES?

A just God who torments a lost sinner forever would reasonably be expected to have some serious consequences for His own sons who bring reproach upon His name through their dishonesty, carnality, hatred, etc. The Scriptures certainly concur with this understanding:

1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

Hebrews 10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

Lopez continues to add another objection:

"...The claim that believers can miss the kingdom contradicts various passages. First Corinthians 15:50-54 does not exclude any believers in the church age from being in the millennium..."

Let us take a look at these verses:

1 Corinthians 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

Lopez, in his short article, does not interact or respond to the answers already provided in my book to these verses. I have a whole chapter called "Objections Answered." I prove, with abundant examples, that Biblical promises (blessings or warnings) must be read in light of the qualifications and conditions stated in context, and elsewhere, in the Scriptures. For example, on the surface, 1 John 5:14-15 appears to teach that anything a believer asks, that is in accordance with God's will, will be granted, with no other qualifications:

1 John 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
15 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

However, a few chapters earlier, we are taught that our obedience also plays a role in whether or not we receive from God:

1 John 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

A Christian, ignoring 1 John 3:22, might embrace 1 John 5:14-15 or Mark 11:24, and conclude that prayers in the Lord's will are automatically granted through faith alone:

Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

Another Christian might determine that "asking" is the only condition on the basis of Matthew 7:7:

Matthew 7:7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

However, as we have seen, the Bible is filled with warnings reminding us that our obedience will often play a crucial role in whether prayers are granted (Proverbs 15:29, 28:9, 1 John 3:22, etc.).

What would Pastor Lopez teach a church member who, on the basis of Matthew 7:7 and Mark 11:24, believed that all prayers are automatically granted to anyone who simply asks and believes? Surely, he would teach them that Bible promises must be interpreted in light of all the Scriptures that speak on the subject. In the same manner, Bible promises concerning blessings at the coming of the Lord must be interpreted in light of the many Scriptures that warn of negative consequences for not being ready for it!

Are we called to submit to "every" ordinance of man (1 Peter 2:13), absolutely, without exception? If so, Peter disobeyed his own teaching (Acts 5:29). God expects us to read His whole Book and notice the exceptions to general commands and promises.

The Old Testament likewise presents many promises to the Israelites, with no conditions stated in the context:

Numbers 13:2 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I GIVE UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

There are no conditions revealed in these positive statements to Israel. The Israelites could have comforted one another with such words. Nevertheless, the majority of those Israelites who had been "given" the land and the promise never made it over (Numbers 14:23). Paul continually reminds Christians of these things (1 Corinthians 10:11-12, Hebrews, chapters 3 and 4).

The Bible is filled with warnings to believers about death (Romans 6:16, 8:13, Galatians 6:8, etc.). To escape these warnings, those who object to millennial exclusion, apply these warnings to death in this life only.

Yet, it would be presumptuous to conclude that every believer who has died early is a greater sinner than others who have been given longer lives. Theologians would tell us that these warnings of death are not absolute, but general promises. I do not believe that all of these warnings apply to death in this life only. However, for the sake of argument, we can see that the theologians who object to millennial exclusion are very quick to teach that certain promises (especially promises of death or curses) must be qualified or applied in a limited fashion. Why then do they automatically apply all the blessings in an absolute, unqualified sense? There is indeed a promise of being changed, and of being glorified in the presence of Jesus at His coming. But what about the warning in the same Epistle?:

1 Corinthians 16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. [Cursed when the Lord comes]

Do all believers love the Lord? Jesus teaches that such love is manifested by obedience to His commandments (John 14:15, 21).

Notice another warning:

1 Corinthians 15:2 By which also ye are saved, IF ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

There are many similar warnings in 1 Corinthians (chapters 3, 6, 9, 11, etc.). It is wresting the Scriptures to embrace blessings without heeding their warnings. Universalists are known for this practice. They use many Scriptures that appear, at face value, to teach that every man (even unbelievers) will be ultimately saved; some of these "proof-texts" are in this very Epistle (1 Corinthians 4:5, 15:22, 51-52). I wonder how Pastor Lopez would school these Universalists? I would like to hear him teach them that they have no right to rashly interpret certain promises in an unqualified manner. He will tell them that "the dead" cannot mean "all" of the dead (unbelievers included). He will tell them that they must interpret these phrases by the rest of the Scriptures. I would tell Pastor Lopez to take at least a spoonful of his own medicine.

Lastly, Pastor Lopez argues:

"1 Thessalonians 5:5-10 does not distinguish immoral believers who will miss the kingdom."

This is certainly a stretch. Notice the verses:

1 Thessalonians 5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

Lopez believes that verse 10 teaches that even if Christians sleep "morally," (i.e. falling into great sin) they will live with Jesus in the Millennium. However, Lopez is assuming that the "sleep" in verse 10 is not referring back to the physical sleep referenced in chapter 4. Lopez would appeal to the Greek of verse 6. But the word (or a form of it) is used elsewhere to refer to physical sleep (Mark 4:38). Therefore, we conclude that the word means "sleep," nothing less, nothing more. A few verses earlier, Paul clearly explained what would happen to believers who fall asleep morally. They will be destroyed at the Lord's coming:

1 Thessalonians 5:2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

The exhortation in verse 6 would mean nothing if it did not mean that believers may fall asleep and meet the Lord as a thief in the night! We should not do so. There is no excuse for it. If we are morally awake, sober and watching, it does not matter if we are physically alive or dead (v. 10); we shall live together with the Lord in glory during the Millennium. But if we fall asleep morally, refusing to walk in our high calling, the Lord will meet us with destruction:

Luke 12:39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
41 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.

The Lord meeting a believer as a destroyer is contrary to all that the Lord intends for believers. Nevertheless, many believers will choose to be drunken with the spirit of this world. Paul teaches that the Lord will indeed meet these believers as an Avenger (1 Thessalonians 4:6).

Before concluding, how, may we ask, does Pastor Lopez interpret the warning in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10? After dismissing the "loss of rewards" view (the idea that unfaithful believers "enter," but do not "inherit" the kingdom), Lopez teaches that the verses are simply an "exhortation" to believers to live like saints. In his view, Paul's mention of the kingdom is for the purpose of reminding the believers of the destiny of the unbeliever, so they will live like believers. He does not view it as a warning:

"..several commentators suggest that Paul's point in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 could be summarized in this way: 'You are doing wrong. Wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore you will not inherit the kingdom.' However, as is being proposed here, Paul was giving an exhortation, not a warning. It is as if he were writing, 'You are doing wrong. Wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God. But you are not wrongdoers (positionally). Paul's words were a rhetorical device..."

Of course, almost anything could be denied with this type of interpretation. For example, a Universalist might argue:

"The final Lake of Fire is only for devils, and the so-called warnings to unbelievers are simply exhortations for men not to live like demons. Devils are destined for the Lake of Fire, but men are created to glorify God. The Bible is warning unbelievers that they are not devils, they are men. They should live like men. It is a rhetorical device."

No, unbelievers are warned that if they continue to reject Jesus, they will be eternally damned. And Paul also warns believers not to be deceived about their consequences during the millennium:

1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? BE NOT DECEIVED: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

Were they in danger of being deceived about the fact that unbelievers will not inherit the kingdom? No, I do not think the Corinthians were embracing Universalism! It makes more sense to conclude that they were in danger of thinking that they could sin like unbelievers, now that they are saved, and yet will suffer no consequences. Paul writes them to correct this common deception. He argues the same way in Ephesians 5:

Ephesians 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 LET NO MAN DECEIVE YOU WITH VAIN WORDS: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

Pastor Lopez has no real answer for Paul's warning about deception. In 15 pages of small print, Lopez does not even refer to the words! Yet, these words appear right in the middle of 1 Corinthians 6:9.

Some of these saints had escaped such sins as sodomy, drunkenness, etc. On the other hand, others were presently guilty of defrauding their brethren:

1 Corinthians 6:8 Nay, ye do wrong, and DEFRAUD, and that your brethren.
9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
10 Nor THIEVES, nor COVETOUS, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

A defrauder of the brethren is a covetous thief!Â  And defrauders will be judged by the Lord at His appearing:

1 Thessalonians 4:5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that THE LORD IS THE AVENGER OF ALL SUCH, as we also have FOREWARNED you and testified.
7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

In this passage, we have almost the exact same context as 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. Believers should not walk like unbelieving Gentiles. A believer has been called to holiness. But if a believer chooses to walk like a lost Gentile, and defrauds his brother, he will meet the Lord as an avenger. And this is a "warning" (i.e. "forewarned"), not just an exhortation or rhetorical device! In 1 Corinthians 6, Paul uses the phrase "shall not inherit the kingdom of God." In 1 Thessalonians 4, he states the same truth with different details. Those who do not inherit the kingdom of God will meet the Lord as an avenger. This reminds us of the "terror" at the Judgment Seat of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:9-11.

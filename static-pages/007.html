Addicted to the Ministry

1Co 16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

So few Christians realize how many opportunities there are to serve the Lord! A friend of mine showed me the above verse years ago, and I have never forgotten it. It is so powerful! Oh, to have Bible believing churches filled with such people! What a light to the lost these churches would be.

Many people ask after they get saved, or when they have a revival in their life what they can do to serve the Lord. A lot of times they want the answer to be something great, like go be a missionary, start a world wide Bible study program, get a radio program etc. The answer though, is nowhere near t= hat. The answer is to serve right where you are. Even if the Lord has called you to do one of these things one day, your training ground is still where you live now. The question that should be asked is "Lord, how can I be a blessing where I am? In my home, in my family, with my friends, and in my church?" Christian, if you can't be a blessing where you are, you will NEVER be a blessing anywhere else.

It should be your daily goal to make your home a place of comfort and refreshment for your family. To keep things clean and organized, full of sweet, not bitter or harsh, words, full of laughter and cheerfulness. Your goal sh= ould be to meet the needs of your friends and family, encouraging and helping them in every way you can. They would be so strengthened if they had you there to always teach and admonish them in the Lord!

Ask any pastor, and he will tell you, that there is so many opportunities to serve God in your church! Be willing to be a part of any ministry, as long as you are serving! If you really have a heart to do great things for God one day, He may look to the small ministries you have had in your life, to see if you were faithful and cheerful in them.

Here are a few of the ministries that we have in our church, I am sure that you will have similar ones: Soul winning and street witnessing, Sunday school classes, the bus ministry, the church cleaning crew, nursery and toddler class, help needed to keep the grass mowed and grounds upkeeping, copying and folding tracts, church bulletins, singing in the choir, helping the sick, praying for the pastor and teachers, and of course attending services and supporting our churches vision with our tithes and offerings.

Whatever you do, don't serve with a grumbling heart! Don't get upset when it is your turn to take nursery (I just did this last week! Why am I being asked again?) or cleaning (I can't believe how dirty these people are! Someone needs to tell them&) or any other thing! Take your ministry joyfully, ready to serve the Lord. "God loveth a cheerful giver."

Many large churches are lacking in helpers, people who addict themselves to the ministry. They allow others to do nursery and all of these other ministries, and simply take their place in the pew each Sunday. You are needed! Your hands could be used for much good! Involve yourself and your children in the church. Your family will be strengthened because of service. If family time is an issue, then adopt ministries that can be done as a family! All I have to do is look at the joyful sweet faces of the people in my church who are serving for Jesus and know that their spiritual lives are being rewarded. You just never know how much you can grow in the Lord until you place your self at His service.

"I would not have the restless will that hurries to and fro,
Seeking for some great thing to do, Or wondrous thing to know;
I would be guided as a child, And led where'er I go.
I ask thee for the daily strength, To none that ask denied,
A mind to blend with outward life, While keeping at thy side;
Content to fill a little space, If thou be glorified."

The Dangers of White Sugar

About 10 years ago I learned about the dangers of common table sugar to a persons health. At that time I decided to stop using any products that contained sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Instead I use whole forms of sugar such as honey, pure maple syrup, agave nectar, brown rice syrup, sucanat, etc. I have used these products in baking with wonderful results.

Here is what one health expert says about sugar:

"Sugar is a major carbohydrate source but is completely devoid of protein, vitamins, and minerals and is not considered nutritious. Refined white sugar& [is] made from either sugar cane or sugar beet. White sugar contains no vitamins or minerals. The B vitamins needed for its assimilation must be obtained from other sources, either foods or supplements. Sugar leads to an imbalance in the calcium-phosphorus relationship. Sugar may also be a contributing factor in the development of overweight, diabetes, arthritis, tooth decay, pyorrhea, asthma, mental illness, nervous disorders, and low blood sugar. Natural sources of sugar, such as fruits, usually contain adequate supplies of vitamins essential for digestion and metabolism."
-Nutrition Almanac

In other words, when you eat white sugar or high fructose corn syrup, you are eating a product that has been totally refined. The manufacturer has taken out every bit of natural nutrition that was originally in the product, and has left you with a sweet nutritional "0" that actually requires vitamins to assimilate it, and therefore depletes your bodies natural vitamin stores. All other natural sugars have their own vitamins intact. Honey has small amounts of minerals, vitamins C,D, and E, and also has traces of the B-complex vitamins.

"Natural sugar cane, just like natural salt, has vitamins and minerals in it, but commercial refining takes all its benefits away and leaves us with a good-tasting, slow-working poison. Refined sugar in frequent high doses can cause diabetes, hypoglycemia, tooth decay, mental problems, learning disabilities, and vitamin-B shortage."
-Greater Health God's Way, by Stormie Omartian

See why it is so dangerous to allow your body to be continually depleted of B vitamins:

"The B-complex vitamins are active in providing the body with energy, basically by converting carbohydrates into glucose, which the body "burns" to produce energy. They are vital in the metabolism of fats and protein. In addition, the B vitamins are necessary for normal functioning of the nervous system and may be the single most important factor for health of the nerves. They are essential for maintenance of muscle tone in the gastrointestinal tract and for the health of skin, hair, eyes, mouth, and liver."
-Nutrition Almanac

"The 13 or more B vitamins are so meagerly supplied in the American diet that almost every American lacks some of them. If a person is tired, irritable, nervous, depressed, or even suicidal, suspect a vitamin B deficiency& One reason there is so much B-vitamin deficiency in the American population is that Americans eat so many processed foods from which the B vitamins have often been removed. Another reason for widespread deficiency is the high amount of sugar consumed. Sugar and alcohol destroy the B-complex vitamins."
-Nutrition Almanac

One doesn't have to look far to see the disastrous results in a body continually allowed to consume refined sugar. Commit to making some changes in your families diet as you prepare meals for them. Their bodies will thank you for it!

Kristy's Basic Bread Recipe
2 Â¾ cups warm water
1/3 cup oil
1/3 cup honey
1 T salt
Mix together, and add 2 Â½ cups flour.
1 T instant yeast

Continue to add more flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Kneed for 10 minutes by hand or less time if you have a electric dough mixer. Add a little flour at a time when the dough begins to feel too sticky.
Shape into loaves, and let rise until size doubles.

This is a great recipe. I have been using it since a dear sister in the Lord (and mother of 10, soon to be 11!), Kristy was the guest at my church's Homemaker's Fellowship. At this fellowship, we meet together the second Thursday of every month to create and eat a meal from a new recipe, discuss homemaking issues, as well as how we are to be godly wives and mothers.

This basic bread recipe will make 2 loaves of bread. I use it for everything! I make my pizza crusts out of it, and also make cinnamon rolls by rolli= ng the dough onto a pizza pan, spreading honey onto the dough, then add cinnamon, walnuts and raisins. Roll the dough starting at one end into a large loaf. You could just cook it at this point and have cinnamon bread! Or use dental floss to "slice" the dough into 1 inch rolls by placing the dental floss under the dough, and pull the ends together, and over one another, almost like you were tying a knot, until it slices the dough. If you cut it with a knife, you will loose half of the honey etc. from the roll! Cook bread, pizza dough, and/or cinnamon rolls at 350 degrees until done (normally abou= t 15 to 20 minutes for the pizza dough and cinnamon rolls, 30 to 45 for the bread.

Make a topping for the cinnamon rolls by blending 8 oz. cream cheese with 1/3 cup honey (sweeten more or less to taste). Add a tablespoon or two of yogurt to thin topping if desired. Sometimes I like to eat cinnamon rolls hot with fresh butter on top!

Optional: Make herb bread by adding a half teaspoon of basil, oregano, and= rosemary to dough while kneading. Shape into round loaves and serve hot with a bowl of olive oil, Balsamic vinegar, and fresh ground pepper for dipping.

An Ernest Tract for Christians from Long Ago
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(Note: This tract was taken out of a book called "Esther Ried" written by I= sabella Alden in the late 1800's. Esther Ried is a godly Christian novel, very unlike many of the Harlequin type romance novels you will find in today's "Christian" fiction. I have read many of Isabella Alden's books, and have found all that I have read to be wonderful books, made to edify and bless C= hristians, with the purpose of making them look deeper into their Christian walk. Some books, like "Tip Lewis and His Lamp" and "Three People" are great to read with children.)

"Dear Friend: are you a Christian? What have you done today for Christ? Are the friends with whom you have been talking traveling toward the New Jerusalem? Did you compare notes with them as to how you were all prospering on the way? Is that stranger by your side a fellow pilgrim? Did you ask him if he would be? Have you been careful to recommend the religion of Jesus Christ by your words, by your acts, by your looks, this day? If danger comes to you, have you this day asked Christ to be your helper? If death comes to you this night, are you prepared to give up you account? What would your record of this last day be? A blank? What! Have you done nothing for the Master? Then what have you done against him? Nothing? Nay, verily! Is not the Bible doctrine, He that is not for me is against me?

"Remember that every neglected opportunity, every idle word, every wrong th= ought of yours has been written down this day. You cannot take back the thoughts or words; you cannot recall the opportunity. This day, with all its mistakes and blots and mars, you can never live over again. It must go up to the judgment just as it is. Have you begged the blood of Jesus to be spread over it all? Have you resolved that no other day shall witness a repetition of the same mistakes? Have you resolved in your own strength or in His?"

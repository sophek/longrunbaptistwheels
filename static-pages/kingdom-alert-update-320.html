        <h1>PROPHECY WATCH - KAU#320</h1>
        <div id="content">
            Dear Friends,

May the Lord bless you with a wonderful New Year. May you go forth to battle, and do some spiritual "house cleaning," and gain many victories (2 Sam.11:1)!

Colossians 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

OUR ANNUAL PROPHECY WATCH:

Tonight, at 8:00pm (Texas time), we will be broadcasting our live video feed of our annual Prophecy Watch, where we intend to stir up our minds about the coming of Jesus: http://www.kingdombaptist.org

Our subject tonight will be: "The Antichrist: His Lies, His Kingdom and His Mark."

THE FAUST SISTERS:

My young daughters have been enjoying ministering with their music. They are still learning their instruments, and such; but I pray they will be a blessing to you! You can view them online at:

Or, just search under "Faust Sisters"

RECENT SERMONS:

We continue to broadcast our recent sermons live, and post them on our web site; and on Sermon Audio:

http://www.sermonaudio.com/search.asp?SpeakerOnly=true&amp;currSection=sermonsspeaker&amp;keyword=Joey^Faust

We are preaching from Ephesians 6, and 1 Corinthians 6, for the Lord's Day messages, and from Romans 12 on Thursday nights. Some recent titles include:

"Sentimental, Sinful Clutter."
"Finding the Will of God"
"God is For Your Body."
"Free the Women."
"How Children Can Reign."
"The Sin of Casually Interpreting."
"Should We Obey the Old Testament?"
"The Blasphemy of Bambi."

And you will also find the entire series of sermons on all the sins of exclusion mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6.

NEW BOOK COMING:

I have many writing projects "in the works," but I think the 2011, 400 year anniversary of the King James Bible has motivated me to finish at least one of them! It will be titled:

"400 Years of KJV Onlyism: The History of the King James Bible Only Movement."

Please pray that I will not be hindered in getting this out in the next few weeks, and that the Lord will bless it, and cause many to see how extensive and vast has been the view that the Authorized Version is the preserved, inerrant, written Word of God.

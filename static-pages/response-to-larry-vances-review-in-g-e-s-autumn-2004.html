<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the Grace Evangelical Society (G.E.S.), or Larry Vance, I will provide this brief introduction. The stated purpose of G.E.S. is to, "promote the clear proclamation of God's free salvation through faith alone in Christ alone, which is properly correlated with and distinguished from issues related to discipleship." This organization is to be commended for placing a salty roadblock in the way of the modern movement to "Romanize the Gospel" into salvation through WORKS (i.e. confusing positional salvation with discipleship, the gift with the prize, etc.). They have an annual conference that is held in Dallas-Fort Worth. Their journal is edited by Bob Wilkin (a bright, kind brother). Some of the members of G.E.S. advocate the basic teachings presented in my book, "The Rod: Will God Spare It?" They believe in exclusion from the Millennial Kingdom for unrepentant believers, the possibility of physical chastisement at the Judgment Seat, and even temporary "Gehenna" (i.e. Hell) for some believers. Most of the members, while shying away from the above views, would nevertheless still apply the warnings in Hebrews, and the "outer darkness" of Matthew 25:30, to TRUE BELIEVERS. Yet, they hold to the view that these warnings (since they are in the midst of parables or figurative language) are only figurative in nature (a view, however, that is refuted by simply noticing the many LITERAL warnings already fulfilled in Scripture that are, nevertheless, also couched in parabolic language). The rest of these members would hold that ALL believers gain entrance into the Millennial Kingdom, and that the above warnings refer only to the "emotional" suffering of shame (or perhaps being barred from the banquet table). This is the view of Zane Hodges and Bob Wilkin (the editor of the G.E.S. Journal, who on most issues follows the teachings of Hodges).</p>
<p>Larry M. Vance teaches at Pensacola Bible Institute in Florida (he is associated with Peter Ruckman). He is the author of the mammoth (788 page) work, "The Other Side of Calvinism" (1991, 1999). This book is referenced many times by Dave Hunt in his new book, "What Love Is This?". Vance's review of my book is one of the few reviews that actually give some evidence that the reviewer has read more than the bold print at the start of each chapter (there is a fleshly tendency in man to naturally shun the light of true accountability).</p>
<p>Vance agrees with G.E.S. on the freeness of the Gospel (against the Reformed Calvinist's "Lordship salvation"). However, his interpretation of many of the warning passages is radically different from the members of G.E.S.</p>
<p><strong>Vance's Review</strong></p>
<p>I am in full agreement with the first four paragraph's of Vance's review of my book. It is simply descriptive information. In the fifth paragraph, there are some statements that might be confusing to some readers. Vance writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The second part of the book is a lengthy chapter on 'Objections and Questions Answered.' But in addition to answering what he perceives as potential objections, Faust introduces other details of his 'accountability' system: Some Christians in 1 Thessalonians 4 will not always be with the Lord (pp.249-56)..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, as Vance notes earlier, I hold that every true believer (regardless of his or her status during the Millennial Age) will always be with the Lord throughout eternity. However, I do show that the wording of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 (in comparison to other Scriptures) need not imply that "every" believer (regardless of whether he is as steadfast as the Thessalonians) will spend the Millennium with Jesus. Thus far, Vance does not mention any of the Biblical grounds for my various assertions, nor does he offer any arguments in refutation.</p>
<p>It is in his sixth paragraph that Vance makes his first negative statement. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The third part of the book consists of three chapters (totaling almost 100 pages) containing quotes from men like George Peters, Robert Govett, J.R. Graves, G.H. Pember, Oswald J. Smith, Robert Ketcham, William H. Griffith Thomas, Philip Mauro, I.M. Haldeman, Hudson Taylor, J.A. Seiss, Watchman Nee, Robert Neighbour, D.M. Panton, and assorted Church Fathers on 'accountability truth in history.' No evidence is presented that any of these men taught EXACTLY what Faust believes..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, this statement is meaningless, since there are hardly two Christians in history that can be found to agree in every jot and tittle of every subject. Yet, the majority of these Christians listed in my book (with biographical information and lengthy excerpts from their own writings) did teach exactly what I STATED that they taught at the head of the list: "A Sample of Premillennialists Who Believed in Kingdom Exclusion and/or Corporal Chastisement at the Judgment Seat of Christ." Therefore, popular premillennialists such as Robert Govett, D.M. Panton, G.H. Pember, S.S. Craig, H.W. Fry, Watchman Nee, A.G. Tilney, Col. Poynder, etc. believed in Millennial exclusion, physical chastisement, AND temporary banishment to the underworld (to be restored on the Last Day at the Great White Throne). To argue that this is not EXACTLY what is taught in my book is to appear dishonest. Then, there are popular Baptist leaders like R.E. Neighbour, Robert Ketcham, I.M. Haldeman, and scores of others, who certainly taught physical chastisement at the Judgment Seat, as well as an undefined Millennial exclusion. I base my teachings strictly on the King James Bible text; therefore, I sometimes differ from these early scholars on some minor details. But to make the claim that these writers do not "exactly" agree with me, appears to be obfuscation. It gives the impression that I am trying to "pull a fast one." And this often works, since this age of Christians rarely reads (and when many do, it is often a work of fiction, NOT a detailed study of theology or eschatology).</p>
<p>To his credit (unlike others who have tried to use this straw man), Vance adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...but there is no question that many of them did teach SOME of what Faust believes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen to that! But why not define the "SOME" (e.g. chastisement at the Judgment Seat, Millennial exclusion, weeping and gnashing of teeth, outer darkness, restoration after the Millennium, etc.)? I can understand this need to obscure the history I have brought to light. I have had Christian history students (and even professors) tell me in bewilderment that they did not know that many of these men taught these views (for a quick example, see Van Impe's video on my book). This is why I make the claim that there has been a BURIAL of older, premillennial prophetic material. Men like Pember and Peters are praised, yet their works are not offered in school bookstores or libraries (though they have been back in print for years). Next, Vance writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Of course, many other premillennial writers could be cited to the contrary, and all amillennialists and postmillennialists could gather their own quotations in support of their position."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vance misses the whole point here. I plainly show in my book WHY I am listing the history (how could he miss it?). I write:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...no one should be found committing the logical fallacy of an ad populum argument. The Holy Bible is the final authority. Needless to say, the doctrine of selective-resurrection [into the Millennium] WILL HARDLY EVER GET A FAIR HEARING FROM SCRIPTURE ALONE IF MODERN OPPONENTS OF THE VIEW, EITHER DECEITFULLY OR IGNORANTLY, CONTINUE TO OBSCURE THE TESTIMONIES OF ITS CHIEF DEFENDERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CLAIMING THE VIEW HAS NEVER BEEN POPULAR. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT EVERY CHRISTIAN SHOULD BE PROPERLY INFORMED CONCERNING THE PREVALENCE OF THE DOCTRINE...THAT ALL MAY INDEED JUDGE FREELY FROM SCRIPTURE CONCERNING ITS VALIDITY." (pp.301-2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years before (and during) the writing of my book, I dealt with hundreds of Baptists and premillennialists around the world who responded to the views (later presented in my book) on our church website. The NUMBER ONE objection was: "If this is true, THEN WHY HAVEN'T OTHER CHRISTIANS SEEN THESE TRUTHS BEFORE NOW?" This number one objection is therefore dealt with, and FULLY dismantled at the latter end of my book. Vance argues that other premillennialists can also provide a list of historic Christians who share their views. I state the same thing in my book! But the difference between my list of Christians, and a list by other premillennialists, is that NO ONE DOUBTS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHRISTIANS IN HISTORY THAT HAVE TAUGHT STANDARD SCOFIELDISM (i.e. no chastisement at the Judgment Seat for any Christian). However, based on years of experience teaching these truths on the Internet, on the street, and at church, I know that this is the FIRST argument made about Kingdom exclusion once the weight of the Scriptures begins to press upon the mind: "But who has ever taught such a thing?"</p>
<p>Furthermore (and Vance omits any mention of this), I show in my book that, at times, earlier premillennialists (especially the futurists) who shared the views of my book were more prevalent than the others! But all this has been reversed today. THIS FACT appears practically UNKNOWN by the majority of modern prophetic teachers and students. When these things are properly understood (as demonstrated in my book), the objections concerning history and "fruit" are cleared away. These doctrines of accountability, presented in my book, have already brought forth fruit in history. Reviewers and critics love to camp against my historical section; however, if I would have left out the material, almost every one of them would have made the alleged "obscurity" of the doctrine one of their main objections! The proof of this is that, even in the face of my documentation, reviewers STILL have made this objection, neglecting to read this part of my book! Readers of past critiques and reviews will remember those writers who wrote something to the effect of, "Pember or Nee never taught anything like this!" When they said this, they exposed themselves to be ignorant of, not only the works of men like Pember and Nee, but of the TABLE OF CONTENTS of my book - the book they were supposed to be "reviewing" for their readers! The fact is, many Bible teachers are appearing either ignorant or dishonest by the open presentation of this material in my historical section. The truth of the matter is that MOST OF THEM did not know that these men believed these things. They had heard of some modern folks teaching that outer darkness in Matthew 25:30 could apply to some unfaithful Christians. But they dismissed this teaching as something new and nutty. They had absolutely no idea that so many of the great men they have been quoting for years actually believed these things. Also, most of them had never heard of men like Robert Govett, etc., even though in their own day, they were esteemed as the foremost premillennial interpreters. And many would obviously like this historical material to remain exactly where it was before my book revived it - buried in the old books!</p>
<p>Let us now deal with Vance's seventh paragraph. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The most objectionable thing about Faust's 'accountability truth' is that 'every Christian must therefore come into contact with the fire that issues out before the Lord's throne'..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand why such a thing might be "objectionable" to this modern, "TV Guide" generation. It is the generation that is almost wholly ignorant of the Scriptures. It forms its views based upon fickle, flimsy whims and feelings. But I cannot help but wonder why this is so "objectionable" to a King James Bible believer. In the Old Testament, the FIRE OF GOD did not just fall on SODOM, it also fell on God's PEOPLE:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Leviticus 10:1</strong></em> And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. 2 And there went out FIRE FROM THE LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Numbers 11:1</strong></em> And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the FIRE OF THE LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. 2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Numbers 16:35</strong></em> And there came out a FIRE FROM THE LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these very Scriptures revealing the "terror of the Lord" before us, we then have the Holy Ghost warning New Testament saints that we better not forget them!:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>1 Corinthians 10:10</strong></em> Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. 11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Testament Christians are warned that God is STILL a consuming fire:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Hebrews 12:28</strong></em> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: 29 For OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is God (who slew Ananias and Sapphira, in Acts 5), and MANY of the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:30) somehow forbidden to slay His people by fire in this age, if He so desires?:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Luke 12:4</strong></em> And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be admitted by every professing Bible believer that God can still drop His fire on any saint if He so pleases. And if it be admitted that He can slay any Christian by HIS FIRE, in this life (in this age of His patience), where is the Scripture that states that He cannot slay unfaithful Christians by this same fire BEFORE HIS THRONE OF JUDGMENT, on the day of reward according to works? Knowing the TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men (2 Corinthians 5:9-11, Revelation 2:11)!</p>
<p>Vance continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>"He bases this on a misinterpretation of 'the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is' (1 Cor 3:13)..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vance does not attempt to counter the arguments I provided for my view. For example, one argument offered is that in regard to Biblical warning passages, even if they are framed in parabolic or symbolic language, they are LITERAL in their main threat (to believers or unbelievers). For example, in Matthew 13, Jesus gives the Parable of the Tares. It is obviously a PARABLE.. But would Vance maintain that the Tares being "burned" represents only a symbolic burning? Is not the burning LITERAL when Jesus gives the interpretation of the parable? This argument is developed in my book in detail. Furthermore, Vance does not deal with 1 Corinthians 3:16-17, which is Paul's CONCLUSION, and therefore, his interpretation of the figures:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:15</strong> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 17 If any man defile the temple of God, HIM SHALL GOD DESTROY; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He can "say" that the destruction is in this age only, and not at the Judgment Seat. But the CONTEXT refutes him. All admit that verse 15 refers to the Judgment Seat of Christ. But if we are to believe that verses 16 and 17 only apply to this life (in spite of the context), what would this do to Revelation 20 and the judgment of the wicked at the Great White Throne? The Bible teaches that they are judged according to their works, and then verse 15 reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Revelation 20:15</strong> And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do not these people go into the Lake of Fire at the Great White Throne, after their resurrection? But if we are to interpret the Bible the same way many interpret the warnings to Christians, then we would have to argue that verse 15 (in Revelation 20) is a sudden change of context, and that it only refers to a temporal judgment in this life! I do not believe this for a minute. The context of verse 15 is the final judgment day. And, in the same manner, the context of verse 17 (in 1 Corinthians 3) is the Judgment Seat of Christ for Christians, before the Millennial Kingdom is established.</p>
<p>Vance writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...Faust has the fire trying the Christian himself..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what does 1 Corinthians 3:15 say?:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>1 Corinthians 3:15</strong></em> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but HE HIMSELF shall be saved; yet so as BY FIRE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Vance's statement that, "He bases this on a misinterpretation of...I Cor 3:13...", implies that this Scripture is the only proof-text in my 454 page book. In fact, it is only the icing on a full cake of proof-texts.</p>
<p>Vance obviously believes that because the Bible says that a man's WORKS will be tried, that this means that the MAN who did the works, will not suffer the chastisement. Let us test this theory with the Scriptures in Revelation 20:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Revelation 20:12</strong></em> ...and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vance certainly believes that the wicked at the Great White Throne are judged "according to their WORKS." Yet, this does not grant them immunity from suffering eternally in fire. They will not find on that great day, any grounds to say, "But You only warned us about our WORKS being judged, not our BODIES!"</p>
<p>Also, although Vance speaks briefly of "...every Christian receiving 'the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad, (2 Cor 5:10)...", he doesn't even offer a hint of what he thinks it means to RECEIVE for the BAD. It is sometimes rumored that he and Ruckman believe in the possibility of some sort of STRIPES for some Christians at the Judgment Seat (Luke 12:47). Is his disagreement with my book simply that I say the STRIPES can be administered by FIRE, and he sees them administered some other way? If so, let him come out in the open and say so.</p>
<p>There are some things that seem a bit inconsistent to me. Brethren often preach themselves red about how Jesus can "slay the Christian" and "take him to the woodshed." But we are to believe that when Jesus appears, on the DAY OF JUDGMENT, that He has to suddenly tie His HANDS behind His back!:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Hebrews 10:30</strong></em> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge HIS PEOPLE.31 It is a fearful thing to fall INTO THE HANDS of the living God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as He is INVISIBLE, we are to believe that He can SLAY unfaithful Christians; but when He ever APPEARS, are we to then believe that He cannot touch a single hair on their heads? Doesn't this sound a bit strange? I challenge every reader to search the Scriptures, and see if it is true that Jesus will suddenly tie His hands behind His back at the Judgment Seat of Christ! Whatever severity of discipline that Jesus can administer in this age of patience, He may certainly administer on the day when He finally comes to reckon with His people.</p>
<p>Next, Vance writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In reply to the charge that this teaching sounds like purgatory, Faust responds that the 'Biblical truths of millennial exclusion and millennial chastisement were perverted into Rome's monstrous Purgatory' (p.90)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all Vance writes on this subject (he is obviously short on space). I am glad that he gives one of the arguments of the book here. I have a whole chapter on this objection. Rome teaches that temporary suffering is only for those who have worked their way to eternal salvation by avoiding big sins. The temporary punishment in the mythological Purgatory is a final suffering added to their former works, to earn ultimate salvation. My book (and the former Christians it quotes) believe in salvation by grace through faith alone. There is no work (past, present or future) whereby a person can earn eternal salvation. The "work" is provided by the Blood of Jesus on the Cross. Any chastisement at the Judgment Seat, or during the Millennial age, cannot add a single ounce to our eternal security. This is why the foremost writers on Kingdom exclusion for unfaithful Christians, have been the foremost writers against Rome (Govett, Pember, Panton, Fry, Nee, etc.). We would rather be accused of having a Judgment Seat of Christ that resembles Purgatory, than to have a salvation gospel the same as the pope's "gospel." And, as we shall see, if you do not apply many of these Biblical warnings to believers during the Millennium, you will have no other recourse but to teach some form of ETERNAL SALVATION BY WORKS (to the delight of Rome). This eternal salvation by works may come in the form of Romanism, Arminianism (backloading), Hyper-Calvinism (front-loading), or even Hyper-Dispensationalism. But regardless of the form it takes, scores of passages in the Bible must be interpreted in a manner that obscures the true Gospel, and brings forth the prophesied revival of Rome (Revelation 17).</p>
<p>This brings us to the next statement by brother Vance:</p>
<blockquote><p>"To disagree with how he applies certain Scriptures, is to be labeled a Bullingerite or hyper-dispensationalist (pp.76, 266)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this certainly is not true. I only label people BULLINGERITES who teach WHAT BULLINGER TAUGHT about the Book of Revelation. Bullinger taught that the Lord's words to the Seven Churches did not apply doctrinally to seven literal churches in the first century. He taught that all of these "churches" are TRIBULATIONAL. Bullinger (known as the originator of hyper-dispensationalism) also taught that the majority of the New Testament did not apply doctrinally to Christians in this age. Vance (and Ruckman) teaches that the MAJORITY OF HUMANS have been (or will be) SAVED BY A MIXTURE OF FAITH AND WORKS. They teach that only Christians in this age (beginning somewhere in Acts, to the pretribulational Rapture) are saved by grace through faith alone. The mass of humanity (billions) in the Old Testament (and some of the New Testament), people in the Tribulation Period, and people in the Millennium, are all (according to Vance and Ruckman) saved by faith and works (and this salvation can be lost).</p>
<p>This teaching uses much of Bullinger's system (without denying water baptism for this age). However, it goes beyond it in other respects. Ruckman (and Vance) are not the first to hold that people in the majority of dispensations in the Bible are saved by grace through works (this has been Rome's view for centuries). But they are the first to teach this view, while at the same time holding that people IN THIS AGE ONLY are saved by grace through faith alone.</p>
<p>My refutation of Bullingerism is found in my book. I demonstrate how his views lead to antinomianism (no accountability for sin; not even a loss of a crown, etc.). It is a travesty of interpretation to claim that every inspired word written to first century churches does not doctrinally apply to these same churches, but to others in the future. Whatever one attempts to do with the warnings to the Seven Churches, or the warnings in Hebrews, it is folly to claim that the warnings do not apply to the people in the first century to whom they were addressed. Prophetic interpretations do not override the literal, doctrinal application of warnings and promises to the people to whom they are written.</p>
<p>In the eighth paragraph, Vance writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Just what does a Christian have to do in order to not be raised with a body sufficient to abide the fire of the Judgment Seat of Christ? Faust responds: practice 'disobedience and sloth' (p. 143), 'practice rebellion and unfaithfulness' (p. 215)..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may easily turn this question around on brother Vance. He believes that if a Christian does not "suffer" with Christ, he will not reign with Christ (2 Timothy 2:12). Therefore, Vance believes that REIGNING with Christ is conditioned upon SUFFERING (for example, see Vance's, "The Other Side of Calvinism," p.589). The difference between our views is that I do not believe that non-reigning Christians will ENTER the Kingdom at all. The so-called "street-sweepers" in the Millennium will come from the mortal nations that populate the Kingdom (not from saints from this age). Everyone who enters the Kingdom from this age will REIGN (carefully check the following verses: Revelation 17:14, 5:10, 20:4,6). Yet, Vance believes that some saints will not reign with Christ. But he obviously does not see that his question can be equally applied to his own view. Just what does a Christian have to do in order to not be raised TO REIGN with Christ? How many sins will cause him to forfeit the reign? What sins, and to what degree, will cause the Christian to forfeit his Millennial reign? But alas, Vance never tells us what a sin of this nature consists of. If he does tell us exactly what sins will cause a Christian to forfeit his reign with Christ, then Vance will have found his answer to his question! The only difference between us is that he believes the non-reigning Christian somehow remains in the Kingdom, and I believe that he goes to prison, and misses the Kingdom. Vance himself has written that our views are very close in some respects. Therefore, this last "objection" in paragraph eight is no objection at all. Even those who see on the possible loss of a few jewels on a crown, according to Vance, must be able to tell us exactly where the line is for losing these jewels. The point is, the Bible teaches that we are to only have "confidence" (based on fighting the good fight, etc.) of gaining the Millennial prize. We are not to judge ourselves worthy before the time, or presumptuously think we stand (1 Corinthians 4:3,4; 10:12, etc.). The sins that will disbar us from reigning are listed in 1 Corinthians 6, Galatians 5, and Ephesians 5.</p>
<p>In paragraph ten, Vance writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In addition to these problems, 'The Rod: Will God Spare It?' suffers from too many assumptions..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vance only asserts this point. He does not overcome any of the proofs offered for the minor points that he raises. Furthermore, most of these so-called assumptions do not greatly affect the major premises of the book (my belief that Paul wrote Hebrews, etc.).</p>
<p>Vance begins to nitpick in his eleventh paragraph what he calls "minor" notes. For example, he doesn't like the fact that Scripture references are fully spelled out. His implication appears to be that I wanted to make the book seem longer than it really is. When in reality, we are living in an age when many people are so ignorant of Scripture, I WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ABBREVIATIONS! And I put a space between paragraphs for the same reason. I wrote my book to hopefully be READ by as many as possible in this generation, when reading is a rare habit.</p>
<p>And if Vance will waste space calling attention to such "minor notes," perhaps he should take a look at his own writings. My book is 454 pages. Yet, in barely 4 pages, Vance makes the following mistake:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...'The Rod'...suffers from too many assumptions....to walk in the flesh means to suffer for Christ (p. 73)..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where in the world do I teach the blasphemous statement that "walking in the flesh" is the same as "suffering for Christ"? I do, however, on page 73, write:</p>
<blockquote><p>"To walk in the flesh is to REFUSE to suffer for Christ."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we will assume that Vance's words contain a typographical error by Vance, or the editor. But we will refrain from further nitpicking.</p>
<p>In Vance's twelfth paragraph, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"One other teaching of Faust that is strangely omitted from the book (except for a veiled reference in the glossary...) is the doctrine of the selective rapture....Faust apparently believed that this teaching would unnecessarily turn people away from 'accountability truth.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I hold that the selective (pre-trib) rapture is a part of accountability truth. But my book concentrates on KINGDOM exclusion (not pre-trib rapture exclusion). Ironically, similarly, the number one objection made to the selective rapture is that it is an obscure teaching (without many adherents in history). This objection is absolutely laughable. There are so many great Christians that believed in a selective pre-trib rapture that I would have had to almost double the book (e.g. men like early Baptist writer J.R. Graves, George N.H. Peters, G.H. Pember, John Wilkinson, Hudson Taylor, to name a few). But I decided that the subjects should remain distinct (since there are some people Bible teachers who hold to kingdom exclusion, who nevertheless do not believe in a selective rapture).</p>
<p>But if we are to point out so-called "veiled references," we might call attention to the fact that in his 788 page book against Calvinism, Vance barely mentions the fact that he believes that the majority of humanity has been saved by faith AND WORKS. And when this doctrine of his is implied in his book, there is no elaboration. Vance apparently believed that this teaching would unnecessarily turn people away from his views against Calvinism.</p>
<p>Vance's thirteenth paragraph (watch out for the number thirteen), concludes by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Aside from calling attention to the serious nature of the Judgment Seat of Christ, the book is at best a curiosity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what, may we ask, does Vance find so "serious" about the Judgment Seat of Christ? He never tells us. Vance continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It is recycled Pember, Lang, Govett, and Panton with some additional twists that will further drive people away from real 'accountability truth.' By inventing a Protestant Purgatory, it is Faust who holds defective views on accountability truth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If my book is recycled Pember, Lang, Govett, and Panton (not to mention R.E. Neighbour, R.T. Ketcham, Watchman Nee, H.W. Fry, A.J. Tilney, W.F. Roadhouse, S.S. Craig, Edwin Wilson, W.P.Clark, Philip Mauro, G. F. Poynder, A.T. Schofield, Joseph Sladen, William Burgh, and scores of others!), then how is it that I am inventing a Protestant Purgatory? How can I be supposedly "recycling" something, and "inventing" something at the same time? Furthermore, Vance obviously believes that by calling the teaching a name ("Protestant Purgatory") he has refuted it. I could easily call his brand of dispensationalism "Bullinger on LSD." I do not know how anyone can teach that the majority of people who have ever lived (minus the last two-thousand years) have been saved by faith and works (and that this salvation can be lost). Furthermore, I would take a Protestant "Purgatory" any day, over a "Roman Catholic gospel" (which is no gospel). And if the warnings do not refer to the Millennium, they MUST refer to eternity (and thus eternal salvation by works). The amazing thing is that Vance would agree with this statement. He simply believes that the warnings in Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 10 (etc.) apply to the future Tribulation Period. This is how he gets around the Pauline Epistles. The problem, however, is that there has NEVER been a time when ANY MAN could be eternally saved by faith and works. And it is impossible to apply the warnings in Hebrews to people in the future, and not have them equally apply to the people to whom they are addressed in the first century!</p>

<p>Yet, Vance does not believe that ANY BLOOD-BOUGHT BELIEVER will be SECURE in the Tribulation Period. I also believe that believers are accountable, "but secure now and forever." But Vance believes that this present security cannot exempt any believer from being slain by God. He believes 1 Corinthians 11:30. Yet, if being SLAIN in this life, in the day of God's patience, does not contradict SECURITY, then why would being temporarily chastised at the Judgment Seat, in the day of reward according to works, contradict SECURITY?</p>
<p>Vance's review makes too many UNSUPPORTED accusations. It does avoid the bombastic tirades of many detractors. It is Vance that has assumed that the warnings in the Pauline Epistles are DIFFERENT than the warnings to believers in Matthew, Hebrews, Jude, Revelation, etc.</p>

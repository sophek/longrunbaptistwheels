===========================================

-Please remember to visit our web site http://www.kingdombaptist.org/sermons.cfm under audio sermons for our recent messages. You may also find some of them at:  http://www.sermonaudio.com.
Some recent sermons:

"Cross-Dressing The Mind" (5-20-07)

There is also a series preached on health, dealing with caffeine, cane sugar, chocolate, etc., examining the history, secular and Christian, the dangers, etc., and asking the differences between such things and illegal drugs such as cocaine.

Also, you will find some good messages from special speakers (Brothers Dixon and Jackson).

-A Call to Christians: If you are not called to be a pastor, or the Lord has not opened the door for this ministry, you should be in a godly church supporting a pastor. Time is slipping away:

Ephesians 3:21 Unto him be glory IN THE CHURCH by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

THE NEW, CATHOLIC-ISLAMIC AMERICA
*****************************************

The aftermath of the American Revolution allowed a so-called "peaceful Catholicism" to invade the shores of the new America. After going to war to keep Catholicism away (a forgotten fact in today's politically-correct history classrooms), the new country freely welcomed a smiley-face-Catholicism in the name of liberty, after the war. Other than discerning men like Samuel F.B. Morse [see previous Kingdom Alerts], few realized the Catholic plan to invade and change America from within by Catholic immigration. After more than a century, sleepy Americans are still not aware of what has hit us in this land. Many are now stirring a bit because of the economic and social impacts of illegal immigration. Yet, very few have realized that the religious and political face of America has begun to look like Mexico, and that these circumstances have been planned for over a century! Take a look at the vast number of Catholics who are running for president, just among Republicans (e.g. Giuliani, Brownback, Tommy Thompson). And notice how quickly these men endorsed "torture" (as long as you call it by another name). I take no delight at the thought of "President Giuliani" armed with the Patriot Act. Remember the present Pope (like Jimmy Carter) believes that "fundamental Christians" are the most dangerous enemies! As long as Americans perceive of terrorists on the outside, they applaud unbridled power. But what happens when "hate crime" legislation defines fundamental Christians as "terrorists"? Our kingdom is not of this world. But this does not mean that we are to be foolish, and that we must openly welcome a revived "Spanish Inquisition" in the name of "Patriotism."

A recent article in the "Dallas Morning News" reveals that my previous warnings about illegal immigration in the Kingdom Alert, over the years, are quickly coming to fruition:

"Hispanics leaving imprint on religion in Dallas, across U.S. - Study details Catholic surge, Latino imprint on worship - A major study released Wednesday offers a close look at how Hispanics are changing the way religion is practiced in the United States - and how American culture is affecting the faith of Hispanics...Since most Hispanics are Catholic, the local diocese may be the most transformed. The Dallas Diocese has swelled from about 200,000 in 1990 to about a million members today. And most of the newcomers are Hispanic..."
("The Dallas Morning News," April 26, 2007)

Samuel F.B. Morse saw this coming well over a century ago. We know our Bible (and other, fundamental Christians who believed it, like Pember, Govett, Panton, etc., who warned of Catholic Rome's revival, on the basis of Revelation 17) predicted this state of affairs for the whole world. The whore sits on "many waters" (peoples):

"Pass TRUE immigration reform...current reform proposals would allow up to 60 million more immigrants into our country, according to the Heritage Foundation. This is insanity."
(Ron Paul)

In a similar manner, the response to 9-11 (like the worthy response to Catholic tyranny in the American Revolution) has done more to advance the cause of Islam than anything that might have been imagined. 9-11 and the Iraq War allowed politicians and commentators to embrace a "new and peaceful Islam." Official prayers were offered up to "Allah" for the first time in America. Happy Masons (who desire to unite all religions) must be leaping with joy! The Masonic goal has always been to "mainstream" Catholicism, Islam, etc. How strange that an organized response to so-called "extreme" Catholic or Islamic tyranny actually helps mainstream these religions, while it marginalizes or blackballs fundamental Christianity.


***********************************
THOUGHTS ON RON PAUL
***********************************
It is common among Bible-believing Christians, in a discussion of politics, to have someone say, "It would be great if Ron Paul would run for president!" When faced with Hillary, and neo-con Republicans, it is refreshing, to say the least, that such a man as Ron Paul is actually running. He claims to be a protestant Christian. However, there is no evidence that this former physician could be considered a fundamentalist Christian in Bible doctrine. He is, however, a political fundamentalist. Like the founders of our country (some of whom were Deists), he is a champion of political liberty. For example, I do not think you will have to worry about Ron Paul endorsing legislation in favor of the pharmaceutical companies forcing their brain drugs on American school children. He is one of the few who have taken a stand against this invading behemoth.

There are two amazing things about his campaign. First, he is leaving the talking heads with their mouths wide open, as they stutter to explain how he wins almost every poll. Second, the conservatives who should be jumping for joy to have a true conservative running, are silent when it comes to Ron Paul. It reveals that the same thing has occurred in the political arena that has occurred in Christian fundamentalism: Those who embrace the original roots and true fundamentals, and actually take a stand for what others only profess (or used to profess), are shunned and ridiculed. Neo-conservatism has followed in the footsteps of neo-fundamentalism.

Ron Paul has been largely (perhaps purposely) misunderstood by his detractors. When asked what he would do about Osama Bin Laden if he were president, Ron Paul replied, "I'd go after him!" He believes the Iraq war distracted from this original, worthy mission.

I have shown for years that Iraq is stage-setting for tribulation prophecies. The week we supposedly "won the war," I noted in the Kingdom Alert that the men of the opposing army simply put on civilian clothes and welcomed our troops to "Vietnam"! I did not know by what power Babylon would be rebuilt (by Muslim power, or American, U.N etc.).  I still do not know how it will be finished. I only know that it is being rebuilt today and it will surely be completed to fulfill Old Testament prophecies.

Ron Paul does not blame America for 9-11. He does, however, put some of the blame on American policy: "I blame bad policy." And I agree that it is dishonest to claim that an informed questioning of policy is somehow unpatriotic. I do not think the founders of our nation would concur with such a claim. Is it really difficult to imagine what they would have thought of The Patriot Act? They would be much more alarmed by such a willful welcoming of shackles than they would the suicidal, Muslim terrorists attacking America.

I think (along with some commentators) that Ron Paul should state more clearly that Islamic "policy" will not be content to "let us alone" if we simply play nice. This is a weakness in some Libertarians. Yet, he makes a good case when he implies that American policy has inflamed tensions.

Ron Paul is against the "War on Terror" because, as he says, "You can't have a war against a tactic...it is deliberately vague...in order to justifyâ€¦perpetual war..."

Ron Paul's goal is to bring what could, ironically, be called a "revolution." He wants to awaken Americans to constitutional government. The country has strayed so far away from the original intent of the founders that it is almost revolutionary to proclaim that politicians should actually live up to their oath concerning the Constitution! In this age, Big Brother has become Big Mama (and it was never meant to be Big Brother).

The truth of the matter is that America deserves Hillary Clinton. Most American Christians deserve Hillary Clinton. We all have sinned. But the Bible commands us to pray for political leaders - not only that they will be saved and love the Lord God - but first, so that, "we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty." (1 Timothy 2:2). If we are commanded to pray for such an end, it certainly is not wrong to add works to our prayers, where possible, for this worthy goal. If the Jews were commanded to seek the peace of Babylon, where they were led into captivity, we may, and must, seek the peace of America:

Jeremiah 29:7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.

If God's people pray, repent and humble ourselves, and cry out to God, He can bring His blessings to our land. But we must confess our sins, and that we are willing to depend upon HIM!

"It is impossible!" say most Christians. "Ron Paul could never win." But with God all things are possible. Who would have ever guessed that Ron Paul would have won the MSNBC poll? And then, after being effeminately interrupted and haughtily rebuked by Mr. Planned Parenthood, who would have ever imagined that Ron Paul would go on to dominate the Fox poll for most of the evening?

Certainly, we must beware of putting undue confidence in men:

Psalms 118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.

However, it is lazy and reckless to believe that this neutralizes the obligation to pray and hope for honest, faithful men to be raised up in our land:

Proverbs 14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.

Proverbs 29:2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

I therefore pray that Ron Paul (or some other worthy man) will be elected, and that he will begin to dismantle the welfare-state that has tempted many Christians to idolatry.

But regardless, as always, we look for the coming of the Lord Jesus to bring true, lasting peace to this earth. Any revival or quietness the Lord may be bring in the mean-time, in His mercy, will be temporary. This world is destined for perils and destruction. Pray for good leaders, but look up!

******************************************************************
IS ISLAMIC TERRORISM A DIVINE JUDGMENT UPON AMERICAN CHRISTIANS?
******************************************************************

Ron Paul partially blames U.S. policy for the Islamic terrorism against America. Most popular conservatives responded to his claim with sighs, gasps and fainting. What would these people do if they heard the truth that Americans (and especially American Christians) have provoked God to judge their land? Quietness in the land is a blessing for which we are commanded to pray (Jeremiah 29:7, 1 Timothy 2:1-2). When God's people in the Old Testament did evil in His sight, He sold them into bondage (Judges 4:1-2, 13:1, etc.). God certainly sent spoilers upon the ancient Jews; and it appears that He later raised up spoilers against the Roman Empire. Is America immune from such Divine judgments? The Bible teaches that "unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required" (Luke 12:48). Most modern, American Christians have taken peace and safety in the land for granted. Our churches have used "liberty for an occasion to the flesh" (Galatians 5:13). What has been said by God concerning ancient Sodom, could certainly be said about American Christianity today:

Ezekiel 16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.

How long will God allow His people to be in peace when they are silent, or even amused by sin (Proverbs 14:9)?:

Ephesians 5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.

It may seem "absurd" to claim that we have unsettled our land by such disobedience; but it is the SAFEST position to take. The Jews of old resisted their own preachers who warned them of the rod of judgment (i.e. invaders in their land) by pompously claiming that God would never do such a thing to His own, privileged people:

Jeremiah 23:10 For the land is full of adulterers...
11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.
14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

Have we hardened ourselves against some truth or commandment based on emotional reasons? Let us pray that the Lord would reveal to us where we have erred. Let us not be proud and stubborn as we witness our land being invaded by Islamic terrorists and illegal immigrants. Let us rather confess our sins, humble ourselves, and seek mercy from the Lord in the face of the judgment we deserve.

***************************************************************
THE SUFFERING OF THE LORD FOR OUR SIN, BY MIKE BERZINS
***************************************************************

It is clear from the Scriptures that Jesus Christ suffered and died on the cross, shedding His own Blood, to pay for our sins. Some say that the Lord's suffering did not end when He said, "It is finished," but instead entered a new phase of torment in hell.


ARGUMENT FROM LOGIC

"Jesus paid our penalty for sin. Part of that penalty includes suffering in hell. Therefore the Lord must have suffered in hell."

This is the logic used by proponents of the "Lord suffered in hell" doctrine. According to this logic, Christ's work on the cross is not a sufficient propitiation for our sin, because it does not pay the complete punishment for sin. Without Scriptural backing, this logic means as much as the Russellite's (i.e. so-called J.W.'s) logic that a loving God would not torment anyone for ever and ever. The Scriptures clearly show that regardless of the "logic" employed by the Russellite, God does cast into the lake of fire, and that it is a place of conscious punishment. The answer from logic to the Russellite is that God is not only a God of love, but a God of justice, and a God of holiness. A sin against an infinitely holy God requires an infinite punishment. The fact that the logic does not make sense to a Russellite is irrelevant, because the Scriptures are clear.

Likewise, the Scriptures clearly state that the Blood of Christ is a sufficient propitiation for our sins (this will be conclusively shown later). Therefore, further suffering after the completion of the atonement, (which was accomplished on the cross), would be false, regardless of one's view of whether it was "logical." The answer to the "Lord suffered in hell" view from logic would be thus: Surely one doesn't believe the Lord is still suffering in some manner in hell, now and forever. If not, then in one sense, He didn't really pay the penalty we would have to pay, since the unbeliever is tormented forever and ever. Whatever "logic" one uses to explain the fact that Jesus is not in hell forever, the same "logic" can apply to how the Lord's suffering on the cross can be a complete bearing of our deserved punishment in hell.

In addition, according to the Scriptures, no one (saved or lost) remains in "hell" for ever. The unsaved eventually get cast into the lake of fire and brimstone [see Revelation 20:13-15]. Unless one holds to the position that the Lord was cast into the "lake of fire" as part of His suffering for sin, one's position could also be said to be "illogical."

I think the above has clearly shown that mere "logic" will not carry the argument either way. We need to look at the Scriptures, and after seeing what they say, our "logic" will proceed from what the Scriptures say. Next, we will get into the Scriptures and look at the argument from typology.

ARGUMENT FROM TYPE

Since there is no clear, direct statement of the Lord's suffering in hell, the "Lord suffered in hell" proponent has to try to find the doctrine in the Old Testament figures. Many of the types of Christ involve three components: the shedding of the sacrifice's blood; the burning of the sacrifice with fire; and the eating of the sacrifice. Exodus 12 seems to have the most to say about the manner of using fire in the preparation of the sacrifice, so we will take a look at this type in detail.

First, consider the relevant passage in its totality:

Exodus 12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

Next, see how the type applies verse by verse:

Exodus 12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

Jesus Christ was literally a male. There are verses that directly state this. (I trust one can find these himself).

Exodus 12:6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

Jesus Christ was literally killed by the congregation of Israel in the evening. There are verses that directly state this.

Exodus 12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses...

Jesus Christ's Blood was literally shed. There are verses that directly state this.

Exodus 12:7...wherein they shall EAT it.

Was Jesus Christ's flesh LITERALLY eaten?

Exodus 12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

Was Jesus Christ's flesh literally eaten? Was His flesh literally roasted with fire? Was His soul literally eaten and was His soul literally roasted with fire? What would make one think that His soul was literally roasted with fire, but His soul was not literally eaten?

The other elements of the type mentioned previously (lamb without spot; shedding his blood; etc) are directly said to be fulfilled by the Scriptures. Where are the Scriptures that state Jesus Christ was literally roasted with fire?

Exodus 12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

Is the eating here a foreshadowing of a LITERAL physical eating? A Roman Catholic might think so. If not, why assume the fire foreshadows a literal and physical fiery suffering, seeing there is no Scriptural statements that either the eating or the fire is literally applied to the Lord.

Exodus 12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

So, do you need to have your loins girded, with shoes on your feet and a staff in your hand to eat the Lord? Or at some point does the type no longer exactly typify the Lord's sacrifice? Wouldn't the logical place for the literal type to end be at the point where the Bible no longer expounds on the type? The New Testament is filled with expositions of the literal sinlessness of Christ and the necessity of His literal, shed Blood on the cross, and His literal resurrection from the dead. Where are the expositions on His alleged, literal suffering in hell?

DIRECT SCRIPTURAL EXPOSITIONS OF THE SUFFERING OF CHRIST IN HIS BODY (WITH A CONSPCIOUS ABSENCE OF ANY EXPOSITION OF CHRIST'S SUFFERING AFTER HIS DEATH ON THE CROSS)

Some New Testament passages which expound what Christ accomplished for us on the cross as well as what Christ accomplished for us with his resurrection:

Hebrews 10:19-20 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, HIS FLESH...

1 Peter 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own BODY on the TREE, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose STRIPES ye were healed.

Hebrews 10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the BODY of Jesus Christ once for all.

1 Peter 1:18-19 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious BLOOD of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

1 Peter 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

Romans 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his BLOOD, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

Romans 4:25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was RAISED again for our justification.

Romans 5:9 Much more then, being now justified by HIS BLOOD, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.

We see from the above verses that wherever the suffering of the Lord in HIS FLESH is said to accomplish something for the Christian, we also see nearby Scriptures concerning the resurrection.

And this is only scratching the surface of the available Scriptures. What we do NOT see is any place where Christ's alleged suffering in hell is said to accomplish anything!:

Hebrews12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured THE CROSS, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

Notice that Jesus endured the cross and is set down at the right hand of God. Where is the mention that He endured anything other than what He endured on the cross?

WHAT THE BURNT OFFERING TYPIFIES

Hebrews 9:11But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

Notice in the above passage how the BLOOD of bulls and goats and even the ASHES of an heifer are compared and contrasted to the BLOOD of Christ (Blood that was shed on the cross, not Blood that was roasted in hell). These ashes that were used for purification are not representative of Christ's roasted soul; if they were, they would not be contrasted with the Blood of Christ.

The blood is shed and the body burned without the camp. The blood is brought by the high priest into the holiest of all. This veil dividing the holiest of all was rent when Jesus proclaimed on the cross that it is finished:

Hebrews 13:11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.

The tabernacle was in a movable camp. After the blood was shed, the body was burned. The suffering and destruction of the beast occurred completely without the camp. The temple replaced the tabernacle and was in the city of Jerusalem instead of in a camp. Similarly, as the beast shed its blood and had its body destroyed outside of the camp, the Lord shed His Blood and offered up His body outside the gate of the city.

"Suffered without the gate" corresponds to "burned without the camp." Since the suffering occurred "without the gate," that is, on Calvary, then the beast that was burned is a figure of the location of the suffering of Christ, which occurred on Calvary!

This is the only passage I am aware of that compares the burning of a sacrifice with the Lord's suffering; and it explains this suffering as having occurred "without the gate." The gate was in Jerusalem. The location is what is significant here, which is why verse 13 goes on to say how we should "go forth therefore unto him without the camp." There is no way that this suffering can be taken to have occurred in HELL.

OBJECTIONS

"Jesus did go to hell and hell is a place of suffering. Why did he go to hell if he was not suffering?"

Hell can refer to the heart of the earth in general; not just the area of burning punishment. Here is just a brief summary of the some of the evidences that paradise is in the heart of the earth:

Jesus said "Today thou shalt be with me in paradise" when He in fact did not go to the
third heaven until after His resurrection, but instead went to the heart of the earth. Samuel
came up from the heart of the earth when Saul consulted the witch of Endor. Samuel was
a saved man.

The figure in Ezekiel 31 shows that the trees of Eden (i.e. paradise) were in the nether
parts of the earth and it was in some sense a place of comfort. In addition, the idea that
Jesus went to the burning hell does not necessarily indicate that Jesus suffered there. If
Jesus went there, He was walking around like He did when the Son of God walked in the
midst of the fire with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and was not hurt by the flame.

Here is what the Lord could have been doing if some will insist He visited a burning hell:

1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

The Lord preaching to spirits in prison would be a reason to go to the burning hell without Him having to suffer.

Seeing as there is clear, Scriptural proof showing that the propitiation for sin was accomplished on the cross, and none indicating that the Lord accomplishing anything by suffering in hell, and that the Scriptures give other reasons for why the Lord might have went to the burning hell, why would the Lord's journey to hell make one think that He suffered there? "Logic" is not enough. "Types" are not enough. Where is the expository Scripture?

A FEW, FINAL QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

Philippians 2:6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

What death was Christ obedient unto? The death of the cross or a death in hell? Which death is the Bible referring to when it says "Wherefore, God also hath highly exalted himâ€¦"?

I Corinthians 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.

What is the Lord's death that we are to shew until he comes? Is it the memory of his body broken on the cross, and His Blood shed on the tree? Should we remember His soul being burnt in hell until He comes!?

Colossians 1: 20 And, having made peace through the BLOOD of his CROSS, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
22 In the BODY of his FLESH through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

Does Christ reconcile ourselves to Him with His Blood, or by His suffering in hell? With all these verses speaking plainly about the Lord's flesh and blood suffering on the cross, where is one that speaks plainly about the Lord suffering in hell?

What exactly was finished on the cross, and why was the veil rent in twain when the Lord said, "It is finished"?

[This great article by Brother Mike Berzins is very timely, and his points are well argued. We are blessed to have him in our church at Kingdom Baptist. I have some additional information on the sufferings of the Lord in our sermon series on Luke 22 (see sermons such as, "The Cup That Remained" etc.). Let us shun the emotionally driven arguments that minimize the cross of Christ as insufficient punishment to atone for our sins. Our sins deserve eternal torment. But, as Brother Berzins argued, Christ's torment was not eternal. Why? The great value of the Son of God as sinless man negated the necessity. Yet, if His value negated the need for eternal torment (which we all deserved), why then does it not also negate this alleged temporary punishment of Christ in hell? The worth of the Son of God as sinless man required only the death of Christ in His body to redeem sinners from eternal damnation in the lake of fire. If this is not true, then we need a new hymn book! All of the great hymns are about the Blood (not the burning soul of Jesus in fire).  I exhort you all to flee this doctrine. - Joey Faust]

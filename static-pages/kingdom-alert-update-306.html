SALVATION: NO ROOM FOR BOASTING! (PART 2):

Ephesians 2 (6-29-08) 

TEXT: Ephesians 2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

There is no place for man's boasting in our salvation. We have covered these phrases carefully last week (especially verses 2-7).

Verses 8 and 9, sum it all up again. But let's deal specifically with these phrases. 

"By grace" = free unmerited favor.

"Are ye" = Don't be confused by the beautiful present tense of our AV:

Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us...

2 Timothy 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace...

But if I have been saved, then I am saved, presently! It is not something that runs out, or fades away:

Ephesians 5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:

1 Corinthians 1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus...

So we are dealing with a present salvation that was begun in the past. It is by grace! This is why the Holy Ghost could even use the present tense for the Corinthians, though they were walking as men, or unsaved men (1 Corinthians 3:3):

"It is a very singular thing that no one has risen up to preach a present salvation by works. I suppose it would be too absurd. The works being unfinished, the salvation would be incomplete...Salvation must be by grace. If man be lost by sin, how can he be saved except through the grace of God?. . .Some try to lay hold upon salvation by grace through the use of ceremonies; but it will not do. . .you cannot lay hold upon salvation by grace through your feelings. . ." 
(Spurgeon, All of Grace) 

"through faith":

This free salvation is by grace "through faith." It is not through works. This is where the majority of the Jews erred:

Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.

Romans 9:32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

Romans 4:5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

Acts 16:30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

But Dr. Houghton has ridiculed my view of this free salvation through faith (not of works) as "easy believism":

"'Easy believism'...is associated with...the writings of Robert Wilkin, Zane Hodges, Joseph Dillow, and J.D. Faust...the Reformation churches described saving faith as not only knowledge and assent but also as personal trust."
(Myron J. Houghton, Ph.D., Th.D., Faith Pulpit (March/April 2008), Faith Baptist Theological Seminary: A Critique of "Easy Believism")

Houghton, like so many, has now plunged into the mystical subjective. He invents something that is beyond knowledge and assent, that he doesn't just call trust, but personal trust. Why the added word? He adds it so he can stuff all kinds of works under it! "Do you trust Jesus? Yes. "Well, do you personally trust Him?"

It appears that we are rapidly losing the English language and the ability to communicate. However, often, when language is mystified, it simply means someone is trying to hide something. There is nothing that a man knows, that he does not trust to be true. The degree that he trusts it to be true, is the degree that he knows it to be true. If he knows it to be true, he assents to its truth. The degree that you assent to a proposition is the degree that you trust it to be true. I believe 2+2 = 4. I trust it to be true. I know it to be true. I assent to its truth. 

Likewise, I know that Jesus died for the sins of the world, and therefore He died for me, to pay for my sins so I can have everlasting life. I know this to be true. I believe it is true. I have faith that it is true. I assent to the fact that it is true. I trust that it is true. I rest in the fact that it is true. I receive it as true. I believe; I receive; I assent; I trust; I know! These are all synonymous with faith:

Acts 24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. 

People who intellectually assent to the truth that Jesus lived historically are certainly not necessarily saved. Likewise, people who assent to the fact that the Bible teaches that Jesus died for the sins of the world are not necessarily saved. A person can believe the Bible teaches something and not necessarily believe that it is true in reality. I can believe that the Koran teaches Muslims to kill Christian infidels. That certainly does not mean that I "intellectually assent" to the proposition that the Koran is the "final revelation of the last prophet"!

Houghton is against intellectual assent. It appears to simple for him. He has to find a way to make salvation by works, without calling it works. And this is not an easy task. So he tells us that the Reformers believed that faith was some kind of something beyond mere believing! 

First, why should we care too much what people who had recently escaped the Catholic Church believed? I appreciate their teachings, but why is that the standard?

Furthermore, these men who say such things either do not know any better, or they do not expect you to be able to read what the Reformers taught. Let us see what the early Reformers taught about faith. Horatius Bonar, a great premillennial Bible teacher in the 19th century, has recorded the clear words of the Reformers below. Please read these words carefully. They reveal what the Reformers clearly taught about faith:

"This great truth is well brought out in a correspondence among Luther, Melancthon and Brentius in the year 1531, which we translate and abridge. Brentius had been much perplexed on the subject of faith. It puzzled him. Christ justifies; faith justifies; how is this? Is faith a merit? Is it a work?. . .Perplexed with these questions, he wrote to Melancthon and Luther. . .'I see,' writes Melancthon, 'what is troubling you about faith. You stick to the fancy of Augustine, who, though right in rejecting the righteousness of human reason, imagines that we are justified by that fulfilling of the law which the Holy Spirit works in us. So you imagine that men are justified by faith, because it is by faith that we receive the Spirit, that thereafter we may be able to be just by that fulfillment of the law which the Spirit works. This imagination places justification in our fulfillment of the law. . .this renewing is insufficient (for justification). . .not even love, though it is the fulfilling of the law, justifies, but only faith; not because it is some excellence in us, but only because it takes hold of Christ. . .You can only rightly comprehend it by turning your eyes entirely away from the law, and from Augustine's idea about our fulfilling the law, and by fixing them wholly upon the free promise. . .I endeavored to explain this in my Apology, but on account of the misrepresentations of adversaries, could not speak out so freely as I do now with you, though saying the very same thing. When could the conscience have peace and assured hope, if we are not justified till our renewal is perfected?. . .By all means preach law and repentance to the people, but let not this true doctrine of the gospel be overlooked'. . .In the same strain writes Luther. . .To these letters Brentius replies. . .'Your letter and that of Luther showed me the truth. . . Justification comes to us neither on account of our love nor our faith, but solely on account of Christ: and yet it comes through (by means of) faith. Faith does not justify as a work of goodness, but simply as a receiver of promised mercy. . .We do not merit; we only obtain justification. Faith is but the organ, the instrument, the medium; Christ alone is the satisfaction and the merit'. . .Thus does the disciple expound the master's letter, and then adds some thoughts of his own. He fears lest, as popery perverted love, so the Reformation might come to pervert faith, putting it in the room of Christ, as a work or merit or quality, something in itself. . .Some of the soundest Christian divines have left on record their complaint as to the mistakes in this matter of faith prevailing in their day, and as to the charge of Antinomianism brought against those who, in stating justification, refuse to qualify the apostolic formula, 'to him that worketh not, but believeth.' Traill thus wrote, now nearly two centuries ago, 'If we say that faith in Jesus Christ is neither work, nor condition, nor qualification in justification, and that in its very act it is a renouncing of all things but the gift of grace, the fire is kindled; so that it is come to this, that he that will not be Antichristian must be called an Antinomian.' How strongly does this same divine state the truth in another place. When addressing a perplexed inquirer he says, 'If he say that he cannot believe on Jesus Christ. . .you tell him that believing on Jesus Christ is no work, but a resting on Jesus Christ.' How sharply does he rebuke those who would mix up the imputed and the infused: 'They seem to be jealous lest God's grace and Christ's righteousness have too much room, and men's works too little in the business of justification.' See the whole of Traill's letter on 'Justification vindicated from the charge of Antinomianism.' An old anonymous writer, a little later than Traill, uses this expression: 'The Scriptures consider faith not as a work of ours, but set in opposition to every work, whether of body or mind: 'To him that worketh not, but believeth.'"
(Horatius Bonar, God's Way of Holiness, 1864)

Amen to these words. Here is the clear, unguarded, private correspondence of the Reformers, Melancthon and Luther. They rightly saw that faith would one day be perverted into "faith-works" by the prideful boasting of man (who is humiliated by the fact that Christ would redeem people free of charge, though mere faith). If these people would teach the truth of the Judgment Seat of Christ, they would not feel that such free grace is somehow irresponsible. 

Dr. Houghton is offended that salvation is easy. He calls it "easy believism." It was not easy for the Father to give His Son. It was not easy for the Son to be spit upon and bleed to death on the Cross, and be rejected by the Father. And if "easy believism" is so "easy" then why do all the religions of the world reject it? Why do all the cults reject it? Why do all of the fluffy preachers on TV reject it? The Reformers viewed salvation by faith as the simple act of trusting in Jesus. Spurgeon agrees:

". . .a knowledge of the truth teaches us that faith is the simple act of trusting, that it is not an action of which man may boast; it is not an action of the nature of a work, so as to be a fruit of the law. . .Now it just so happens that the way of salvation by faith is so simple that it seems beneath the dignity of exceedingly clever men. May God bring them to a knowledge of this truth."
(Spurgeon, Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, Volume 26, 1880)

While it is certainly true that God gives us the power to believe, I believe the gift in this verse is the salvation, which was just previously said to be by grace, therefore, a gift.

We know, in Scripture, that the word "it" often refers back to the main subject in a verse, and not necessarily the last subject mentioned:

Leviticus 3:11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

"It," here, does refer to the alter, but to the sacrifice. The following verse is even more to the point at hand:

Ecclesiastes 3:13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

The enjoyment is the gift of God. In the same way, the being saved, is the gift of God, in Ephesians 2:

"By Grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. Salvation may be called Theodora, or God's gift. . .Salvation is the gift of God, in opposition to a wage. . .It is the gift of God: that is, it is eternally secure in opposition to the gifts of men, which soon pass away."
(Spurgeon, All of Grace)

Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

"it is the gift of God":

A gift is something that is not merited. It may, however, have some qualifications. But there is only one qualification for the gift of eternal salvation, and that is given in our text in Ephesians 2. It is "through faith":

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

Romans 5:18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

Romans 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:

Romans 4:16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed. . .

Jesus told the woman at the well, about the gift of God. If she took one. simple drink, she would never thirst again! I hope you have learned to rest in the saving truth of the Gospel. The law will cause you to have to try to get saved every few months or years. It is a never-ending cycle, because when the Lord most revives you is when you are the most humble. And when you are the most humble is when you feel, like the Publican, that you fall far below the law's demands. This is appropriate as we strive for reward and greater fellowship with God. This godly sorrow will work repentance and reformation in the life of a believer. It is an ongoing process of growth in Christ. But salvation in eternity is a free gift, and there is no way we can grow in Christ or holiness without knowing for sure that we have God's Holy Spirit and regeneration. We can never be sure of this if we must evaluate our works for eternal assurance. We would have to wait until the end of our lives, when we stand before God. Those who confuse poor souls by making them think or feel that they must perform and commit harder for eternal salvation, are robbing them of resting in the grace of God. God is able to reward those who turn His grace into lasciviousness. As Spurgeon and Bonar argued, if they pervert grace they will pervert law. We do not have to pervert His grace and Gospel to keep professing believers responsible. This is what the preaching on the Judgment Seat of Christ is for. Paul was charged by his enemies with teaching that we can sin so grace may abound. Why isn't this charge ever bought against you?

Dr. Hougton has charged me with teaching that people can sin so grace may abound. I am in good company with the Apostle Paul:

Romans 3:8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?. . .

Do the Catholics and Jews and Cultists affirm this about your preaching and teaching? I am happy to be in this class that is despised and mocked by the works-salvationists:

"'If we say that faith in Jesus Christ is. . .[the] renouncing of all things but the gift of grace, the fire is kindled; so that it is come to this, that he that will not be Antichristian must be called an Antinomian.'"
(Traill, quoted by H. Bonar)

No one who teaches what the Bible teaches about the terror of the Lord at the Judgment Seat of Christ for believers (2 Corinthians 5:9-11) can honestly and rationally be branded an Antinomian. Nevertheless, I would rather be dishonestly called an Antinomian (like Paul), than be accused of erasing distinction between Romanism and true Christianity in regard to the Gospel.

Dear friend, rest in Christ today. He is waiting for you - but He will not wait forever. Do not worry because you are in a mess. He justifies the "ungodly" (Romans 4:5, 5:6). 

And if you are already saved, shouldn't you show forth your gratitude? Do you want to give legalists ammunition? Do you want to be used to scare preachers away from dispensing the pure Gospel; the free waters of life? Present your bodies a living sacrifice in full obedience. It is your reasonable service to the Lord who has shown you and I so much mercy.

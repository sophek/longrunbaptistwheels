SUMNER'S EXTENDED REVIEW OF "THE ROD: WILL GOD SPARE IT?" IN THE NOVEMBER-DECEMBER, 2002 ISSUE OF "THE BIBLICAL EVANGELIST" (PART 1)</P><BR>  <P>A Protestant Purgatory! That is the title of brother Sumner's review of my book. I will show that it might make a better title for HIS OWN theology. He is much more in line with Rome than I am. I (and the authors I quote as fellow advocates of my position) abhor the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, along with much of everything else that has to do with Rome. I pray that many dear Catholics will be delivered from her grasp. On the other hand, my opponents are apparently pleased with a ROMAN CATHOLIC Gospel of eternal salvation (i.e. assurance through works), if it means they can escape any "appearance" of Purgatory. But Old Mother Rome (Rev.17:5) has played a trick on them. Now that so many "evangelicals" are realizing that their view of salvation ASSURANCE is much the same as Rome's view, Rome has decided to change or ignore her view of Purgatory so that it comes into line with the modern, flowery, "evangelical" view of the Judgment Seat of Christ! </P><BR>  <P>As modern Christians flee from their warnings and assign them to only "false professors," they must then strive to prove they are elect (and not only a professor) by a life of good works and "enduring to the end." Brother Sumner may think he has brought forth enough fruit to think himself a "real" Christian thus far in his life, but he must wait and see what will happen next week. To keep the warnings from applying to the Millennium (and "favoring" an archaic view of Purgatory), Sumner must logically apply the warnings to ETERNITY, and thereby teach salvation assurance through works of righteousness and enduring. The evangelicals and Catholics who joined hands and signed E.C.T. are waiting for Sumner's signature. They have also largely abandoned literal, temporal punishment in regard to accountability; but they love Sumner's "strive your whole life to prove you are elect" view of salvation assurance! </P><BR>  <P></P><BR>  <P>The fundamental and premillennial writers I quote in my book as advocates of my position were the chief opponents of Rome, and are often quoted as such in commentaries. That there is some surface similarity between literal chastisement for carnal Christians at the Judgment Seat of Christ and Rome's OLD doctrine of Purgatory, I do not deny. But there is also a similar, surface likeness between Catholic charity and the charity of true Christians! On the other hand, there is also a vast sea of difference, doctrinally. Rome adds eternal-atoning value to good works and sufferings. The true Christian only sees eternal-atoning value in the Blood of Jesus Christ on the Cross.</P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "He opens with a chapter about 'accountability truth' and insists that Christians are going to be accountable to God not only for good works as believers, but for bad ones as well. We couldn't agree more and it is something we have highlighted strongly throughout the 60 years of our ministry..."</P><BR>  <P>Based on Sumner's words above, I suppose he wants us to believe that he has given the Biblical warnings to believers due weight for over 60 years. They always tell us this. In reality, he has spent decades trying to argue out of the warnings (and talk young Christians out of them) since the day God tried to reveal them to him by the ministry of fundamentalist leaders such as R. T. Ketcham, years ago. Fundamentalists are aware of the fact that they should be preaching the "fear of the Lord" and accountability at the Judgment Seat. But the majority of Christians in this modern age do not want to hear about accountability. Therefore, it is easier for preachers to use great swelling words about how they stand for the fear of God and preach a true Judgment Seat, while they actually scratch itching ears with "ye shalt not surely die" sophistry. Yet, this "flowery bed of ease" preaching of much of modern "fundamentalism" is simply the syrupy doctrines of early, 1920 liberalism - at least in regard to Christian accountability. In that day, even the liberal heretic, Harry E. Fosdick, thought their "new view of God" was encouraging self-complacency!:</P><BR>  <P>"Indeed, the god of the new theology...has not been warranted to punish heavily; he has been an indulgent parent....the new theology...had never learned to preach on that text in the New Testament, 'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.'..." (Fosdick, "Christianity and Progress," 1922)</P><BR>  <P>But today, one can scarcely find a professing FUNDAMENTALIST who will rise up and contend against this Laodicean complacency by calling the attention of believers to their literal warnings. In regard to the Judgment Seat, many are now worse than the liberals in 1920! According to Sumner, as we will see in part 2, EVERY Christian ends up with praise at the Judgment Seat! Incredible! To Sumner, the only danger or threat for the Christian is a subjective, undefined, "receiving of loss," which, whatever it means, according to Sumner, it CANNOT mean physical or literal pain, stripes, fire, death, or banishment! Sumner never wonders why it is that God did not choose to use ONLY this type of chastisement in THIS LIFE. If this type of subjective threat (with PRAISE included!) is sufficient for the Judgment Seat, then why did God KILL Christians and make them SICK in Corinth (1 Corinthians 11)? If this type of chastisement occurs in THIS LIFE in the age of God's LONGSUFFERING, on what basis can modern preachers dogmatically deny the slightest literal stripe on the future day of JUDGMENT? It is illogical and absurd, and numerous Scriptures must be bent and explained away to maintain such a conclusion. </P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "However, when he goes on to make this accountability a punishment that denies some believers entrance into the millennial kingdom and places them in a Protestant Purgatory, we couldn't disagree more!"</P><BR>  <P>He reacts to the word "punishment," yet I show in my book the English definition of the word and what I therefore mean by it:</P><BR>  <P>"Punishment: Any pain or suffering inflicted on a person for a crime or offense...The punishment of the faults and offenses of children BY THE PARENT, is by virtue of the right of government with which the parent is invested by God himself. The species of punishment is chastisement or correction....Divine punishments are doubtless designed to secure obedience and uphold the moral order of created intelligent beings." (Webster's 1828)</P><BR>  <P>Sumner's reaction against the concept of God's Parental "punishment" is indicative of the worldliness that has entered into much of modern theology. In the 1940's and 50's, a majority of parents, for the first time, surrendered their children to the advice of the "professionals." For example, the 1945, "Woman's Home Companion" advised its readers:</P><BR>  <P></P><BR>  <P>"...when your child has a tantrum...it is a perfectly natural thing for him to do....Don't scold or PUNISH your child. Try to make him happy, do what he is interested in. PUNISHMENT will only harm his development." </P><BR>  <P>The rotten fruit of this worldly advice was manifested in the turbulence of the 1960's. Sumner's aversion to the word "punishment" for Christians at the Judgment Seat is probably due to the fact that, instead of resisting the world and enlightening it, much of modern theology has been tainted by it. Secondly, many fail to see the basic division in Scripture between eternal punishment for sin (which Christ bore in His Body on the Cross) and the temporal punishment for sin of the child of God. Jesus Christ was punished for all our sins, past, present and future and He thereby removed the eternal, positional stain of guilt. However, this does not mean that God cannot still punish His children with stripes for their faults. Christians are told to confess their sins if they want them forgiven (1 John 1:9). This has to do with maintaining fellowship, not maintaining (or proving) positional relationship (as Rome teaches). I wonder if Sumner ever asks God to forgive him for sins? Has he never confessed his sins in his Christian life? If he has, why did he do so, if they are already paid for? If Sumner answers that he confesses them to maintain fellowship and avoid chastisement, then he should not have any real objection to my book. He should see that the Bible extends this same principle to the Judgment Seat and the Millennial Kingdom. R. T. Ketcham writes:</P><BR>  <P>"[Many believe that] some believers will have no reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ, but because chastisement ends with this life, there will be none there. The difference between this common conception and the view set forth in this chapter is simply this: The principle of chastisement remains the same; the difference is in the extent to which it is carried. One halts the process at the Judgment Seat of Christ; the other allows its continuance for those who did not submit to its benefactions here. I have searched in vain for a single Scripture to prove the discontinuance of this principle at the Lordâ€™s return. On the other hand a great mass of Scriptureâ€¦seems to indicate the awful and soul-searching truth that there is such a thing as CORRECTIVE DISCIPLINE when we see Him face to face. We have been surprised to discover that MANY TEACHERS have had a conviction that this was the teaching of Scripture..."</P><BR>  <P>In the end, it does not really matter what a person calls it. Whatever a person calls it when God makes some Christians sick in Corinth and kills others, is the same thing he can call it when God afflicts carnal saints at the Judgment Seat! One may call it chastisement, punishment, scourging, or recompense. It makes no difference to me as long as the warnings are given their due weight.</P><BR>  <P>It is wrong for Sumner to use the word Purgatory as a PLACE in his objection. I plainly state that carnal Christians will go to where Jesus says they will go. I teach they will go into outer darkness:</P><BR>  <P>Matthew 25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</P><BR>  <P>At times Jesus calls this "Hell." It is the prison of the underworld which gives up its occupants at the Great White Throne after the Millennium (Revelation 20:13). The lost then spend eternity in the Lake of Fire. The saved, are reunited with Christ throughout eternity. I do not believe in a place called Purgatory. I do not believe any suffering of chastisement can make atonement and earn eternal salvation. I do not believe that anyone can pay or pray a person out of his chastisement on the day of judgment. </P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "Faust's teaching is not at all new, of course. No false teaching is. I recall being on the old Council of 14 of the General Association of Regular Baptists when we were faced with the problem of one of our highly revered and respected leaders teaching this idea, saying worldly Christians would be cast out into outer darkness as a temporary judgment for unconfessed earthly sins. He based his conclusions on a misunderstood parable, just as Faust bases many of his."</P><BR>  <P>More than likely the leader was R. T. Ketcham who I quote in my book. It is interesting that many of the men who were at the forefront of the independent, fundamental Baptist movement around the world were kingdom exclusionists! Panton led the premillennial fundamentalists in Britain, Roadhouse in Canada, R. E. Neighbour began the B.B.U., and Ketcham was a leader in the G.A.R.B.C. Sumner called it a "problem" to be faced with the teaching. It is indeed! Light brings responsibility. What then does rejected light bring to us at the Judgment Seat? Sumner states that Ketcham (if that is who he is referring to - why not name him?) based his conclusion on a misunderstood parable. We would be inclined to believe that Sumner would "straighten it out" for us. But he doesn't. Ketcham did not base his teaching entirely on parables. This can be proven by simply reading his quotes in my book.</P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "In fairness to the author and his supporters - he seems to have quite a few - he vigorously denies (and his supporters join the chorus) that he is teaching a Protestant Purgatory. The denial starts on page xii of the Foreword (by ex-Catholic priest Bill Jackson, a good man whose writings we have promoted strongly over the years)."</P><BR>  <P>Brother Bill Jackson has not been a Catholic a DAY in his life. Why would brother Sumner state such a thing without checking? It "might" give his view some much needed weight if it were true. Yet, it is not true. Imagine, here is the leader of one of the most fundamental ministries for evangelizing Catholics, writing the Foreword to my book - the book that Sumner appears to be trying to castigate as compromised with Rome in doctrine. It might be "convenient" for Sumner if it could be "implied" that perhaps Dr. Bill Jackson has not FULLY left the Catholic Church, doctrinally. However, the fact that brother Jackson has never been a Catholic a day in his life, and has spent much of his life studying the differences between Catholicism and true Christianity, certainly argues against the whole point of Sumner's rebuttal.</P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "In short, Faust denies the term, but teaches the act."</P><BR>  <P>The sole similarity between a Catholic Purgatory and my teaching is punishment after death (at the Judgment Seat). The reason for the punishment, and the merit of the punishment, and the place of the punishment, are ALL vastly different, as I will document momentarily. On the other hand, there is not much difference between the E.C.T. (i.e. Evangelical and Catholics Together) view of salvation assurance and Sumner's view. We would really like him to tell us the difference. In short, he may deny the similarity, but he certainly teaches the same view.</P><BR>  <P>SUMNER: "Faust explains the difference between his Purgatory and Rome's as being that the latter experience it [sic] 'to become a child of God and live in eternity.' In the first place he misunderstands Catholicism; its dogma teaches Catholics are already the children of God (children of Catholics are born that way, according to Rome's dogma!) and the purpose of Purgatory is refinement, making them worthy of Heaven. In short, isn't that being 'punished' for sins which Calvary apparently failed to make provision? is there much difference between the purgatories of the Vatican and Faust?"</P><BR>  <P>There are indeed many differences. However, there is little difference between Sumner's view of Gospel assurance (which he is forced into by applying Christian warnings to false professors) and the Vatican's. The statement Sumner is referring to above is taken from the glossary in the back of my book. It reads:</P><BR>  <P>"Disobedient Christians do not earn, contribute to, or keep their salvation in eternity by suffering chastisement during the millennium. The principle difference between Romeâ€™s Purgatory and chastisement in this life (which almost all conservative Christians advocate) is not that the former is after death and that the latter is in this life. The main theological difference lies in the purpose of the suffering. People in Romeâ€™s purgatory suffer to become a child of God and live in eternity. This denies the Gospel. On the other hand, the doctrine of millennial exclusion protects and guards the Gospel, since the various warnings to believers are not applied to eternity, which would compromise assurance through faith alone."</P><BR>  <P>Sumner did not deal with the real difference between by view and Rome's view. He did not deal with the fact that Rome teaches that people suffer in Purgatory to earn salvation in eternity. Sumner chose to ignore a whole chapter of quotes and arguments and deal with a summary statement in the glossary which states that imperfect Catholics must suffer in Purgatory to become "children of God." I am using the term "children of God" in an evangelical sense (since Christians are my intended readers) meaning "those that are saved in eternity." I admit the glossary could have stated this view in a more technical manner to avoid confusion. Yet, the book is filled with technical quotes concerning Purgatory. Many Catholics themselves see Purgatory as a means to becoming God's child in an eternal sense:</P><BR>  <P>"God wants us to be His family, to be His CHILDREN and share the fullness of His joy. </P><BR>  <P>But IN ORDER to be able to be TRULY 'children of God' we MUST become pure like Him, holy like Him, loving like Him, with an unselfish, undivided heart...But, at the moment of our departure from earthly life, how many of us have become divinely pure, united in every way with God, yearning to love Him only, and devoted to Him above all?...More than anything else, we must see purgatory not as the ante-chamber of hell (suggesting a similar type of suffering), but as the entrance hall of heaven, where God is All-in-all....This joy of souls in purgatory is the result of their having trustingly handed themselves over to God and accepted the purification that arises from their love and longing as their misery truly meets His mercy. Purgatory is our meeting with Christ, who loves us, and our loving acceptance of His pardoning love. It is our passage to holiness...Their love for God keeps maturing, not only in ATONING suffering and longing, but in peace and silence as well." (St. Michael Center For the Blessed Virgin Mary, www.smcenter.org/teachings_purgatory.htm)</P><BR>  <P></P><BR>  <P>"Purgatory (Lat., "purgare", to make clean, to purify) in accordance with Catholic teaching is a place or condition of temporal punishment for those who, departing this life in God's grace, are, not entirely free from venial faults, or have not FULLY PAID the satisfaction due to their transgressions." (Catholic Encyclopedia, www.NewAdvent.org)</P><BR>  <P>My view teaches that Jesus paid the full satisfaction for the eternal guilt of sins. However, as children of God, He has the right to chastise us for unconfessed sins in the Christian walk (even to the point of death) in temporal time, before eternity. This temporal time includes the Judgment Seat and the Millennium which is set before the believer as a prize. The difference between my view and Rome's view is found in the meaning of the phrase "not fully paid." Catholics add ETERNAL merit to everything. I do not believe that any suffering, either in this life or at the Judgment Seat has ETERNAL merit. No sufferings here or in the world to come can justify a person. Justification is God's righteousness imputed to our account through faith alone, apart from any works. It is instantaneous, complete to our account at the moment of faith, and can never be lost. However, a child of God CAN receive for the things done in his body; not as a payment (full or partial) for eternal salvation, but as a just recompense of reward. Notice the following excerpts from my book:</P><BR>  <P>"The Roman Catholic dogma of Purgatory was officially ratified at the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1438-45) and reaffirmed at the Council of Trent (1545-63). The concept was developed in the sixth century. Augustine (354-430) helped lay the foundation. Jerome (and many other early, professing Christians) taught that some Christians would be temporarily punished in fire, yet saved at last. Augustine, on the other hand, resisted this idea, and taught that any man that committed gross sins would burn eternally. Gregory the Great (540-604) would build upon Augustine's framework by teaching that there would be temporary punishment in fire for 'light' or venial sins, while all other sins would bring eternal damnation. Sufferings, whether for Christ (as a martyr) or for venial sins (in this life or in the intermediate state), were given redemptive value. The Biblical truths of millennial exclusion and millennial chastisement were perverted into Romeâ€™s monstrous Purgatory. Rome therefore compromised the grace of God as it relates to eternal salvation. The testimonies of the following accountability teachers will reveal the folly in branding chastisement (during the age of the millennial kingdom) as 'Purgatory.' It is an emotional straw man:</P><BR>  <P>"Most will take up the ground - 'Chastisement, but only in this life.' Your proofs, friend?...you admit, that in spite of Jesus' atonement, the chastisements of God descend on the offending believer in this life. It is no bar then to their falling on him in the next age." </P><BR>  <P>-Robert Govett (1813-1901)</P>  <P>"All denunciation of this truth as 'purgatory' condemns the Lord Jesus at least as sharply as it criticizes His commentator. Roman error on the point is lodged in making a believerâ€™s punishment hereafter a means to his fundamental salvation, an integral part of the Atonement."</P><BR>  <P>-D. M. Panton</P><BR>  <P>"It will be objected that this prospect of punishment after death for some who are ultimately to be saved savours of the Roman doctrine of purgatory. Stalwart Protestants will rush to the battle with the heaviest armaments they can command. But let the searcher for truth alone be calm.â€¦Every instructed Christian believes in purgatory in principle. The fire purges the gold that it may be fit for the kingâ€™s table. Heb.12:12; I Pet.1:6,7, indeed the whole Bible teaches this, nor is it questioned as to the ways of God our Father with His children in this life. It is therefore simply a question of whether God by His Word does or does not extend the application of this process to life after death. No new principle as to His ways is introduced. And who shall complain, or even wonder, should He thus vindicate His justice before men and angels? It is not fully exhibited in this life, even in the case of His children. The godly do not get a full reward of virtue, nor the carnal believer the due reward of his deeds. The former rightly look beyond death for their recompense; it is but consistent that the latter should then receive theirs.... This differs radically from the Romish doctrine of purgatory, for that dogma makes the suffering after death for such as go to purgatory necessary to their purification and final salvationâ€¦.Thus 'according to the Romanists the departed have to make an atonement themselves, in the purgatorial state, for the sins they have committed when in this life.' (Walter Hook, in Dr. W.F. Hookâ€™s Church Dictionary, 629)...."</P>  <P>-G.H. Lang (1874-1958) </P>  <P>[Continued in Part II of this E-mail]</P>

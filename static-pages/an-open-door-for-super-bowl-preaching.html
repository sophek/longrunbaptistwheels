        <h1>AN OPEN DOOR FOR SUPER BOWL PREACHING</h1>
        <div id="content">
            After God cursed the DFW Metroplex with bad weather for a week before the Super Bowl, He graciously let up on the winter storm long enough for Christians to have a nice church service on Sunday morning. When the weather changed on Saturday, and the ice and snow began to melt, thousands gathered in downtown Fort worth for Super Bowl festivities. Brother Jeremy Delasantos from New Mexico, and some other brethren, decided it would be a good time to preach. We gathered there near the ESPN booth, and amazingly, the city of Fort Worth wisely permitted preaching and evangelism, even with banners. Praise God for all who worked to make this happen. Â  At first, the new, temporary city code forbidding literature (obviously meant to forbid commercial literature) was applied to Christian tracts and banners. Â But by Saturday, the city was instructing police officers about the proper meaning of the law. Many revelers were brought to some sobriety, and faced with eternal questions, and calls for repentance. Does God want us to party, with blood on our hands? With millions of dead babies in America, and God and His Word cast aside in so many ways? Nineveh repented when God warned them. What are American cities doing?

Surprisingly, Arlington also, on Sunday afternoon, before and during the game, showed the same wisdom concerning street preachers. Many from our church, and a few from out of town, (a whole bus load) gathered after church to go to Arlington to preach. As Satan would have it, our bus got stuck in the mushy ground. After several attempts to free it, we called some neighbors to help. One friend was unable to move it with his truck. And finally, at the last minute, a kind neighbor came with his tractor, and, when it looked as if the tractor could not move it, it finally came out of the hole, and away we went!

Arlington, near the stadium was certainly crowded. People were everywhere, outside, near the stadium. Amazingly, the sidewalks all around the stadium were open to people â€“ even preachers and Christian street evangelists. And the police did not hinder the Christians. We were able to use large banners and bull-horns. Many dear folks from our church testified, and gave the Gospel, and warned the wicked, with our friends from out of state. Â We met other Christians there, some from New York, who came to witness. Everywhere you looked, someone was talking with revelers, and crowds of people gathered in apartments, and on sidewalks, were faced with sober preaching. Many looked down and agreed with the preaching â€“ a surprising number. Others blasphemed beyond anything I have ever heard in twenty years of street ministry. One woman covered her ears and said she wanted to party and did not want to be reminded about God. Quite a number of people video-taped the preaching.

By the time the game started, the weather began to frown, and before long the cold rain and wind began again. The people began to disperse.

In conclusion, we thank God for how He provided wonderful open doors for preaching and evangelism. Praise God for those who worked to make this open door possible. If Godâ€™s people will put their hands to the plow, in boldness, and will quit making excuses, He will show Himself strong on their behalf. How many other doors would God open, if only Godâ€™s people would be available to walk through them and use them?
